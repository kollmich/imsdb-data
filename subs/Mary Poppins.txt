Gather around</i>The constable's responstable.Now, how does that sound?Hmm...<i>Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you</i>Miss Lark likes to
walk in the park...- Grrrr.
- ...with Andrew!Arf! Arf!- Hello, Andrew.
- Arf! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!<i>Ah, Mrs Cory</i><i>A story for you</i>Your daughters were
shorter than you,but they grew.<i>Dear Miss Persimmon...</i>Yes?<i>Wind's in the east</i><i>Mist comin' in</i><i>Like something is brewin'</i><i>About to begin</i><i>Can't put me finger
on what lies in store</i><i>But I feel what's to happen</i><i>All happened before</i>Arf! Arf! Grrrr!I'm sorry. Where was I?Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.Crikey.Bless you, guv.Generosity itself,
that's what you are.No charge.Oh, it's you. Hello.Number 17 Cherry
Tree Lane, you say?All right. Come with me.This here's Cherry Tree Lane.Nice little spot, you might say.Number 17 is just down a bit.Now this imposing edifice
what first greets the eyeis the home of Admiral Boom,late of His Majesty's navy.Likes his house shipshape and
Bristol fashion at all times.- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.What he's famous
for is punctuality.The whole world takes its
time from Greenwich,but Greenwich takes its
time from Admiral Boom.What cheer, Admiral?Good afternoon!
Where are you bound?Some parties want to see number 17.- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.Some advice, young man.Storm signals are up at 17.Heavy weather brewing there.Thank you, sir.
I'll keep an eye skinned.Here we are.Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
residence of George Banks, esquire.Hello, hello, hello.
The admiral's right.Heavy weather brewing at
number 17, and no mistake.Leave her alone!Don't you be trying to stop
the wretched creature!Let her go and good riddance.I never liked her from the
moment she set foot in the door.But who'll get stuck with
the children? Me, that's who!Her and her high and mighty ways.And that face of her that would
stop a coal barge, it would.Indeed, Mrs Brill!I wouldn't stay in this
house another minutefor all the jewels in Christendom.No, Katie Nanna, don't go!Stand away from that door!What'll I tell the master
about the children?It's no concern of mine.Those beasts ran away from me.They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?You think the lion got them?They're fond of hanging
around the cage.I've said my say.I've done with this house forever.Hip, hip, hooray!Don't stumble on the way out.No, no, Katie Nanna!Mrs Banks. She's home.<i>Our daughter's
daughters will adore us</i><i>And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>Good evening,
Katie Nanna and Ellen.The meeting was glorious!Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself
to the prime minister's carriage.You should have been there!And Mrs Ainslie was
carried off to prison.Singing and scattering
pamphlets all the way!Madam, I've always given my best...Thank you, Katie Nanna.I knew you were one of us.<i>We're clearly soldiers
in petticoats</i><i>And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes</i><i>Though we adore men individually</i><i>We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid</i>Mrs Banks...<i>Cast off the shackles of yesterday</i><i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i><i>Our daughter's
daughters will adore us</i><i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i><i>"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>I don't wish to offend, but...<i>From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries</i><i>From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise</i><i>Political equality and
equal rights with men</i><i>Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again</i><i>No more the meek and
mild subservients we</i><i>We're fighting for our
rights militantly</i><i>Never you fear</i>If I may have a word...<i>So cast off the
shackles of yesterday</i><i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i><i>Our daughter's daughters
will adore us</i><i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i><i>"Well done"</i>Mrs Banks!<i>"Well done"</i>Mrs Banks!What is it, Katie Nanna?I have something to say to you.Where are the children?The children, to be
precise, are not here.They've disappeared again.That's really careless of you.That's the third time this week.The fourth, madam.I've had my fill.I'm not one to speak
ill of the children.When do you expect them home?I couldn't say. If you'd
compute my wages...Oh, gracious! You're not leaving?What will Mr Banks say?He'll be cross when he finds
the children missing.Put these away. The cause
infuriates Mr Banks.I beseech you, please reconsider.Think of the children.Think of Mr Banks. He was
just getting used to you.Posts, everyone!4, 3, 2, 1...Fire!- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.Bit early tonight, Admiral?Nonsense. Bang on
the dot, as usual.How's the world of finance?Never better.Money's sound, credit
rates are moving up,- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.How about you?Bit chancy, I'd say.The Wind's up.
The glass is falling.- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.Banks, you're steering into
a nasty piece of weather.Banks!Do you hear me?Hello, Katie Nanna. That
must be heavy. Allow me.Hmph!What a very pretty hat.<i>I feel a surge of
deep satisfaction</i><i>Much as a king astride
his noble steed</i>Thank you.<i>When I return from daily
strife to hearth and wife</i><i>How pleasant is the life I lead</i>- Dear, the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.<i>I run my home precisely on schedule</i><i>At 6:01, I march through my door</i><i>My slippers, sherry, and
pipe are due at 6:02</i><i>Consistent is the life I lead</i>George, they're missing.Splendid, splendid.<i>It's grand to be an
Englishman in 1910</i><i>King Edward's on the
throne It's the age of men</i><i>I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege</i><i>I treat my subjects
servants, children, wife</i><i>With a firm, but gentle
hand Noblesse oblige</i><i>It's 6:03, and the heirs to my
dominion are scrubbed and tubbed</i><i>And adequately fed</i><i>And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed</i><i>Ah, lordly is the life I lead</i>Winifred, where are the children?They're not here, dear.Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?- I don't know.
- You don't know?They're missing. Katie Nanna
has looked everywhere.Very well. I'll deal
with this at once.The police station.
Quickly, please.We needn't bother
the police. The fact is...Facts cloud the issue.One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...Oh.- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.George Banks here.17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.Please send a policeman.The policeman's here, George.What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.Thank you so much. Good night.Come in, constable.While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?Come along now.Jane.Michael.Winifred, don't be emotional.I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.Children, come here at once.Well?- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...And the kite was too strong.The kite ran away,
sir, not the children.Thank you. I'll manage this.It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.Perhaps if you helped us...That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.Only last week...I'm very grateful
to you, constable.The cook will find you
a plate of something.I shall now return to my duties.Thank you, constable.Good night, miss. Good night,
ma'am. Good night, sir."Cook will find something."I'm awfully sorry
about this, George.You'll want to discuss it.I would, indeed.Ellen, take the children upstairs.Yes, sir.I knew it.Who bears the brunt of everything?Me, that's who.They don't want an honest
working girl here.They need a ruddy zoo keeper.Sorry.When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.She looked solemn, cross.Never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.I'll do better next time.Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.I quite agree.Choosing a nanny is
a delicate task,requiring insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.Under the circumstances,it might be apropos to select
the next person myself.Would you, George?I'll do this properly.I'll advertise in The Times.- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.Wanted... No, required...Nanny.Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.<i>A British nanny must be a general</i><i>The future empire
lies within her hands</i><i>And so the person that we
need to mould the breed</i><i>It is a nanny who can give commands</i>- Getting this, Winifred?
- Yes, every word.<i>A British bank is
run with precision</i><i>A British home
requires nothing less</i><i>Tradition, discipline, and
rules must be the tools</i><i>Without them disorder,
catastrophe, anarchy</i><i>In short, you have a ghastly mess</i>Splendid, George. Inspirational.
<i>The Times</i> will be so pleased.- Father.
- Yes?We've discussed everything,
and we're very sorry about today.I should think so.- It was wrong.
- Indeed.We'll cooperate with the new nanny.I'll be glad for your help.That's why we wrote
this advertisement.Advertisement for what?The new nanny.- You wrote an...
- George, let's listen.You wanted our help.Oh, very well."Wanted, a nanny for
two adorable children.""Adorable." That's
debatable, I must say.<i>"If you want this choice position</i><i>"Have a cheery disposition"</i>Jane, I don't...<i>"Rosy cheeks, no warts</i>I wrote that.<i>"Play games, all sorts</i><i>"You must be kind</i><i>"You must be witty</i><i>"Very sweet and fairly pretty"</i>- That's...
- George, please.<i>"Take us on outings, give us treats</i><i>"Sing songs, bring sweets</i><i>"Never be cross or cruel</i><i>"Never give us castor oil or gruel</i><i>"Love us as a son and daughter</i><i>"And never smell of barley water"</i>I wrote that, too.<i>"If you won't scold and dominate us</i><i>"We will never give
you cause to hate us</i><i>"We won't hide your
spectacles so you can't see</i><i>"Put toads in your bed
or pepper in your tea</i><i>"Hurry, nanny</i><i>"Many thanks</i><i>"Sincerely</i><i>"Jane and Michael Banks"</i>Thank you. Most interesting.
We've had enough of this.Please return to the nursery.- They were only trying to help.
- I'm aware of that.I congratulate myself
on stepping in."Play games, sing songs,
give treats." Ridiculous.No question in my mind.
Now is the time for action.The Times, please.I don't know the number.Oh, George, you're
always so forceful.<i>The Times?</i> George
Banks, Cherry Tree Lane.I wish to place an advertisement.- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.Wind's coming from a new quarter.So it is.- Sir.
- What?Something taking place
off the port bow.Ghastly looking crew, I must say.There's a queue of nannies outside.
Shall I show them in?I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall be.12 seconds to go.- 10, 9...
- Posts!7, 6, 5, 4,3,2,1.It is now 8:00.Yes, sir.I have told you repeatedly, Ellen,I dislike being
hurried into things.I don't understand.They're nothing like
what we advertised for.Woof! Woof! Woof!Michael, look!- Perhaps it's a witch.
- Nonsense. Witches have brooms.It's her. It's the person. She's
answered our advertisement.Rosy cheeks and everything.- Show them in, one at a time.
- Yes, sir.- Come in, one at a time.
- Thank you.You are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?I said, you are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?Yes, of course.You brought your references?I never give references.I believe it very old-fashioned.We'll see about that then.Now then, the qualifications.Item one, "A cheery disposition."I am never cross.Item two, "Rosy cheeks."Obviously.Item three,
"Play games, all sorts."They'll find my games
extremely diverting.Where did you get this paper?
I tore it up.Excuse me.Item four, "You must be kind."I am kind, but extremely firm.Have you lost something?That paper. I thought that I...You are George Banks?And you did advertise for a nanny?George Banks.Very well, then.Tore it up, turned it over,
threw it in the...Are you ill?I hope not.About my wages...- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.We must be clear on that.- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.Perhaps a trial
period would be wise.Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.I'll see the children now.Close your mouth.
We are not codfish.Don't stand there.
Best foot forward.Spit spot.George?
- Aah!I thought you were
interviewing nannies.I was, I was.You've selected one already?Yes, it's done.- Where is she?
- In the nursery.- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.I'd have muddled everything.Is she everything that
we hoped she'd be?It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...Will she be firm and give commands?Will she mould our young breed?Winifred, I think she will.I think she Will!In that case, perhaps Ellen
should dismiss the others.The others?- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?Tell the others the
position's been filled.- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.How many nannies does
this house need?The position has been filled.I'm afraid the nursery
isn't very tidy.Rather like a bear pit.- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.Your room has a lovely view.Hmm...It's not exactly
Buckingham Palace...Still, it's clean.Yes, it will be quite suitable.Just needs a touch here and there.First things first.The place to hang a hat
is on a hat stand.Oh!This will never do.I much prefer seeing all
of my face at once.But there was nothing in it.Never judge things by their
appearance, even carpetbags.I never do."A thing of beauty
is a joy forever."Hmm... A little more light perhaps.We'd better watch this one.- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.Much better.Now, let me see.That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.- What?
- My tape measure.- What for?
- To see how you measure up.That's the funniest
thing I ever saw.Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.Good.Come along, then. Quickly.Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.Just as I thought. "Extremely
stubborn and suspicious."- I am not.
- See for yourself.- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.Now you, Jane."Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."How about you?Very well. Hold this for me.As I expected."Mary Poppins, practically
perfect in every way."Mary Poppins.
Is that your name? It's lovely.I've always liked it.Shall we move?In your advertisement,
did you not request games?Yes.First we'll play
"Well Begun Is Half Done."That sounds suspicious.Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up The Nursery."I told you she was tricky.Shall we begin?It is a game, isn't it?Depends on your viewpoint.You see, in every job that must be
done, there is an element of fun.You find the fun,
and snap, the job's a game.<i>And every task you undertake</i><i>becomes a piece of cake</i><i>A lark, a spree</i><i>It's very clear to see</i><i>That a</i><i>spoonful of sugar

- Hello, Bert.You know Jane and Michael.Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?We're going to the park.To the park?Not if I know Mary Poppins.Other nannies go to the park.When you're with Mary Poppins,quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle,"the most unusual things happen.What are you talking about?It's not my place to say,but she probably has
in mind a jolly holiday.Something along these lines.That's always good. Here we go.How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.World famous artistesperforming death-defying feats
of dexterity and skill.Ta-da!Ta-da!Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.A typical English countryside
done by a loving hand.Though you can't see it, there's a
little country fair down that road.I don't see any road.What? No road?Just wants a bit of something hereand a bit of something there.There.A country road suitable for
travel and high adventure.May we go, Mary Poppins, please?Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?Now's the time. No one's looking.Oh, please. Please.I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself.All right. I'll do it myself.Do what?Bit of magic.- Magic?
- It's easy.Let's see.You think.You wink.You do a double blink.You close your eyes and jump.Is something supposed to happen?Bert, what utter nonsense.Oh.Why do you complicate things?Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.1, 2...Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.You look fine, too, Bert.Isn't there a fair?Down the road and behind the hill.I hear the merry-go-round.- Tell them hello.

- Morning.Mary Poppins taught us...<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>What are you talking about?
Supercali...Whatever it is.It's something to say when
you don't know what to say.Yes, well, I always
know what to say.- Yes, hurry along, please.
- Yes, Father.<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>Winifred, will you explain
this unseemly hullabaloo?I don't think there's
anything to explain.The children just came in
to make you feel better.I should like to be quite clear.I am not out of sorts. I'm
in a perfectly equable mood.I do not require being
made to feel better!You're always saying you want a
cheerful and pleasant household.I should like to make a differentiation
between cheerful and...Excuse me, dear.Posts, everyone, please!I have no objection
to cheerfulness.I expect certain decorum.I don't propose standing idly byand letting Poppins
undermine the discipline...There's something extremely
odd about this householdsince that woman arrived,
and I've noticed it.Yes, dear.One thing more.Yes, dear?Have this piano repaired.I like to have it in tune.But, George, you don't play.That is entirely beside the point!Now, let me see.We must go to the piano tuners,then to Mrs Cory's shop
for some gingerbread,then to the fishmonger's
for dover sole and prawns.Michael, stop stravaging
along behind.Ahoy, there!Ahoy!- Good day to you.
- Good morning, Admiral.What fine adventure are
we off upon today?Going to fight the Hottentots?Dig for buried treasure?We're going to buy fish.Very good. Proceed at flank speed.Aye, aye, sir.Let's put our backs into it.More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted.Andrew.Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof!Slow down. I can't
understand a word.Woof! Woof! Woof!Again?The poor man.Woof! Woof! Woof!Woof! Ah-choo!Bless you.Woof! Woof! Woof!Why, yes, certainly.
I'll go straight-away.- Thank you very much.
- Woof!- What did he say?
- "You're welcome."- And?
- He didn't say anything.You know best.I thought we were buying fish.There's been a change of plans.Come along, please.
Don't straggle.Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.You should go home and rest.Woof!- Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came right away.How is he?He's never been worse.How about them?
It's contagious, you know.- We'll get spots?
- Unlikely.Ohh! Hoo hoo hoo!Oh, Uncle Albert.Bless my soul.It's Mary Poppins.
I'm delight... Ha-ha!I'm delighted to see you.Uncle Albert, you promised.Ha-ha! I know.I tried, really, I did. I... Ho ho!But I so enjoy laughing. Ah ha ha!When I start, it's up with...
Ha ha ha!That's what happens.I love to laugh! Ah ho ho!Oh, my! I can't help it.Ha ha ha!I just like laughing.Ha ha! Ha ha!Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.Last time, we took three
days to get him down.<i>I love to laugh</i>Hoo hoo hoo hoo!<i>Loud and long and clear</i>Ha!<i>I love to laugh</i>Ha ha ha ha!<i>It's getting worse every year</i>Ha ha ha!<i>The more I laugh</i>Ho ho ho!<i>The more I fill with glee</i>You're no help!<i>The more the glee</i>Ha ha ha ha!<i>The more I'm a merrier me</i>Hoo hoo hoo!It's embarrassing.<i>The more I'm a merrier me</i>Ha ha ha ha ha ha!Ha ha ha ha!<i>Some people laugh
through their noses</i><i>Sounding something like this</i>Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!Dreadful.Sss-sss-sss!<i>Some people laugh through
their teeth Goodness sakes</i><i>Hissing and fizzing like snakes</i>Sss sss sss!Not at all attractive.<i>Some laugh too fast</i>Hee hee hee hee!<i>Some only blast</i>Ha!<i>Others they twitter like birds</i>Hee hee hee hoo! Hee hee hee hoo!You're as bad as he is.<i>Then there's that kind what
can't make up their mind</i>Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!Hee hee hee, ho ho ho!Hee ha ho huh?<i>When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside</i><i>And squeak, hee,
as the squeakelers do</i>Ha ha ha!<i>I've got to let go</i><i>With a ho ho ho ho</i>Ha ha ha ha!<i>And a ho ho ho, hoo!</i>How nice!I was hoping you'd turn up.We always have a jolly time.<i>We love to laugh</i>Ha ha ha ha!<i>Loud and long and clear</i>Hoo hoo hoo!<i>We love to laugh</i>Ha ha ha ha!<i>So everybody can hear</i>Ha ha ha!<i>The more you laugh</i>Don't you start. Come back here.<i>We fill With glee</i>Hee hee hee!<i>And the more the glee</i>Ha ha ha ha!<i>The more we're a merrier we</i>Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.Pull up a chair.I say, you're a sight.Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.He works in a watch factory.What's he do?He stands about all
day and makes faces.Makes faces in a watch factory!You made that up.That's good.Such behaviour.It's disgraceful or my
name isn't Mary Poppins.I know a man with a
wooden leg named Smith.What's the name of his other leg?Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...Children, it's tea time. I won't
have schedule interruptions.Please stay.Look, I have tea ready for you.And it's getting cold.I had hoped that maybe you would...Splendid! Thank you very much.Mind the bread and butter.Now watch, children.I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.I suppose you'll want me to pour.If I must, I must.But stop behaving
like laughing hyenas.- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.- Bed?
- None for me.I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.Pour some milk for
Michael and yourself.- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.The other day when it was cold,
a friend bought long underwear.The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"My friend said,
"From September to March."Jane! Control yourself!Children, please sit up properly.- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.I'm having fun.I wish you could always stay here.We'll have to. There's no way down.Oh, there is a way.I hate mentioning it because you
must think of something sad.Do it, please.Let me see.I've got the very thing.Yesterday, when my neighbour
answered the bell, a man was there.The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.Then he said,
"I'll replace your cat."She said, "Okay,
but can you catch mice?"I started out saying...I try. Really, I do.But everything ends
up so hilarious. I can't...I can't help...That will be enough of that.It's time to go home.Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.That's the saddest
thing I ever heard.Come along, children.Must you really go?People come to see me all the time,
and we have such a lovely time.Then they go home,
and I'm very, very sad about it.Don't worry. We'll return soon.It was lovely.- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.Thank you.Uncle Albert,I got a jolly joke I saved
for just such an occasion.- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.Righto. It's about me granddad.One night, he had a nightmare.So scared he chewed
his pillow to bits.Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"He says,
"A little down in the mouth."There's nothing like a good joke.No, and that's nothing
like a good joke.Bit late tonight, aren't you?I say, Banks!Is anything the matter, Banks?Banks!We're so glad you're home!We had the most
wonderful afternoon.I know a man with a
wooden leg named Smith.We don't know anyone called Smith.The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"And a party on the ceiling.Children, be quiet.Mary Poppins says we'll go again.Oh?Oh, Mary Poppins said that?Please return to your room.Mary Poppins,
will you come with me?As you wish.Mary Poppins, I regret
what I must say.Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?I'm afraid so.I have to dress for my rally.- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.Mary Poppins, I confess
I'm disappointed in you.She's for it.
I've heard this before.I don't deny I'm
partially responsiblefor allowing the children's
worthless frivolity.But they must learn the
seriousness of life.But they're only children.In light of what's happened...George, are you certain?I believe I am.<i>A British bank is
run with precision</i><i>A British home
requires nothing less</i><i>Tradition, discipline, and
rules must be the tools</i><i>Without them disorder,
chaos, moral disintegration</i><i>In short, you have a ghastly mess</i>I quite agree.<i>The children must be
moulded, shaped and taught</i><i>That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought</i>I'm disturbed to hear my children
talking about popping into pictures,consorting with racehorse
persons, fox hunting...I don't mind that. It's tradition.But parties on the ceiling?Having tea parties on the ceiling?And other highly
questionable outings...<i>If they must go on outings</i><i>These outings ought to be fraught
with purpose, yes, and practicality</i><i>These silly words like</i>Superca...Super...Supercal...Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.Yes, well done.<i>And popping through pictures have
little use, fulfill no basic need</i><i>They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth</i><i>They must learn</i><i>About the life you lead</i>Exactly.<i>They must feel the thrill of
totting up a balanced book</i><i>A thousand ciphers neatly in a row</i>Quite right.<i>When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up</i><i>Their little cup of joy
should overflow</i>Precisely.<i>It's time they learnt to
walk in your footsteps</i>My footsteps.<i>To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride</i>With pride.<i>Tomorrow, just as you suggest</i><i>Pressed and dressed Jane
and Michael will be at your side</i>Splendid! You've hit the nail...At my side? Where are we going?To the bank.- The bank?
- Yes.Tomorrow's an important day.I'll see they have a
proper night's sleep.Did I say I'd take the
children to the bank?It sounded that way.And why not?Capital idea.Just the medicine they need for all this
sugary female thinking they get here.Quite right. Good idea.Quite right.Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.What do you mean?Weren't you sacked?Sacked? I am never sacked.- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!Neither am I a maypole.- But...
- Goats butt.Birds fly.Children going out with their
father get some sleep.An outing with Father?He's never taken us on an outing.He's never taken us anywhere.How did you manage it?You gave him the idea.How impertinent!Me giving ideas to people? Really.- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.Michael, the city! Father
can point out the sights.Most things he can.Sometimes people, through no fault of
their own, can't see past their nose.Past their nose?Yes. Sometimes a little
thing is quite important.Oh, look. The cathedral.Father passes that every day.<i>Early each day to the
steps of St. Paul's</i><i>The little old bird woman comes</i><i>In her own special way
to the people she calls</i><i>Come buy my bags full of crumbs</i><i>Come feed the little birds</i><i>Show them you care</i><i>And you'll be glad if you do</i><i>Their young ones are hungry</i><i>Their nests are so bare</i><i>All it takes is tuppence</i><i>From you</i><i>Feed the birds</i><i>Tuppence a bag</i><i>Tuppence, tuppence</i><i>Tuppence a bag</i><i>Feed the birds</i><i>That's what she cries</i><i>While overhead,
her birds fill the skies</i><i>All around the cathedral</i><i>The saints and apostles</i><i>Look down as she sells her wares</i><i>Although you can't see it</i><i>You know they are smiling</i><i>Each time someone shows</i><i>That he cares</i><i>Though her words are simple and few</i><i>Listen, listen</i><i>She's calling to you</i><i>Feed the birds</i><i>Tuppence a bag</i><i>Tuppence, tuppence</i><i>Tuppence a bag</i><i>Though her words are simple and few</i><i>Listen, listen</i><i>She's calling to you</i><i>Feed the birds</i><i>Tuppence a bag</i><i>Tuppence</i><i>Tuppence</i><i>Tuppence a bag</i>Now, remember. Be on
your best behaviour.Isn't it your bank?As a younger officer,
it is, sort of.Michael, look.It's her!- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.Just like Mary Poppins said.You see her?Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?Listen, she's saying it.Feed the birds.Tuppence a bag.Of course she's saying it.- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.But Mary Poppins...I'm not interested in Mary
Poppins nor in hearing her name.But it's my tuppence.Michael, don't throw
your money away!At the bank, I'll show
you what to do.It's extremely interesting.Hello, Banks.
What's all this about?My children.Why are they here?They're opening an account, sir.How much money do you have?Tuppence. I want it
to feed the birds.Tuppence!Tuppence...Precisely how I started.That's the elder Mr Dawes,
a giant in the finance world.A giant?Father, these are Banks' children!They want to open an account!Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.We can use more money to
put to work for the bank.You have tuppence?May I be permitted to see it?It's for feeding the birds.Feed the birds and
what have you got?Fat birds!But...<i>If you invest your
tuppence wisely in the bank</i><i>Safe and sound</i><i>Soon that tuppence</i><i>Safely invested in the bank</i><i>Will compound</i><i>And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest</i><i>As your affluence expands</i><i>In the hands of the directors</i><i>Who invest</i><i>As propriety demands</i>- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.You see, Michael, you'll be part
of railways through Africa!Exactly.Dams across the Nile.- Talk about the ships.

I'm a chimney sweep.Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.Don't take on so.Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.Who's after you?Father.What?We went to his bank.We must have done
something dreadful.The police and army were after us.Michael, don't exaggerate.There must be some mistake.Your dad loves you.No, not with the look
he had on his face.He doesn't like us.That don't seem likely, does it?It's true.Let's sit down.Begging your pardon,but my heart goes
out to your father.There he is in that cold,
heartless bank,hemmed in by mounds of
cold, heartless money.I don't like seeing
living things caged up.Father in a cage?Cages come in all sizes and shapes,even bank-shaped.Father's not in trouble, we are.Sure about that, are you?You've got your mother
to look after you,and Mary Poppins and
Constable Jones and me.Who looks after your father?When something happens,
what does he do?Fends for himself, he does.Who does he tell?No one.Don't blab his troubles.He pushes on at his job,uncomplaining, alone, and silent.He's not very silent.Michael, be quiet.Bert, does Father
really need our help?It's not my place to say.But fathers can always
do with a bit of help.I'll take you home.<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy

everything all right?Thank you.Come in!Take your hat off, Banks.Good evening, gentlemen.Get on with it. Go on.Yes, Father.In 1773, an official of this bankunwisely loaned a
large sum of moneyto finance a shipment of teato the American colonies.Do you know what happened?I do. As the ship lay
in Boston Harbour,colonists dressed as Red Indiansboarded, behaved rudely,and threw the tea overboard.This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking,even for Americans.Precisely.The loan was defaulted.Panic ensued within these walls.There was a run on the bank.From that time to this,there has not been
a run on this bank.Until today!A run, sir, caused by
the disgraceful conductof your son.Do you deny it?No, sir.I shall gladly assume
responsibility for my son.Why are you waiting?Get on with it.Yes, Father.No, not that!Steady on.Do you have anything to say?Sir, they do saythat when there's nothing to say,all you can say...Confound it, Banks!Do you have anything to say?Just one word, sir.Yes?Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.What?Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.Mary Poppins was right.It does make you feel better.There's no such word.It is a perfectly good word.Do you know what there's
no such thing as?With due respect, there's
no such thing as you!Impertinence, sir!Would you like to hear
a marvellous joke?A real snapper.Joke? Snapper?Jane and Michael meet
one day on the street.Jane says, "I know a man with
a wooden leg named Smith."Michael says, "What's the
name of his other leg?"The man's gone mad.
Call the guard!Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.I'm feeling better!Don't strike my father!There's the tuppence,
the wonderful, fateful,supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
tuppence.Guard it well. Good-bye!Where are you going?I might pop through a
chalk pavement pictureor seize a horse off

I said goodbye to?That's right. George W. Banks,17 Cherry Tree Lane.About 6'1", I'd say.Yes, we rang up his
bank first thing.We discovered he'd been
discharged last night.No telling what he'll do
in a fit of despondency.Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.There's a spot popular
with jumpers.Really, Ellen!He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman.No hanky-panky.Regular habits,
as far as anyone knows.<i>The medicine go down</i><i>Just a spoonful...</i>It's him!Or something similar.A little less noise
on the premises.I can't understand the inspector.<i>Just a spoonful of sugar</i><i>Makes the medicine go down</i>You didn't jump in the river.How sensible of you.It's all right, sir.He's been found.No, alive,or so I presume.He's kissing Mrs Banks.What happened at the bank?I've been sacked,
flung into the street.<i>A spoonful of sugar</i><i>Makes the medicine go down</i>Gone off his crumpet,
that's what he's done.Dotty as you please.What were you doing in the cellar?First, where are the children?Jane! Michael!Your father's calling.It doesn't sound like Father.Jane! Michael!Run along. Spit spot.You won't go,
Mary Poppins, will you?Spit Spot.He mended it!It's wonderful!However did you manage it?<i>With tuppence for
paper and strings</i><i>You can have your own set of wings</i><i>With your feet on the ground</i><i>You're a bird in flight</i><i>With your fist holding tight</i><i>To the string of your kite</i><i>Oh, oh, oh</i><i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>Up to the highest height</i><i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>And send it soaring</i><i>Up through the atmosphere</i><i>Up where the air is clear</i><i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>A proper kite needs a proper tail.That's what I said.Go fly a kite.No, sir. I don't
mean you personally.<i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>Up to the highest height</i><i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>And send it soaring</i><i>Up through the atmosphere</i><i>Up where the air is clear</i><i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i><i>When you send it flying up there</i><i>All at once you're lighter than air</i><i>You can dance on the breeze</i><i>Over houses and trees</i><i>With your fist holding tight</i><i>To the string of your kite</i><i>Oh, oh, oh</i><i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>Up to the highest height</i><i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>And send it soaring</i>There you are, Banks.Congratulations.Capital bit of humour."Wooden leg named Smith,"or Jones, whatever it was.Father died laughing.Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.Nonsense. Nothing
to be sorry about.Never seen him happier.He left an opening
for a new partner.Congratulations.Thank you very much indeed, sir.<i>Up through the atmosphere</i><i>Up where the air is clear</i><i>Oh, let's go</i><i>Fly a kite</i>Awk! That's gratitude for you.Didn't even say goodbye.No, they didn't.Look at them.They think more of their
father than of you.That's as it should be.Don't you care?Practically perfect people
never permit sentimentto muddle their thinking.Is that so?Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.Really?Really. I know how you feel.If you think I'm keeping
my mouth shut...That will be quite
enough, thank you.Goodbye, Mary Poppins.Don't stay away too long.<i>Oh, oh, oh</i><i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>Up to the highest height</i><i>Let's go fly a kite</i><i>And send it soaring</i><i>Up through the atmosphere</i><i>Up where the air is clear</i><i>Oh, let's go</i><i>Fly a kite</i>Preuzeto sa www.titlovi.com

- Hm?I'm listening."And even Stigand,
the Archbishop of Canterbury,agreed to meet with William
and offer him the crown. "-
- "William's conduct at first was... "Alice.Will you kindly pay attention
to your history lesson.I'm sorry. But how can one
possibly pay attentionto a book with no pictures in it?My dear child, there are many good books
in this world without pictures.In this world, perhaps.But in my world the books
would be nothing but pictures.Your world? What nonsense.- Nonsense?
- Once more, from the beginning.That's it, Dinah.If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.Nothing would be what it is because
everything would be what it isn't.And, contrariwise,
what it is, it wouldn't be.And what it wouldn't be, it would.
You see?In my world, you wouldn't say "meow".- You'd say, "Yes, Miss Alice. "
-But you would.
You'd be just like people, Dinah.And all the other animals, too.In my world...âª Cats and rabbits would reside

a rabbit possibly be late for?Please, sir.I'm late, I'm late
for a very important date.No time to say hello, goodbye.
I'm late, late, late.It must be awfully important,
like a party or something.Mr. Rabbit. Wait!No, no, no, I'm overdue.
I'm really in a stew.No time to say goodbye, hello.
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.My. What a peculiar place
to have a party.You know, Dinah,
we really shouldn't... be doing this.After all,
we haven't been invited...and curiosity often leads to trouble.|Goodbye, Dinah. Goodbye!Oh...Well, after this I shall think nothing
of... of falling down stairs.Oh!Goodness. What if I should fall
right through the centre of the Earth...and come out the other side
where people walk upside down?But that's silly. Nobody...Oh!Mr. Rabbit. Wait. Please.Curiouser and curiouser.- Ow.
-I beg your pardon.Quite all right,
but you did give me quite a turn.- I was following...
- Rather good, what? Door knob, turn.- Please, sir.
- One good turn deserves another.- What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for a white rabbit.- So, if you don't mind...
- Eh?Oh.There he is. I simply must get through.Sorry. You're much too big.
Simply impassable.- You mean impossible.
- No, impassable. Nothing's impossible.- Try the bottle on the table.

directed in the right direction."Drink me. " Hm.Better look first, for if one drinks

-You almost went out like a candle.But look. I'm just the right size.No use.
I forgot to tell you. I'm locked.Oh, no.- But, of course, you've got the key.
- What key?Don't tell me you've left it up there.Oh, dear.- Whatever will I do?

Have you dry in no time now.No one can ever get dry this way.Nonsense. I'm as dry as a bone already.- Yes, but...

-If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.If you think we're alive,
you ought to speak to us.- That's logic.
- Well...It's been nice meeting you. Goodbye.- You're beginning backwards.
- First thing in a visit is to say...âª How do you do and shake hands,
shake hands, shake handsâª How do you do and shake hands,

- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?- Or Button? Who's got the button?
- No, thank you.If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.That's very kind of you,

- Because I'm following a white rabbit.- Why?
- I'm curious to know where he's going.Oh, she's curious.The oysters were curious, too,
weren't they?Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.Poor things.Why? What did happen to the oysters?- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.

would be a sheer delightAnd should we get hungry on the way,
we'll stop and have a biteBut Mother Oyster winked her eye

Very good indeed.Now, if you're ready, oysters, dear,we can begin the feed.-  Feed?
- Oh yes.The time has come, my little friends,

- Do you suppose she's a wild flower?No, I'm not a wild flower.Just what specie or shall we say genus
are you, my dear?Well, I suppose you'd call me
a genus humanus Alice.Ever see an Alice
with a blossom like that?Come to think of it,
did you ever see an Alice?And did you notice her petals?What a peculiar color.And no fragrance.- Just look at those stems.
- Rather scrawny, I'd say.- I think she's pretty.
- Quiet, Bud.- But I'm not a flower.
- Ah-ha! Just as I suspected.She's nothing
but a common mobile vulgaris.Oh, no!- A common what?
- To put it bluntly, a weed.I'm not a weed.- You wouldn't expect her to admit it.
- Can you imagine?- Well, goodness.
- Don't let her stay and go to seed.- Go on.
- Please go.- We don't want weeds in our bed.
- Move along.All right. If that's the way
you feel about it.If I were my right size, I could pick
every one of you if I wanted to.And I guess that'd teach you.You can learn a lot of things
from the flowers.Seems to me they could learn
a few things about manners.âª A, E, I, O, Uâª O, U, E, I, O, Aâª U, E, I, Aâª A, E, I, O, U âªWho are you?Well, I... I hardly know, sir.I've changed so many times, you see.I do not see.- Explain yourself.
- I'm afraid I can't explain myself.- Because I'm not myself, you know.
- I do not know.I can't put it any more clearly,
for it isn't clear to me.You? Who are you?Well, don't you think
you ought to tell me...... who you are first?Why?Oh, dear. Everything is so confusing.- It is not.
-  Well it is to me.- Why?
- I can't remember things as I used to.Recite.Hmm? Oh, yes, sir. Erm...How doth the little busy bee
improve each...Stop!That is not spoken correcitally.
It goes:How...How doth the little crocodile
improve his shining tailAnd pour the waters of the Nile
on every golden scale?How cheer...How cheerfully he seems to grinHow neatly spreads his clawsAnd welcomes little fishes inWith gently smiling jaws.I've never heard it that way before.I know. I have improved it.Well...- If you ask me...
- You?Who are you?You, there. Girl.Wait. Come back.I have something important to say.Oh, dear.I wonder what he wants now.Well?Keep your temper.- Is that all?
- No.Exatically what is your problem?It's exatically... exat...
It's precisely this.I should like to be

I have a few more helpful hints.- One side will make you grow taller.
- One side of what?And the other side
will make you grow shorter.- The other side of what?
- The mushroom, of course!Hmm.One side will make me grow...But which is which?After all that's happened,
I... I wonder if I...I don't care.I'm tired of being
only three inches high.A serpent!Help! Serpent! Serpent!- But, please, please.
- Off with you. Shoo. Go away. Serpent!Serpent!But I'm not a serpent.Indeed? Then just what are you?- I'm just a little girl.
- Little? Little?!Well, I am. I mean, I was.And I suppose
you don't eat eggs, either.- Yes, I do.
- I knew it. I knew it.Serpent. Serpent!For goodness' sake.Hmm.- And the other side will...
- The very idea.Spend all my time laying eggs
for serpents like her.Goodness. I wonder
if I'll ever get the knack of it.There. That's much better.Better save these.Let's see. Where was I?I wonder which way I ought to go.âª 'Twas brillig and the slithy tovesâª Did gyre and gimble in the wabeâª All mimsy were the borogovesâª And the mome raths outgrabeWhere in the world

I mean... Oh, dear.Can you stand on your head?However, if I were looking

But I did enjoy your singing.- I wonder if you could tell me...
- You enjoyed our singing?Oh, what a delightful child.I'm so excited.

more than nothing.- But I only meant that...
- And now, my dear...Something seems to be troubling you.- Won't you tell us all about it?
- Start at the beginning.Yes.And when you come to the end, ... stop.
See?Well, it all started while I was sitting
on the river bank with Dinah.Very interesting.Who's Dinah?Dinah's my cat. You see...Cat?!Get the jam. Put it on his nose.On his nose.My goodness.
Those are the things that upset me.See all the trouble you've started?- I didn't think that...

Don't you care for tea?Yes, I'm very fond of tea, but...You could at least
make polite conversation.I've been trying to ask you...I have an excellent idea.Let's change the subject.Why is a raven like a writing desk?Riddles? Let me see, now.Why is a raven like a writing desk?- I beg your pardon?

- I'm so late, I'm so very, very late.Well, no wonder you're late.
This clock is exactly two days slow.- Two days slow?
- Course you're late.My goodness.
We'll have to look into this.Ah-ha. I see what's wrong with it.
This watch is full of wheels.Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels and springs.- But, but, but...
- Butter, of course.It needs some butter. Butter!- Butter!
- Butter?Thank you. Butter. That's fine.No, no, no. You'll get crumbs in it.Oh, this is the very best butter.
What are you talking about?- Tea?

- Oh, I beg your pardon.Goodness. When I get home,
I shall write a book about this place.If I... If I ever do get home.Oh, erm... excuse me.- Could one of you tell me... ?
-Never mind.Oh, dear. It's getting dreadfully dark.And nothing looks familiar.I shall certainly be glad
to get out of...It would be so nice if something
would make sense for a change.Oh!"Don't step on the mome raths. "The mome raths?A path! Oh, thank goodness.I just knew I'd find one
sooner or later.If I hurry, perhaps I might even
be home in time for tea.Won't Dinah be happy to see me!I just can't wait till I...Oh, dear.Now I shall never get out.Well, when one's lost,I... I suppose it's good adviceto stay where you are

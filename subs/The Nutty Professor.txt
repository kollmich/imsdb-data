Miss Lemmon! Miss Lemmon!Oh. Well. Oh! Dr. Warfield.Miss Lemmon, get Professor Kelp
in here immediately.But Dr. Warfield, I think that
Professor Kelp has a class right now.He had a class. Can't you hear?
Now, get him!Get the axe. Get the axe.All right, men. All together, the door.Look out! Look out! Look out!Oh. Oh, for... I beg your pardon. Oh.Oh, this is terrible. Oh.Oh.Oh, my. Oh.Oh, my.Professor Kelp?Are you all right?And if you are, where are you all right?Oh.Oh, my.Oh, oh, oh.Oh, Dr. Warfield wants
to see you in his office.- Dr. Warfield wants...
- Yes, right away.I used too much...Kelp.How long have you been on
the faculty of this university?Oh, well, I would say......oh, prior to my exposureas a student counselor
at USC, three years...No, I went to postgrad, naturally.
That was two years prior...No, there was a botany exposure
that I had in one particular school.I had decided premed,
botany, whatever.I would much prefer the sciences,
in other words.I think I should really go back to
the time that I graduated college...How long?Two years and 22 minutes now.Kelp, as I recall
upon your arrival here,I told you, along with the other
new members of the faculty,that I will not standfor any member of my staff utilizing
the facilities of this universityfor his or her own
personal experiments.Did I not make myself perfectly clear?Good. I knew my memory
served me well.And Kelp, wasn't it approximately
six weeks laterthat you conducted a rather interesting
little experiment before your class?Let me see. I think it had something
to do with an additive to gasolinefor the purpose of
increasing the efficiencyof the combustion engine. Right?Yes, it was something
to that effect, Dr. Warfield.And do you happen to recall
what that additive was?Yes, as a matter of fact,
now that you bring it up,the additive was, specifically,three parts carbon,
five parts hydrogen,one part nitrogen
and three parts oxygen.- Which, of course, is?
- Nitroglycerin.- The results were?
- Negative.- And?
- Noisy?Noisy?It was the worst explosion in the
history of this or any other university.Kelp, that was two years ago,and they're still talking about
it on the campus today.Now that you mention that,
Dr. Warfield,I saw young Phips the other day.You recall Arnold Phips
was in my class that day.Oh, yes. Really?
What'd he have to say?Well, he said he's feeling much better,and that the bandages should
be off in about two weeks.Oh, well, a couple... Exactly!
That's exactly what I mean.You are a menace.Professor Kelp.Believe me, I know
what I'm talking about. Kelp,it's human nature. Kelp,people just don't like teachers
blowing up their kids!Kelp, try to understand
that I understand......that scientists and creators
have their little eccentricities.Einstein hated haircuts.Da Vinci loved to paint. And Newton?He had something to do
with figs, didn't he?So therefore, I, too, realizethat you have many of these
same eccentricities.Try leaving them in the locker when
you come in in the morning, professor.And by all means, feel free
to take them home with you at night.All right, Kelp.Simmer down and relax.I'm sure that we won't have to have
another little talk like this again.Am I correct in assuming this?Oh, without question,
you're absolutely...Yes, we'll never have
to correct our talk.We won't ever speak... That is,
we'll never have to talk again.We just never will discuss talking.We shouldn't really converse
about speaking.Professor, our discussion has
come to an end.Oh, thank you very much, doctor.- Kelp?
- Yes.Your watch. Does it......always?Oh, well, no, just...
Just when I open...Those are your greens.Fine. How are you?"Therefore, through history,"man has been curious..."- Professor Kelp?
- Yes, Worfshefski.- I... I have to go...
- You have to go?And since when did you find it
necessary to ask permission to go?No, well, what I meant to say,
Professor Kelp, was thatI have to go to football practice.Football practice?At this hour?
What about your studies?Well, Mr. Coughman, the coach,well, he asked me to try and get off
my first class this morning because...Get off your first class?Did he now? To get off your
first class. Mr. Worfshefski,had you learned anything
in your first class,and I am in reference
to the elementary class,you might not be in such
dire need of learning now.Your request is denied.Please be good enough to sit down,and I don't want to hear another word
about your stupid practice.You didn't have no call to go yelling
at me like that, Professor Kelp.Worfshefski, I might have been
a little rash.And that wasn't very nice when you
said that my practice was stupid.No, I might have meant
that I was stupidin assuming that practice was stupid.- Naughty, naughty, naughty...
- Now, Worfshef......teacher.
- Well, no, you shouldn't be upset.Worfshefski, you're breaking my...
Oh, there goes the tibia.Worfshefski, you're a... Worfshefski.You must realize that...
You must realize what you're do...You don't realize what
you're doing, Worfshefski.Really. Worfshefski, you don't
realize what you're doing.Well, just don't do something,
sit there.Well, that is... Class dismissed.You may go.Can I be of any assistance,
Professor Kelp?Oh...Thank you, Miss Purdy.You're very, very considerate.Actually, I would appreciate
the assistance,for were it not for your assisting me,I might very well be here
all semester.Well...- Let's start with the book.
- Yeah, that... I don't...Oh, I...You have to be...Wait, it's connected.
You better not press that.Just pull it right out, Miss Purdy.
Oh. That really snapped.- Oh, I'm sorry, professor.
- That's all right. Just...- No, try and lean...
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.No, let me just...Let me have this arm.
Just, may I have that arm?- Oh, yes.
- All right, now you just holdsome of the body.Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Purdy.Are you all right, professor?Oh, yes, I've... This is
very embarrassing, Miss Purdy.Why don't you call me
Stella, professor.Oh, I thought it was Stella Purdy.Oh, you mean to call you Stella, yes.How stupid of me. I'm sorry.All right, I will, stupid... Stella.I'm very upset.
It's very embarrassing.Honestly, professor.You shouldn't let a big ox
like that bother you.He's the typical bully that loves
picking on a small man.Ye... Yes, you're right, Miss Purdy.But you had best run along,
or you'll miss your next class.You're sure you're all right?Oh, yes, I'm... As I said, I'm just
embarrassed. I'm fine. Thank you.Miss Pur...Oh!Miss Pur... Excuse me. The...<i>He's a typical bully that loves</i>
<i>picking on a small man.</i><i>Picking on a small man. Picking on</i>
<i>a small man. Picking on a small man.</i>I think I broke this...You're going the wrong way, sir.This is the gym. I take it you're new?- Well, I'm not brand-new.
- No, I mean a new student.Oh.I'm terribly sorry, sir. Are you hurt?Well, actually......if you would say that a man
with an ulcerhad a nail in his shoe
and a splinter in his finger,was then struck by lightning,if you could say that that man
was not hurt, then yes,you would say I'm not hurt.Good. By the way, we don't
wear glasses at Vic Tanny's.Oh, well, fine.
Then I'll just take these off.I didn't realize that you're
not suppose to...There's nowhere really that I have to...Is there someplace
that I could put?Would you like me to put
these in a locker for you?Well, I certainly would appreciate that.
You're very kind.I would have put them there
had I knownthat there was some
form of restriction.that there was some
form of restriction.Some people use them for a fa√ßade.
I wear them for eyes, you see."Four eyes"? It's a play on "eyes".Well, I hope I did nothing wrong
by wearing them.You see, I just didn't realize...If we could get started,
I do have a class,and I do have to get going.- Come along with me.
- Wonderful.Well, I hope you understand
I've never done this before,and I don't even know
where to begin.We start right here.Oh, identical twins.No, that's a pulley machine.A... Oh, a pulley machine?
Well, what does it do?You pull it.Fifteen or 20 pulls to begin with.- Oh, I see, well...
- And take it easy.Oh, take it easy, naturally, I...
I wouldn't strain myself for the world.Well, thank you very, very much.You're welcome. Happy muscles.Yes, I certainly do.Oh, yes, I've seen that
in those magazines.Oh, that's very invigorating.Oh, that's terrific.Oh, I'm going to have a great
deal of fun with this, I can tell.The various aspects, of course,
is relativity to hydrogen.There is hydrogen,duly explosiveand more devastating than the atomic.There is equally
the devastation in nitrogen.Nitrogen equally...I... I couldn't help but notice...I was standing here...
That's amazing,the way that youpush those things up there, that...
It must take a great deal of patience.And a little muscle.Oh, yes. Well, you certainly are...
Yes, you are...I'd love to be able to... I... I would
really enjoy trying that sometime.I... I don't think you'd
have the patience for it.Oh, well, I have the other thing
you mentioned, a little muscle.I say, that was sort of a corker.Here, enjoy yourself.I... I suspect it was somewhat
heavier than I......lutely uncanny.Yes, I am inclined to agree with you,
doctor, but there area couple of specific points
that I did neglect to mention.Specifically, the day
that I went to Vic Tanny,I got on the scale, as they normally do,
you know, to check in and so on,and I weighed 153 pounds.And then after six months, I weighed
myself on that very same scale,and I found that I weighed 151.Very interesting, Professor Kelp.But I must admit,
I am somewhat surprisedat a man with your education
and backgroundto be intimidated by a bully
to this extent.Plus the fact you must know:Only some men react
to bodybuilding exercise,whereas others just don't.Come, come, professor. Revenge
can't be that important to you.No, oh, I... I must...
I must take objection there, doctor.Revenge might have
been the motivating force,but I feel now that curiosity has
taken over where revenge began.I am... I am more or less
being compelled bycompleting something that I started.I must finish what I start,
finish what I start.I can't say I don't admire a man
who likes to see something through,but if your six months have failed,
what do you propose to do now?Oh, I... I actually don't know, doctor.That's why I wanted to come
in and see you, you see.I had one plan, and I thought
I would just mention it to you.Chemistry is probably, for the
most part, what I know best.That's all I know, really, is chemistry.And some of the finest
pharmaceutical companies in the worldmake bodybuilding minerals,
vitamins, chemicals,all based on chemistry.And therefore, I felt I would approach it
from a chemistry standpoint.If I may prove a point,
I'd like to show you here...Oh, professor. Excuse me.I seem to have run out of time.I'm due at the hospital.
I hope you'll pardon me.Oh, I'm terribly sorry, doctor.
I never realized the time.As a matter of fact, I have a class.So you go right ahead
and don't worry.But I'd like to browse around
if it's all right with you.Not at all.I hope you find what you're looking for.You're terribly kind, doctor.
Thank you very much.Let's see. There should be anatomy,
body structure, structure, body, muscle."Man's growth,
physically and mentally.""The man's mind, from childhood right
through old age, never stops growing."Not in size or by measure,"but by constant learning
and knowledge.""On the other hand, man's body
does stop at a precise point,"that of completion in the structure
of the anatomy."Yet we have learned,
through chemistry..."...man can grow further with
the aid of additional elements."<i>Seven weeks and 13 experiments</i>

<i>trying it on myself tonight.</i>Tonight.Oh, I'm real... Oh, Miss Purdy.I'm terribly sorry. Here...Just let me get you up there, dear.Just... That's just ridiculous.- I never... I just swung the door...
- That's quite all right, professor....right open, dear.
Here you are, that's...- It just knocked the breath out of me.
- I hope...- That was so stupid of me.
- I'm perfectly all right. No harm done.- Oh, well, that's fine.
- Professor?By the way, did anyone remember
to invite you for tonight?Invite me?I don't think so... No. Where?Well, the class is gonna have
a midterm celebration tonightat The Purple Pit.
We'd love having you join us.Thank you, Miss Purdy, it's terribly
considerate and kind of you,and I appreciate it and all that.And I have always said
that I feel there should bea closer interrelationship between
the student and the facultybased on better learning.Yet at the same time,
I'm sure you're awarethat The Purple Pit is off-limits
to the faculty of the university.Didn't you know that, Miss Purdy?Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry, professor.But I guess the reason
it slipped my mind is thatThe Purple Pit has never been
what it's supposed to be,by reputation, anyway.You know, I, too, have heard
it's a wild, terrible place,when it's really just
a quaint little spotwhere the students can go
to talk and relaxand just generally get acquainted.And when you really get down to it,it's quite dull.Hey, Stella, couldn't you talk old Kelp
into making the scene with us?Can you imagine the professor here
in The Pit? He would break into a rash.Oh, don't be too sure.Professor Kelp's just the kind of guy
who might fool you.I bet he likes to get out
on his own a little bit.I'll bet you right now he's......probably on his way to some
secret rendezvouswith a mysterious
dark-haired female.Come in, Julius.How are you tonight, Jennifer?- How are you tonight, Julius?
- I'm just fine.I'm Julius.Now, be very, very quiet, Jennifer.We have a lot of work to do.Tonight's the big night.Be very quiet.He's got a lot of work to do.Tonight's the big night.The big night.Well, we're just about ready, Jennifer.You might be ready, Julius.But if I were you, I'd think about it.Think. Think. Better think.Better think about it.I told you, Julius.I told you, Julius.I told you, Julius.I told you...Thank you very much, sir.We know you'll be very happy.
And you look......just stunning.And we'll have your other suits
and things no later than next week.- What'll it be?
- Oh, that's no way to talk."What'll it be?"That's no way to treat a customer.
Come here.Try it like this.Pay attention. You'll feel better,
and the customers'll be happier.Try this: "What'll it be, hmm?"Try that. Come on,
we haven't got all night.Try it.What'll it be, hmm?Good! That was wonderful.Did anyone ever tell you
you couldn't sing?Nice. Make me an Alaskan Polar Bear
Heater, on the double.Come on, come on.Say, why don't you pick on somebody
your own disposition?Oh, please, Mr. Barroom Brawler......don't hurt me or anything like that.Did you say a Polar Bear Heater?No, you said it.
I said an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater.I never heard of that.- Until now.
- Until now.All right, pay attention.- Two shots of vodka.
- Two shots of vodka.- A little rum.
- Little rum.- Some bitters.
- A little bitters.And a smidgen of vinegar!A smidgen of...
Are you gonna drink this here,or are you gonna take it home
and rub it on your chest?Hey, that was terrific.Hey, did you hear that, folks?
A regular George Bernard Shaw.Good boy! And he did it all by himself.
You did it all by yourself,and nobody helped you.
That's terrific.And with your very own big mouth. Now,
if you don't want this cocktail shakerto become a part of your gums,
mix the drink, shut your mouthand pay attention! Is that clear?
Repeat after me:- I'll...
- I'll...- I'll pay...
- I'll pay...- I'll pay attention.
- I'll pay attention.All right, let's continue.- Shot of vermouth.
- A shot of vermouth.- A shot of gin.
- A little gin.- A little brandy.
- A little brandy.- Lemon peel.
- A lemon peel.- Orange peel.
- Some orange peel.Cherry.- Some more Scotch.
- Some more Scotch.Now, mix it nice.Then pour it into a tall glass.Hey, I never tried one of these.
Do you mind if I take a sip?No, go right ahead.Not bad.Hi.I don't know of any place in the worldthat's better to get to know a lovely lady
like yourself than on the dance floor.I hope you don't refuse.I'm sorry, I'm... I'm with...Hey. Now, you move along, sonny.
She is with us.Sit down, sit down.Come here, honey.
Stand up here a minute, will you?Just over there. I'll be right back.Now, we don't want any trouble,
do we?Why don't you sit like nice boys.Would you like me to go
to Dr. Warfield, my personal friend,and tell him of your bad manners?He would be very displeased.Well, cool it.And if you're real nice lads,
cute little chappies,later on, I'll let you twirl my key chain.Now, relax.It's all straight, baby.
Put your arm up there. Right there.Remember how they do that
in the movies?They walk like high-class. Go ahead,
come on, come on, come on.Dancing, nice, with hugging.
It's wonderful. Clear the floor.I know what you're thinking."Where has he been all my life?"Right?No, not exactly.And......that you're happy the way I handled
those three goons, right?Well......normally,
I would have belted them.But I didn't want to muss myself all upand have you dance
with a sloppy guy.Dig?Well, then you restrained yourself
just for little old me.I knew you'd appreciate it.I do a lot of nice things.Well, is that really the case,or is this line 27-A
for young college girls?Now, you see?You went and done it.For one of the rare times in my life
when I dig down into the soul.And you doubt my veracity.Well, that hurts.Well......it's not your veracity that I doubt.- The music stopped.
- Yeah, I heard.Hold it a second. Hold it. Hold...
Ho... Ho... Hold it.We'll make our own music,
gorgeous. Just hold it.You and you, stay.Tubby, you go rest your thumbs.
I'll drive.Sweetie, go get your lips
pressed. Split.- Will you listen?
- You listen.Sit down here, and if you listen,
you'll be thrilled.Believe you me.Sit and listen and watch.Mood is wrong. Mood is wrong!Innkeeper! Got sexy lights?Lay it on me.Better. Better.Now, watch, baby.Every move a picture.<i>That old black magic</i>

a little more of this rare talent.Now, back to your seats. Back.Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on.Back, back, back!They're nice kids. All nice.All nice kids.They have very, very good taste,
I might add.I'm glad.It would be a shame to waste
the genius of yours on the riffraff.Well, honey, I always say,if you're good, and you know it,why waste time beating
around the bush. True?And I always say that to love yourself
is the beginning of a lifelong romance.And after watching you,I know that you and you will be
very happy together.Just a minute, sweetheart.
I don't recall dismissing you.You rude, discourteous egomaniac.You're crazy about me, right?
And I can understand it.Only this morning, looking in the mirror
before shaving,I enjoyed seeing what I saw so much,
I couldn't tear myself away.Have some, baby?If I were your baby,
I'd be swinging from a tree.Oh, Stella, that's not nice.How do you know my name?Oh, well, we were introduced.No, we weren't introduced,or I would have remembered
your name.Now, just tell me how you knew mine.Oh, well, you've heard of ESP,
extrasensory perception?I'm a firm believer in ESP.Hey, buddy.
You really sang up a storm.- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.Thanks a lot.Well, you heard him.Everybody knows Buddy.- Buddy?
- Yeah.Well, is that it?Or do you find it difficult
remembering two of them?Hey, you're kooky. That was cute."Do you find it difficult
remembering two of them?"Wonderful, sweetie.
I knew you'd be a barrel of laughs.No, I don't find it difficult
remembering two of them.Buddy......Love. That's it.Buddy Love.Buddy Love?Of the Los Angeles Loves.But that's of no consequence.
What do you say we make a move?- Make a move where?
- You have a car?- Of course I have a car.
- Crazy.Let's split.Let's split what?Is it a new car?Well, maybe not brand-new.
I've driven it a whole week.Nutty. Let's go.Here you are, baby.
Take this, wipe the lipstick off,slide over here next to me,
and let's get started.We have started and finished, buster.And now, for an encore,
get an earful of the following:I'll admit you're
a very sharp-looking guy,and you certainly have
that proverbial gift of gab.And the only reason I've gone this far,
I think, is becausewhen you meet someone who is like
nothing you've ever met before,your curiosity gets stirred up.Well, mister, this is one kitten that
won't be smitten by that little old devil.So you can just turn this car
right aroundand take me right back
where you picked me up.That is, where we met.I said, wipe the lipstick off.Was it something I said?You must be deranged.Yeah, if you don't believe
in idle chatterand a lot of small talk,
yeah, I'm deranged.Or would you prefer
that I conduct myselflike the little boys you're
accustomed to dating?Now, you know darn well that nothing
delights us more than being enjoyed,appreciated or just plain liked
by someone, right?Well, you're not gonna tell me......that you're here
with me now because......I don't appeal to you.And I'm sure that you can seeI dig you pretty good too.Right?Well, isn't it easier to say so?Or would you much prefer that I used
a lot of that phony dialogueI'm sure you've heard at least
a half a dozen times before.So you see, Stell,when I tell you that you're a vibrant,
beautiful, exciting woman,you can believe me.You can bet it's the truth,because I'd have to be a complete idiot
not to want to hold you......and kiss you
and make our time togethera warm and wonderful moment
that could grow and develop......into many moments, many hours,and into something really important.Nobody ever said anything
like that to me before.Nor can I ever remembera more honest approach
to two people being together.Well, that's what I've been trying
to get you to understand.Actually, I've never had...Have... That is...What I mean is...Miss Purdy.Oh, Miss Purdy.Oh, I'm terribly sorry, professor.That's perfectly all right, Miss Purdy.
I hope I didn't wake you.I do not recall excluding you from
the other members of the classfrom taking this test, Miss Purdy.I'm terribly sorry, professor.I was just getting readyto start.Oh, we were just getting ready
to start.Splendid, splendid.
Just getting ready.All right, students,please be aware that the test papers
must go on my desk for marking.Also, please be equally aware
of tomorrow's problem,H2O plus NO2, as we did
the other day, if you recall.I'm awfully sorry, professor,
and if it would be agreeable with you,I'd like to stay after my last class
and take the test.Well, that's highly irregular,
Miss Purdy,but we... We'll probably...Are you all right, Miss Purdy?I'll know better tonight.I mean, yes, sir, I'm quite all right.Oh, fine, then...Then I'll see you tonight...That is, after your last class,
as you said, to take the test.- Yes.
- Fine.- I'll hold your paper for you.
- Thank you.You're quite welcome.Be certain that it's
after your last class,and I'll be marking
these papers accordingly.Professor!Oh, yes, Gibson.I've got that book you asked for.- Oh, thank you very much.
- My pleasure.Yeah, wonderful. Oh.Now, then......as you might very well recall,
yesterday, in discussing biology,the long legs of the beetle
and the wonderful body of the ant...No, no, that is...
What I meant to say was,the beautiful hair of the blond fish...No, actually, their...No. Their... The legs, they...Terrific-looking.<i>I am completely aware of what</i>
<i>chemistry and drugs can do</i><i>to assist and aid the body and mind.</i><i>Yet I don't really believe</i>
<i>that what has happened to me</i><i>comes strictly from chemistry.</i><i>There must be an explanation</i>
<i>for this phenomenon.</i>- Jennifer?
- Hi, sweetie.I knew I was on the right track,but I never ever figured on
anything like this.I must have hit on heredity.Yep.That's it, heredity.Let's see.Elmer?Elmer!If you're not in here
in just ten seconds,your dinner will go to your family,
the hogs!Elm!Don't you sneak up on me.I... I... I was just finishing the ironing
of your underthings......Edwina.Darling.Love?Angel?All the other nice things
I wish I could think of to call you,so you......won't hit or yell.Honey?Honey?!Don't you "honey" me, you...You artificial son of a lizard.Now, sit down!And for the third time today,make a slob of yourself
trying to find your mouth!Idiot!Can't you eat
with your mouth closed?Not until I get something in it, dearest.What was that?Nothing. Nothing. It's quite all right.You're right. You're always right.My poor da-da.My poor da-da.Well, Jennifer,if that's what's to be, then I'll be it.You know what they say, Julie, baby:<i>Que ser√° ser√°.</i>Oh, Jennifer,
you know what I'm thinking?If this formula were to fall
into the wrong hands,the consequences
could be devastating.Now, it's much, much
too complicated to memorizeand far too vitally important
to destroy.Now, the only two people
that I know that I can trustare my mother......and my father.What I should do......is mail my formula, the copy,to Mother and Father,with instructionsthat were anything to happen to me,they are to send the copy
of the formulaand my original copy to Washington.- George or Martha?
- No, Washington D...You're a silly bird......with a big mouth.- Professor Kelp.
- Yes?- I'm ready, professor.
- Oh, that's very... Yes... What?- Did you forget about my test?
- Oh, no.Actually, no. I'm terribly sorry.
I did... I had another thing.Why don't you sit down at your table,
dear, and I'll get your paper.I actually didn't really forget.I......have so many members of the......class, it's difficult to...Oh, yes, here we are.It's very difficult to...You do want me to take the test?Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Miss Purdy.Certainly, of course, it's necessary......for you to take it.- Miss Purdy.
- Yes, Professor Kelp?I was going to say, I sincerely hope
that you don't mind if I don't linger.I do have some very essential matters
that I must take care of.Certainly, Professor Kelp.
And thank you for understanding.I understand far better than you
would ever believe, honey.Miss Purdy, that is.You just go right on,
and thank you for...Julius, in the afternoon?Hiya, chicky baby.How's it going?- Fine.
- Crazy.I thought I'd visit your little land
of learning. Cute. Cute pad.What happened to you last night?
What'd you run away like that for?I thought you saw a ghost
or something.Oh, yeah. How about that?Well, that's why I stopped by.
I thought I'd lay it on you,but this ain't the place to talk.What do you say we meet later
at The Purple Pit?- We could talk better there, huh?
- Well, I don't know.You're pretty weird, you know,
and I don't want...- Ten o'clock?
- Perfect.Figures.Hey, honey, you look a little drawn.Did you find it a little difficult going
all this time without seeing me?Don't fight it.Look, I don't wanna
hang you up, honey.I see you're doing
your little test here.But don't worry about it, beautiful.
Science will do fine without you.But man needs you the most.This man. Come here.That's good for you.If you want more, call for refills.Later.Write nice.I just told you what time it is.
It's still 11:15.- Yeah, I know.
- OK, kids! You can all relax!Watch where you're going, Mac.Now that your desperate attempt
at having a good time's flunked,have no fear, Buddy's here.Let the good times roll.Hiya, baby!There's my date!That sharp-looking chick's my date.Here you are, baby.
Your prize package has arrived.Hello, stale ones.- You're pretty late, Mr. Love.
- Hold it.Hold it, baby.
You got it a little mixed-up.You're just way too early, that's all.Now, be a nice girl
and plant one over there.You'll feel better. Come on, honey.
Best things in life are free.Now, you'll have to admit
you got one of the best things.- Go ahead, lay it on me.
- You are impossible.Yeah, well, have some impossible.
Come on.See?Wasn't that worth waiting for?Now, you gotta admit that I'm not one
of the run-of-the-mill-type creepsthat hang around this joint, right?You got a good thing. Don't louse it up.Isn't it enough that you got
the swingingest and the best?You want me to be on time too?- OK. OK, you win.
- Naturally.Would you please be good enough
to tell me why you ran away last night- and left me just sitting there?
- Hey, hey, hey, don't get all riled up.Cool it, cool it.I don't want to get into no discussions
on an empty stomach anyhow.This is flat.Vampira!Bring your kit.You rang?Hey, you don't sound exactly
too thrilled to serve the leader.Oh, on the contrary, I find it a rare
privilege to serve His Royal Lowest.Hey, you're cute.
Like a black widow spider.Shut your mouth
and just take the order, lady.I've decided that I shall not continue
the flight with the fuel I got.So give me a boilermaker,
and heavy on the boil.Go on, go on, go on. Come on,
come on, I haven't got all night.She's crazy about me also.Now, Lost Weekend Jr.,you've ordered your drink.About last night. Would you
like to explain what happened?I told you I was gonna tell you. It's...Why don't we kind of table it a while,
sweetie, huh?I mean, all the kids,
they're kind of waiting, you know.It's Dullsville out. I'll be back.
You take five.And I love you, baby.
Mean it sincerely.You wait for me, huh?Oh, there you are, sweets.
Thanks a lot.Sickening, isn't he?But he's got something.And I mean to find out what it is.I think I'll do a...Do a tune that I'm gonna......record for Poverty Records.That's the only ones that'd have me.<i>I'm in the mood</i><i>For love</i><i>Simply...

for a while, kids, and...Later, Stella. Late...I feel like the girl
on her wedding nightwhose absent-minded husband goes
home to his mother for dinner.- Where is he?
- Where do you think he is?- What time is it?
- I think he's getting his watch fixed.- I hope nothing's happened to him.
- Think he had an accident?- Where is he?
- He's never been late.- 10-to-1 he doesn't show.
- Nothing's wrong.The...<i>Baby, down and down and down I go</i><i>Round and round and round I go</i><i>In a spin</i>

to insure more time.Stronger. Insure more time.Tired. Tired.Yes, Dr. Warfield
appreciated it very much.- Hi, Millie. Can I go right in?
- What's the rush?The faculty, as always, is ready
to serve the needs of the student body.I'm terribly sorry I'm late,
Dr. Warfield.Any time, Miss Purdy. Any time at all.Thank you.Therefore, as I said,
the success or failure of the promrests squarely
on the shoulders of you,the members of the
entertainment committee.Miss Lemmon, will you send in
the proposed list of the entertainers?Good, good. The Lightlighters,
wonderful. Love folk singers.<i>The bluenose beetle</i>
<i>Likes to needle all the people</i>Who is this Wickern and Wett?
Is that the comedy team?Oh, good, good, perfect.My, I thought they'd split up.Who's this Buddy Love?What's a Buddy Love?He's a local boy. He's just terrific.- He's our new leader.
- Leader?- He's, like, too much.
- Like too much what?He's one of the truly great swingers
of all time.Swingers. Swingers of all time. Oh...It seems that you students
know Mr. Love quite well.What about the members
of the faculty?- Anyone here familiar with Mr. Love?
- Oh, he's the greatest.Do you know Mr. Love?Oh, me? No...No, what I meant... Well, I heard
all of the other students, that's...Professor Kelp, I heard that myself.- Yes, you certainly...
- Anyone here know Mr. Love?Very well. In that case, I will have
to insist upon meeting him myself.Will one of you have him come
to my office this afternoon at 3:00?Dr. Warfield.Well, we don't exactly know
how to get in touch with Mr. Love.On such short notice, that is.What do you mean, you don't know
how to get in touch with him?Is he some kind of roving bum
or something?I've never heard of such a thing,
Miss Purdy.- Well, I might run into him tonight.
- That's not good enough.I want to see him today at 3:00.I beg your pardon, Dr. Warfield,
but I just might be ableto see my way clear possibly
to contact this Mr. Love.Professor Kelp,
I don't care who contacts him.Just get him here by 3:00 today
or forget the whole thing.Meeting dismissed.- Where's your pad?
- Oh, it's only about a milefrom the campus, and I have bought
the craziest new drapes...You mean my dictation pad, which
is in my office. I'm terribly sorry.- I'll get it immediately, sir.
- Never mind. What did you want?Mr. Love is waiting outside to see you,
and he's a gasser.I mean, shall I ask him
to come in, sir?If you can do so without fainting,
Miss Lemmon.Yes, sir.You gonna make that
your life's work, baby?Hey, here.Mr. Love?Buddy, to you.What's your moniker, kid?
What do they call you?Mortimer? Harvey? Norman?
Homer? Which is it?You may call me Dr. Warfield,
young man.OK, doc it is. What kind of doctor
are you, by the way, sweetie?Sawbones, is that the idea?Or a head shrinker?
I went to them once. You dig?Head shrinker. He told me
I had a dual personality, you know.Split, schizo and all that jazz.Then he lays an $82 tab on me.
So I gave him 41 bucks,and I said get the other 41
from the other guy.- What's eating you?
- Mr. Love......I sent for you in regard
to the senior prom.However, after seeing you,
might I remind you that my door...Would you think I was terribly rudeif I were to ask you
the name of your tailor?That's wild. Absolutely gorgeous.- Oh, you mean this?
- Just beautiful.Oh, well, it's... Actually,
it's just a ready-made suit.Oh, you're kidding. Not that.Well, it's sort of a handmade-to-order
ready-made suit off the rack.Just magnificent. I think you're
modest. Is that the picture, sweetie?Little modest?
You just got the perfect physique,and anything you put on swings, right?
You look great in?Did you ever think about going
into show business?- Well, I did do a few plays in school...
- Nutty.Nutty. Girls backstage mob you,
swamp you, is that the picture?Stay right there a second,
don't move.- You might say that in my time, I...
- Oh, I'm sorry about that, doc.- You all right?
- Yes.Did you really, really do a job
in show business?Anyone ever tell you you got
a Cary Grant-ish kind of look?- Really? Well, I...
- Did you ever see him walktowards a gal in a picture like that?
Try that walk. Let me see, doc.I'm just curious. Just walk to me
like Cary Grant. Beautiful.Just beautiful. You sure you're doing
the right thing working here?Show business.
What did you do, Shakespeare?- I did <i>Hamlet</i> one time.
- I knew it. <i>Hamlet.</i> Would you do it?- Only once. It's been so long.
- Would you stand right there?- Would you do it for me, doctor?
- Well, if...Come on, baby, lay it on me.
It's gotta be wild. Go ahead.- Let's see. To be...
- Hold it. Do it right. Do it right.- Right?
- Get up on the stage. Let me sit here.- Let me be your audience.
- Really, the faculty may...Come on, you know it's the best thing
in the world for you.- Get up there and perform.
- Well, if you insist.- Let it out. Let it all out.
- To be or not to be...Hold it a second. Hold it. Let's make it
a stage. Let's make it right.Hold it one second, doc.
You're gonna be beautiful.- All right.
- Just beautiful. Go ahead.- There we are.
- Lay it on me.- Am I in the light?
- That's beautiful. Go ahead.- To be or not to be...
- Hold it a second. Hold it. Do it right.Be in show business. Hamlet, right?You gotta play it all the way. Hamlet,
be... Here, put it on. This is... Put it on.- It's gonna make you feel beautiful.
- Oh, I feel it already, yes.You'll play Shakespeare
like it's never been played.- Go on.
- It's a difference.Let it out and enjoy it.- To be, or not to be...
- Hold it a second. Do it right.Hamlet, right? A prince? You've gotta
go all the way. With a sword.- You dig Hamlet. Do it. You'll enjoy it.
- All right.- It's beautiful. You're doing beautifully.
- Fine, thank you.You've wasted all your life
with this school jazz. Go ahead.- I have often thought of chucking it all.
- Go ahead. Do it.- To be, or not to be...
- Hold it one second. Hold it.- Royalty is one thing. A crown.
- Now, just a minute.Do it right. Hamlet. Do it right.
Have the crown.- Well, that's my hat.
- Be Hamlet. Be it the way it should be.There you are. You've got the crown.- Now I think I have it.
- Do Hamlet and really let it out.- You're beautiful.
- To be, or not to be:that is the question:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows- of outrageous fortune...
- Oh, beautiful, doctor.- I'm not through, I...
- Doctor, you choke me.- Wait, wait, I'm not...
- You choke me. It was gorgeous.The prettiest thing I've ever seen
in my life.- I'm not through.
- See you at the prom, doc?- At the prom, yes.
- Behind the footlights, doc?We'll have you there
behind those lights.- I knew it, baby. Enjoy!
- And carry on- the great tradition of the theater.
- Enjoy, you're beautiful.- Thank you.
- Practice that Shakespeare.At the prom, Mr. Love!To be, or not to be:
that is the question...<i>Dear Mr. Love: Looking forward</i>
<i>to your appearance at the prom.</i><i>Here's to show biz.</i><i>You are to be a chaperon</i>
<i>at the senior prom. This is a must!</i>Jennifer. What am I to do, Jennifer?Have you ever thought
of taking poison?Julius taking poison.Hi, doctor.- Kelp.
- Yes, sir.Do you mind?Oh, not at all.
Do you lead, Dr. Warfield?Oh, I am sorry, I did misunderstand.I get terribly carried away,
what with the music.It was a toe-tapper. I must admit that.It's very rare that you do hear
instrumentation these days, you know,what with the folk singers
and all of those.Would you care for some refreshment,
Miss Lemmon?Oh, why, thank you, sir.
I think I would, but let me go.I mean, you really don't have
to bother at all.Oh, there's no bother.
It will be my pleasure.- Kelp.
- Yes, I'll have a lemonade too.Kelp, will you please get us
two lemonades?Oh, I'm terribly sorry, doctor.
I was, again, just so terribly distressedat that wonderful toe-tapper.
Well, zip, and I'm gone.Hi, professor.- Oh, Stell.
- Stell?That is, Miss Purdy. I'm sorry.
How are you?Are you having a good time, dear?I'm having a good time,
but I'd have a much better timeif somebody would ask me to dance.What's the matter, professor,
cat got your tongue?Oh, no, the punch bowl has my arm.- I didn't realize I...
- Here, let me help you.Thank you. I guess I'm
just accident-prone.- Don't worry about it, professor.
- No, I won't worry about it.Come on, let's dance.Oh, yes, all right.
Well, let me leave the... Yes.Dancing sounds like a splendid idea.I believe I neglected to mention,
Miss Purdy,you're looking very beautiful
this evening.You must be looking forward to seeing
your Buddy Love tonight.How did you know that?Oh, well, everyone knows
that he's going to appear here tonight.Oh, here.I guess I'm looking forward
to seeing him.But I can't for the life of me
figure out why.Well, he is quite good-looking,
is he not?Oh, yes, he is.
But that means nothing to me.Well, he... I'm told he is a young man
with a very nice personality.On the contrary.He's rude, disrespectful,
self-centered and discourteous.Well, then it's not
his nice personality?Hardly.Well, I'm told that he's
quite talented, though.Oh, yes, he's very talented.But talent comes in many forms.I believe intelligence is
a greater talent than anything.If Buddy has any real intelligence,he has a fantastic talent
for keeping it hidden.I see. Well, then evidently,
Miss Purdy,whatever it is that you see
in this young man,it must be very well-buried.I think you're getting warm.Well, then perhaps,
and it's just a possibility,he chooses to keep
the inner man locked upso that no one steps on him.Oh, but he should know
I don't want to step on him.And maybe someday
I'll get to prove it to him.If he ever unlocks that inner man
and lets him looseso that I can grab him and hold him.- I'd appreciate it.
- What?That... What I meant was,
that's very nice.Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.Now it's showtime. If you'll all gather
around the bandstand,we'll get the show on the road.Before we go on, I'd like to have you
meet some of the specialistswho've been with our band for many
years. It's Butch Stone up there.You remember Butch, don't you?And my kid brother, Stumpy Brown.Stumpy not only plays
the bass trombone,but also the tuba and sings a little.
And of course, Butch Stone is knownfor that "Good Man Is Hard to Find".We have a great show lined up for
you, a few surprises, including...Why do men keep running
away from me?Now let's get on with the show.The formula.- Jennifer!
- Hi there.Jennifer!My formula.The formula.Jennifer.You've eaten all of my formula.Excuse me.Oh, shut up, you stupid bird.Then I can't suggest
you call your mother and fatherand get them to read you the formula
from the copy you sent.- Can't suggest.
- Oh, what a wonderful bird.Where's the? Where's the phone?Long distance would be area code...Oh, yes, the area code.That's a splen... Splen...
Splendid idea, Jennifer.Hello, Father.Hello.I say, hello, Father.This is Julius. Yeah, I...Julius.J... Yes, your son.I just... Would you be
good enough, Dad,to open the formula for me and read
it to me so that I can mark it down?Yes, I certainly...
Actually, I'd apprec... Yes.Just gonna have to be enough,
that's all.Where can he be?I hope nothing's happened
to prevent his getting here.Well, he'd better get here,
or there'll be a riot.Thank you. Thank you very much.Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the next performeris actually one of the easiest chores
I've ever had.Well, simply because this card
I'm holding is the announcementthat the performer wants read
exactly as written.That makes it easy."Ladies and gentlemen, presenting
the world's greatest everything."The best dressed,
the swingingest performer"and one of the nicest guys
in the whole world."Here he is, the 1963 senior prom's

I'm not usually at a...I'm not usually at a loss for words......but if you just......bear with me a moment,
I think I might be able to explain.It happened some time ago.Being a scientist......I just happened
to have stumbled on......one of the curious mysteries
of science.I found myself......so curious that I was......unable to......just stop.Nonetheless......I never really knew
what was going to prevail.I do know now that I......should have left it alone.Actually.But......it is a very, very hard thing to do.Particularly when you......found that you've been able
to do something......that so many others failed to do.Therefore...Actually, I...I have no real defense
for my actions other thanI had no control over
what I said or did as......Buddy Love.I can only say...I... I hope...I hope I haven't hurt anyone...Hurt anyone.I didn't mean to hurt anyone.And I didn't mean to do......anything that wasn't of a kind nature.Learning a lesson in life is...Is never...It's never really too late.And I think that the...The lesson that I learned
came just in time.I don't want to...I don't want to be something
that I'm not.I didn't like being someone else.At the same time, I'm very glad I was.Because I found out something
that I never knew.You might as well like yourself.Just think about all the time
you're gonna have to spend with you.And...Well......if you don't think too much
of yourself,how do you expect others to?That's what I found out.Dr. Warfield.I'm very sorry and......I like it here at the university
very much.I hope that...I hope that after you hear the facts,you won't think
too terribly wrong of me.Because I love everybody here,
and I...I wouldn't really like to leave, actually.Can I be of any assistance, professor?Oh.No, thank you very much. I'll...I'll have to just try and work this out
myself, thank you.Well, there's......really nothing to work out,
professor, other thanto understand thatjust being one person ismore than enough
for any human being to handle.You mean that?Well, you have to understand that...Well, you have to understand that...I'm only trying to say thatI wouldn't ever wanna spend the rest
of my life with anyone like Buddy.But......being the wife of a professor
would be much more normal and......much happier.Oh, Stella.You see, I...I told you I'm accident-prone.That's actu..."The psychological properties

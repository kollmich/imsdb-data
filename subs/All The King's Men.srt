1
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:18,285
<i>To find something, anything...</i>

2
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:22,915
<i>... a great truth,
or a lost pair of glasses...</i>

3
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:27,796
<i>... you must first believe there will be
some advantage in finding it.</i>

4
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:31,466
<i>I found something a long time ago...</i>

5
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,229
<i>... and have held on to it
for grim death ever since.</i>

6
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,397
<i>I owe my success in life to it.</i>

7
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:41,043
<i>It put me where I am today.</i>

8
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:43,270
<i>This principle:</i>

9
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:49,115
<i>What you don't know won't hurt you.</i>

10
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:57,124
<i>They called it idealism
in a book I read.</i>

11
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:11,190
<i>Get the gun.
Get the gun. Get the gun.</i>

12
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:17,403
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

13
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,300
The judge won't scare easy.

14
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,799
I don't count on him scaring easy.

15
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:58,011
You think it's beneath my dignity?

16
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,944
Well, you're governor, they tell me.

17
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,607
Yeah, I'm governor.

18
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,948
The trouble with governors is they
think they gotta keep their dignity.

19
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,818
There's nothing worth doing
a man can do to keep his dignity.

20
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:10,516
Human frame ain't built that way.

21
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:14,795
When I'm not governor anymore
because I'm president...

22
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,524
...I wanna meet somebody at midnight,
I'll do that then too.

23
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:20,759
Hope you leave me
to get a night's sleep.

24
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:23,531
No, Jack, you going with me
because that's what you want.

25
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,167
Yeah, you and Sugar
with me in the White House.

26
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:29,175
I'll give Sugar a pistol range
right out there in the garden.

27
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,677
Brace of Republican senators
can set up his tin cans for him.

28
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,409
And I'm gonna appoint
a special member to Cabinet for you:

29
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:39,351
Secretary to the Bedchamber
of Mr. Jack Burden.

30
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,620
Somebody to keep them
telephone numbers straight...

31
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,284
...and return their little pink silk articles
that get left behind.

32
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:50,032
But we gotta do this first.

33
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,293
In the middle of the night when we
could just do it in town sometime.

34
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:56,370
Sometime ain't never now.

35
00:04:57,874 --> 00:04:59,967
Bastard.

36
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,238
Which way up there?

37
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:07,650
Jack, tell Sugar
how to get to the house.

38
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,880
It's your people live down here.

39
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,566
Suppose he don't open up?

40
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,901
Make him. What I pay you for?

41
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,144
Hey, Jack.

42
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:12,281
Mr. Duffy.

43
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:15,648
This is Willie Stark
from up Mason City.

44
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,786
- County treasurer.
- Glad to meet you.

45
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:21,121
<i>- Jack Burden.
- From The Chronicle.</i>

46
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,780
Good to meet you, Mr. Burden.

47
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,359
Yeah, Willie's on business
for Mason City.

48
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:26,859
Bond issue them got up there.

49
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,157
Gonna build a schoolhouse.

50
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:33,063
Yeah. Me and Willie
was in school together.

51
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:37,138
Oh, you was in school, Alex.
I didn't know.

52
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,399
Not the teacher's favorite,
I don't expect.

53
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,839
No, sir, that's true.

54
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:45,242
Willie was, though.
Still is, ain't you, Willie?

55
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:47,747
Yeah, Willie married
a schoolteacher.

56
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:50,046
Well, you know...

57
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,620
...they tell me that schoolteachers
are made with it...

58
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,655
...in the same place as the rest.

59
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:58,987
Now, is that right or not, Mr. Stark?

60
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:05,391
Yeah, that's right.

61
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:09,804
Slade!

62
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,906
Beers all around.

63
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:13,542
Not for me, thanks.

64
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,473
Oh, that little schoolteacher
don't like it when you drink?

65
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,274
Well, she don't favor it, for a fact.

66
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:24,178
Well, beers all around.

67
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,846
Well, I sell beer
to those who want it.

68
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:29,881
I don't make nobody drink them.

69
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:33,857
Well, maybe you got some
orange pop for him.

70
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,258
That's what he wants.

71
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,726
Yeah, I think I'd like some orange pop.
Two straws.

72
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,306
Jack, get up Mason City.

73
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,810
See who's this fella
who thinks he's Jesus Christ...

74
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:53,809
...come down off the cross to scourge
the moneychangers...

75
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,543
...out of that shinplaster courthouse
they got them there.

76
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:59,449
I know who he is.
Fella with a Christmas tie...

77
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:01,055
...pushed a school bond through.

78
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,719
- You know him?
- Met him.

79
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:06,020
Watched him drink
a bottle of orange pop once...

80
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:09,358
...through two straws on account
of a wife who don't favor drinking.

81
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,693
She favor him
staying parish treasurer?

82
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,733
Don't you know
how things are run up there?

83
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:16,167
Run up there
like they're run down here.

84
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:21,242
Yeah? Well, you leave down here
and run on up there.

85
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,178
As a commissioner, as chairman,
I guess you're in a position...

86
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,017
...to know the situation
regarding the schoolhouse contract.

87
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:36,419
Ain't no situation.

88
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,423
Maybe not, but maybe so.

89
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:40,357
Ain't any situation.

90
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:42,125
Board took a bid offer.

91
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,391
A.J. Moore's bid, the fella's name...

92
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,660
...schoolhouse gets built.

93
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:49,168
This Moore fella's bid,
I take it, was the lowest?

94
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,401
Now, you lookie here.

95
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,566
Ain't nobody tells a board
what bid to take.

96
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,679
Anybody can come along
put in a little pissant bid.

97
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,178
Board doesn't have to take it.

98
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:01,475
Board takes somebody
who can do the work right.

99
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,175
Ain't nothing done but legal.

100
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:06,116
Who was it
put in the little pissant bid?

101
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:09,190
- Name of Jeffers, if I recollect.
- Jeffers Construction?

102
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:12,156
- Yeah.
- Well, that's a real firm, a big firm.

103
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,123
The board picks
who can do the work right.

104
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,824
That's all I got to say.

105
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:20,696
Don't you wanna tell mama...

106
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,668
...you wanna see yourself
shining in the table? No?

107
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,331
All right. I wish I could have
sold some to you.

108
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,274
Be out of your way in a second here.
And no brushes, you sure?

109
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,743
- I'm sure.
- All right.

110
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:34,405
Thank you.
Thank you for your time. Bye-bye.

111
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:35,812
Mr. Stark.

112
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:42,322
Why, Mr. Jack Burden,
how are you, sir?

113
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:45,824
You know, people would think
parish treasurer paid well enough...

114
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:49,089
...a man wouldn't have to sell
household fix-it kits door-to-door.

115
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,166
- People would think.
- Doesn't in Mason City.

116
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:55,361
Well, I'm maybe not so good
at mathematics...

117
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,733
...as some other parish treasurers
you may've met.

118
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:00,034
Or too good at it.

119
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:03,304
How much they steal
on the schoolhouse contract?

120
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,174
Well, let's see... .

121
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:08,614
Jeffers come in $ 142,000.

122
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:11,082
Moore, $ 175,000.

123
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:15,384
That's $33,000 split six ways,
5500 per commissioner.

124
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:19,756
They done it so plain and pretty, well,
you'd almost have to admire them.

125
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,591
Just point out Jeffers
uses nigra laborers...

126
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:25,632
...skilled men, you know?

127
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,498
Next thing, it's, "Lookie here, nigras
making more money than you men.

128
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,606
Pushing wheelbarrows,
hauling dirt."

129
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,067
And that's it. "Goodbye, Mr. Jeffers
and your low bid.

130
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:39,146
You go build your nigra schoolhouse
somewhere else."

131
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:42,216
Not that you didn't try and get people
to see what was going on.

132
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:46,822
Oh, I yelled so long and loud about
these old boys lining they pockets...

133
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,287
...I'm lucky to have
any job in Mason City:

134
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,551
Government, door-to-door,
or any other variety.

135
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:53,558
I stood out there
on that street corner...

136
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:55,720
...pencil in one hand,
paper in the other...

137
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,889
...trying to show people
the numbers.

138
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:00,763
But you stop people out there
in that hot sun...

139
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:03,166
...try to show them arithmetic...

140
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,500
...well, they can't see it so clear...

141
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:09,042
...through the sweat pouring in they
own eyes from they own hard labor.

142
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,044
Especially if you put nigras
in the equation.

143
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,047
- Why, you're likely to get beat up.
- Likely?

144
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,310
Once or twice.

145
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:19,587
You gonna run again in November?

146
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:24,590
No, I'm done. A lame duck. Lucy too.
They got her fired from teaching.

147
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,594
And I don't care. I don't want to teach
there just so they can steal money.

148
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:32,200
That's right. You're looking at your
own private two-person leper colony.

149
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:33,995
Sipping pop.

150
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:36,537
So, what are you gonna do, then?

151
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:41,871
I don't know. String my pa a fence,
slop some pigs, milk some cows.

152
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:49,478
I'm gonna keep the faith, Mr. Burden,
that's what I'm gonna do.

153
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,285
I'm gonna keep the faith
in the people, because you know why?

154
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,219
Time...

155
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:01,761
...brings all things to light.

156
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:04,765
I trust it's so.

157
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:39,966
Joe.

158
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,161
Did you get a photograph of him?

159
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:43,828
Who?

160
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:49,567
The next mayor of this town.

161
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:03,748
You know what people are saying?

162
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:07,221
People are saying
that God himself had a hand...

163
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:10,388
...in this schoolhouse business.

164
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:15,299
That God stepped in
on Willie Stark's side.

165
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:20,332
Yes, sir. He does work
in mysterious ways sometimes.

166
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,409
Sometimes...

167
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,411
...he has somebody else do it.

168
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:30,450
Sends over a fat man in a striped suit
with a big car to do his will.

169
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:34,055
Well, I have had
some worse employers, I admit that.

170
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:37,022
What you want?

171
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,452
Well, I wanna work for you,
Mr. Stark.

172
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,065
And you wanna work for the people,
unless I been misinformed.

173
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:46,497
People vote me,
I'd be privileged to serve them.

174
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:50,628
- What, as the county treasurer?
- Yes, sir.

175
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,699
Mr. Stark, you could run
for mayor of Mason City...

176
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:58,404
...and you could win without climbing
out of bed in the morning.

177
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,310
You just put the word out...

178
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:04,617
...about Willie Stark, who tried to take
on the crooks single-handed...

179
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:07,119
...Willie Stark,
who tried to warn us...

180
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:12,090
...Willie Stark, who could have saved
our kids if we'd have just listened.

181
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:18,524
Now, I'm not talking about Willie Stark
for the mayor of Mason City. No, sir.

182
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:21,192
I'm talking about Willie Stark...

183
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,171
...as the next governor
of the great state of Louisiana.

184
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:31,335
Now, you saw a man
holding out a handful of cash to you...

185
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,414
...and you said no.

186
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,174
This is what I see.

187
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:37,819
I see a man in a booth...

188
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,922
...Iooking down at a ballot,
a working man.

189
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,221
And he sees three names there:
Harrison, MacMurphy and Stark.

190
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,358
Now, what this man really sees...

191
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:51,500
...is that picture in the newspaper
of them three little coffins...

192
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,028
...and the one man since
the great Governor Stanton died...

193
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:58,833
...that had the guts to buck the powers
that killed them.

194
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:02,440
Now, that man, that voting man,
he's got a pencil...

195
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,738
...he checks a box,
you wake up governor.

196
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,708
And that little lady lying
beside you...

197
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:12,183
...the one that don't favor liquor...

198
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,522
...she wakes up the governor's wife.

199
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:22,221
That's what I see.

200
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,999
Now, why don't you take a minute
with your orange pop...

201
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,769
...see if you can't see it too...

202
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,070
...governor.

203
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,571
You got your speech?

204
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:08,538
All right.

205
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:14,014
Willie Stark!

206
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,355
Thank you, folks.

207
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:24,816
Thank you kindly.

208
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:28,995
My name's Willie Stark
from Mason City yonder...

209
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:33,993
...and I'm pleased to have a chance
to talk with you all here today.

210
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:36,137
Now, friends...

211
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:40,703
...what I wanna talk about is
something that's been troubling me.

212
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,674
- Coffee, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

213
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:50,281
Can I sit with you?

214
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:52,010
Or anything else.

215
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:55,016
No, thanks.

216
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:58,684
- You don't like my looks?
- I don't care about anybody's looks...

217
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,852
...but I can't recall
ever going for anyone...

218
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,555
...who reminds me
of a box of spilled spaghetti.

219
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,262
Miss Burke, I'm sitting here
having a cup of coffee.

220
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:09,734
I'm almost through,
then you couldn't sit with me...

221
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,840
...which is what you asked for.
- Sorry.

222
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,473
Not working
for Sen-Sen Puckett anymore.

223
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,210
- Now, he wasn't a bad-Iooking fellow.
- Heel.

224
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,613
Well, sure, politically and elsewise.

225
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,617
Who didn't know that?

226
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:28,018
I guess I'm slower on some things
than others.

227
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,090
- Like you.
- Am I?

228
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,386
- I think so.
- I think not.

229
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:33,823
Not on this charade.

230
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,892
That's the topic of the interview.

231
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,797
Then tell me, if you're so smart.

232
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:44,837
All right. Harrison's a city man,
MacMurphy's a cracker.

233
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:47,805
Not a cracker precisely,
but enough of one to worry Harrison...

234
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,341
...that crackers won't know
the difference.

235
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:53,072
So Harrison looks for someone
to split the cracker vote.

236
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,944
Hears about an honest man
up in Crackerville...

237
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,586
...where some cracker kids go down
with a fire escape...

238
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:01,621
...that was supposed to be stuck with
more than spit to their schoolhouse.

239
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,418
Sends his man Tiny Duffy up there
to romance him...

240
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:07,858
...and then Sadie Burke
to romance him some more.

241
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,657
Both telling him how good he is...

242
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:13,199
...how he has better than a chance
in hell to change things in this state...

243
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:14,892
...where nothing will ever change.

244
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,935
Because you and Tiny
and the rest of them...

245
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:20,200
...don't care how much of a fool
you make a man.

246
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,707
And you do care, I suppose?

247
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:25,108
I didn't say that. I don't care.

248
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,272
If I did, I'd do something about it,
wouldn't I?

249
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,544
No, I'd rather watch from here.

250
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,383
Like passing a car crash.

251
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:38,859
I know you all can't see this
from all the way back there...

252
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:41,757
...but I've got a pie chart
representing it.

253
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:45,692
And you can see here where
public welfare and hospitals end up.

254
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:06,183
They should be the same.

255
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,791
Rather, the ratio... .

256
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,811
We should go.

257
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:32,810
Not yet.

258
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:35,040
Let's go in again.

259
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,527
You don't wanna swim?

260
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:12,042
How you think we doing?

261
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,354
Fine, I guess.

262
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:16,819
You think?

263
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,927
That how you reporting it?

264
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:21,659
Sure.

265
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:28,135
Seems to me they listen less and less
the further I get from home.

266
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,965
Well, that makes sense,
don't you think?

267
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,471
Maybe...

268
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,504
...you trying to say too much.

269
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,216
I'm telling them
what they need to know:

270
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:45,114
Taxes, wages, highways.

271
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,084
Well, maybe it's how
you're telling them.

272
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:50,054
Maybe if you told them
the way you tell Lucy or Tiny or me...

273
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,386
...or anyone face to face,
they'd listen better.

274
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,328
I don't know how that is.

275
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:56,760
Hard to know how you sound
to somebody else.

276
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:00,197
Mad, fed up, like you mean business
is how you sound.

277
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,530
But not on the platform.
You climb three steps...

278
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:06,800
...you sound like the rest of them. Like
a man who wants to win an election.

279
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,046
Willie... .

280
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:14,739
Yeah?

281
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,045
What?

282
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:22,747
Nothing.

283
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:27,656
Well, a man don't have to be governor.

284
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:30,965
I don't deny wanting it.

285
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:35,331
I won't lie to you,
I lie awake wanting it.

286
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:40,168
But sometimes a man
can want something so bad...

287
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,534
...be so full of want...

288
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:48,980
...he plain forget what it is he want.

289
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,882
I could have been a good governor.

290
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:57,182
A lot better than them other fellas.

291
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:03,128
But I ain't gonna be governor.

292
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,666
Hi.

293
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,830
Come on in. Why not?

294
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:16,007
Oh, Mr. Stark.

295
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,479
Sadie.

296
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:24,582
What's up?

297
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,620
Willie here was just telling me
how he's not gonna be governor.

298
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:30,819
You told him?

299
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,923
No, I didn't, as a matter of fact, no.

300
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:41,128
Told me what?

301
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:50,104
Told me what?

302
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:05,317
Oh, yeah, well, that makes sense.

303
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:07,587
I see.

304
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:14,202
So that's true? I'm being used.

305
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,667
So they tell me.

306
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:22,371
I saw it in his eyes the first time
he come to see me, Tiny.

307
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:26,875
But I just pushed it out of my head.

308
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,943
Pushed it clean out.

309
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,352
I should've known better.

310
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:03,175
Mr. Stark?

311
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:04,913
Mr. Stark?

312
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:18,357
You thought you were the little
white lamb of God, didn't you?

313
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,597
Just waiting for the chance to stand
on your hind legs and make a speech.

314
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:28,768
They would have paid you
to play the part. They pay me.

315
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:32,138
But you were too stupid
to see even that.

316
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:35,009
You did it for free.

317
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:41,721
You're just their dumb sacrificial sap
and I'm... .

318
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:49,455
I'm sorry I let them.

319
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:16,652
Your stomachaches, your colics,
your bloats, your diarrhea.

320
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:32,630
You're looking a little peaked.

321
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:36,201
I can't imagine.

322
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:38,005
Slept like a baby.

323
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,677
Got your speech?

324
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,952
All right, then. Let's go. It's time.

325
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,353
"Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here."

326
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,058
What?

327
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:55,462
The song.

328
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:00,534
Yeah. That's what it is.

329
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,152
Hello. Hello.

330
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:30,528
How are you?

331
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,668
Here's that speech
you was just asking about.

332
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:40,841
My name is Willie Stark
from Mason City yonder.

333
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,444
I had a speech...

334
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:46,507
...about this state and what it needs.

335
00:26:47,382 --> 00:26:50,078
There's no use in me telling you
about it, you are the state.

336
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:52,117
You know what you need.

337
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:55,381
Look at the knees of your pants.

338
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:58,018
Look at your crops.

339
00:26:58,193 --> 00:26:59,524
Look at your kids.

340
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:02,686
You got holes and rot...

341
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:06,027
...and ignorant offspring
on account of this state.

342
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:11,399
Well, I had a speech,
but I ain't got it no more.

343
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:15,100
Mr. Duffy got it now
in his fat little hands.

344
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,505
Don't you, Tiny?

345
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:20,045
Go ahead, show the people.
Hold it up.

346
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,412
Well, since he got it...

347
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:27,146
...I'm gonna have to say
something else.

348
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:29,815
It's all right.

349
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:33,318
Because I got something else
to say.

350
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:38,095
I got a story about a redneck hick.

351
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:40,666
He's like yourselves, if you please.

352
00:27:41,136 --> 00:27:46,540
Well, this fella, a while back,
this hick...

353
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:50,945
...started thinking about
all the other hicks...

354
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:53,478
...what he could do for them.

355
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:56,584
Well, one day...

356
00:27:56,751 --> 00:28:01,688
...it came down
with the powerful force...

357
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:04,484
...of God's own hand...

358
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:09,621
...when the only brick schoolhouse
ever built in his parish...

359
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:15,259
...collapsed on account of it was built
with politics-rotted brick.

360
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:21,171
And it killed and mangled
a batch of poor, young scholars.

361
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,569
Oh, you know this story.

362
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,442
You heard it.

363
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:30,015
He fought the politics
that built that schoolhouse...

364
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,483
...with rotten brick and bolts.

365
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:35,853
But he lost.

366
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:37,787
He lost.

367
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:40,160
And it fell.

368
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:41,890
It fell.

369
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:47,495
Well, it wasn't long...

370
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:52,368
...before some public officials
from the city...

371
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,509
...rode out in their big fine car...

372
00:28:55,677 --> 00:29:00,705
...and told this hick how they
wanted him to run for governor.

373
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:04,049
Them in them striped pants,
they told me...

374
00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:07,052
...MacMurphy was a limberback...

375
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:11,420
...Joe Harrison, he was just a tool
of the city machine.

376
00:29:11,593 --> 00:29:16,895
And they wanted this nobody,
do-gooder hick...

377
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,192
...to step in,
give them some honest government.

378
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,164
You know who they were?

379
00:29:22,237 --> 00:29:24,467
In that big fine car?

380
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,405
They was Joe Harrison's
own lickspittles...

381
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,947
...coming in to split MacMurphy's
hick vote!

382
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:38,585
That's right! Your hick vote!

383
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:40,687
There he is!

384
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,117
There he is right there.

385
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:48,024
There's the Judas Iscariot lickspittle
nose-wiper from the city, right there.

386
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:51,859
Come on, Tiny. Look at him.
Joe Harrison's dummy.

387
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:55,093
Come on, take a bow. Come on. No,
come on now, people wanna see you.

388
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,262
Take a bow, come on.
There he goes.

389
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:01,635
No! No, let him lie! Let him lie!

390
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,938
Let that hog lie in his own filth!

391
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:07,581
Let him lie,
but listen to me, you hicks.

392
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:11,378
That's right, I'm not the only one here.
You hicks too.

393
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:16,252
They fooled you, too, just like
they fooled me a thousand times.

394
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:18,984
But it's time I fooled somebody.

395
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,651
It's time I fooled them.

396
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,630
Them big-city, striped-pants lickspittle
hick-haters.

397
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,667
I'm running for governor on my own.

398
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:33,171
I'm coming for them
and I'm coming for blood!

399
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:41,108
First thing I'm gonna do
is build me a road out...

400
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:45,150
...across the swamps and alligators
and anything else that gets in my way.

401
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,221
A thousand miles of concrete,
if that's what it takes...

402
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:52,257
...so I can come out here and visit with
my fellow hicks on a regular basis.

403
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:55,487
Then I'm gonna build me a bridge
across that mighty Mississippi.

404
00:30:55,663 --> 00:30:58,461
Name it after myself
because I'm the one who built it.

405
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,658
Then I'm gonna build you all
new schools.

406
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:04,635
Send your kids home with free tablets
and pencils and books...

407
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:08,708
...to study and learn on the way
to the new university I'm gonna build...

408
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:11,505
...where every one of them can go.

409
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,271
Same as rich folks' kids.

410
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:17,510
Now, I hope you're listening,
you hicks.

411
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:21,382
Because I don't wanna drive
all the way back home...

412
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:25,356
...just to drive back out here
next week to tell you again.

413
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:26,892
And this is it:

414
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:31,131
If you don't vote...

415
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:33,529
...you don't matter.
You don't matter!

416
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:35,464
You don't matter!

417
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:38,834
And then you're just as ignorant
as them in the city say you are...

418
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:40,998
...while they stealing food
off your table...

419
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:43,666
...and every nickel out your pocket,
saying, "Thank you."

420
00:31:43,845 --> 00:31:49,010
Because then you are just a bunch
of ignorant hicks who got nothing...

421
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:51,174
...because you deserve nothing.

422
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:53,316
So listen to me.

423
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:55,080
Listen here.

424
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:56,848
Lift your eyes...

425
00:31:57,025 --> 00:32:01,826
...and look on the God's blessed
and unflyblown truth:

426
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:07,400
You are a hick and ain't nobody
never helped a hick but a hick hisself.

427
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:12,563
It's up to you
to nail these parasites up.

428
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,006
- Up to you and me and God.
- Amen!

429
00:32:17,178 --> 00:32:20,443
- Nail up Joe Harrison!
- Nail him up!

430
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:23,311
- Nail up MacMurphy!
- Nail him up!

431
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:26,715
And nail up any bastard
that gets between you...

432
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:29,083
...and the roads and the bridges
and schools...

433
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:30,747
...and the food you need.

434
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:33,359
You give me the hammer
and I'll do it.

435
00:32:33,528 --> 00:32:36,088
I'll nail their hides to the barn door.

436
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:38,095
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

437
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:39,927
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

438
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:41,796
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

439
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,801
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

440
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:45,701
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

441
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:47,602
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

442
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:49,538
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

443
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:51,372
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

444
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:53,275
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

445
00:32:53,448 --> 00:32:55,040
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

446
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:57,047
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

447
00:32:57,218 --> 00:32:58,879
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

448
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:30,109
More about Stark?

449
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:32,377
He's colorful. Makes it easy.

450
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,488
You know me,
always looking for easy.

451
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:50,667
<i>Jack. You know what
The Chronicle line is on the election.</i>

452
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:55,101
Sure. MacMurphy again because of his
brilliant record as an administrator...

453
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:57,506
...and high integrity as a statesman.

454
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,513
Why can't you put that in your column,
a little less of Stark's raving madness?

455
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:08,783
Listen, Jack.
I know Stark's a friend of yours but--

456
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:11,925
He's not a friend of mine. Personally,
I don't care who's governor.

457
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,993
Are you telling me what to write,
or am I mistaken?

458
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:16,995
<i>- You know The Chronicle line.
- All right.</i>

459
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,464
What do you mean, "All right"?

460
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:28,338
I mean it the way I said it.

461
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:43,653
I, Willie Stark, do solemnly swear...

462
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:48,228
...that I will support the constitution
and laws of the state of Louisiana.

463
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:51,832
<i>Willie didn't need me
to get himself elected.</i>

464
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:54,024
<i>He won by a landslide.</i>

465
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:58,196
<i>By the biggest margin in the history
of the state.</i>

466
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:02,570
- All the duties incumbent upon me
as governor so help me God.

467
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:05,811
<i>Which isn't to say
everyone voted for him.</i>

468
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,039
Jack, get up Mason City.

469
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:09,808
<i>My editor didn't vote for him.</i>

470
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:12,418
- Thinks he's Jesus Christ
come down off the cross... .

471
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:16,115
<i>The publisher of this paper
didn't vote for him.</i>

472
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:20,891
<i>These men didn't vote for him.</i>

473
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:24,025
<i>Or these.</i>

474
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:27,167
The governor's education bill
does not pass.

475
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:32,466
<i>Or the old boys in the Senate who
were in the pockets of the oilmen.</i>

476
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:40,107
<i>My mother didn't vote for him.</i>

477
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:45,179
<i>This is my mother.</i>

478
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,618
<i>She doesn't vote.</i>

479
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:54,923
<i>Over there, on her dressing table...</i>

480
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:57,792
<i>... that's her with her first husband.</i>

481
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:02,095
<i>First of four, if I recollect.</i>

482
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:07,037
<i>And that's my godfather on the right,
the best man.</i>

483
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,006
<i>He didn't vote for Willie either.</i>

484
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,144
<i>In fact...</i>

485
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:16,613
<i>... I think it's safe to say nobody from
where I'm from voted for Willie Stark.</i>

486
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:19,986
<i>And why should they?</i>

487
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:21,985
<i>His promises to the poor...</i>

488
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:24,249
<i>... to build roads and bridges
and schools...</i>

489
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:28,183
<i>... were a declaration of war
on the rich.</i>

490
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:32,960
<i>They wanted him out.</i>

491
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:48,879
You Jack Burden?

492
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:56,218
I've come at the behest of the boss.

493
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:57,854
Who?

494
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:00,323
The boss? The governor?

495
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,704
Governor, let me put it in simple words
so you understand:

496
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:15,309
There's no money for all these things
you wanna do for the poor.

497
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:17,068
Oh, there's money, senator.

498
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:19,679
You're wrong there.
There's plenty of money.

499
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:23,405
Every kilowatt comes out of the river,
every barrel of oil from the ground.

500
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,075
But that doesn't belong to you, sir.

501
00:37:26,254 --> 00:37:30,054
That's right. Don't belong to you either
or them. Belongs to the state.

502
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:35,329
How about the state don't tax just 5%
to build my roads, we take it all?

503
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:38,590
These are some powerful companies
you talking about taking money from.

504
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:41,166
- They ain't gonna stand for it.
- They ain't the power.

505
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:43,326
The power's in the hands
of the powerless...

506
00:37:43,504 --> 00:37:45,529
...and those hands
have handed it to me.

507
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:54,579
Realistically, they'll approve
half the money, maybe.

508
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,410
And that's after we beat them up.

509
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,814
So we build them half a highway.

510
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,887
Mile of concrete, mile of dirt,
mile of concrete, mile of dirt...

511
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,546
...all the way to Shreveport.

512
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:06,192
Now, how's anybody gonna drive
on that?

513
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,089
People ain't gonna stand for that.

514
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,059
They like their roads finished.

515
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:11,459
That's right.

516
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,891
What's right?

517
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:16,931
Hey, Jack. Sadie, take Tiny
out of here, explain it to him.

518
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:19,436
- He just said it and he don't get it.
- Come on, Tiny.

519
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:21,472
- You want something to eat?
- No, thank you.

520
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:23,075
- Well, sit down.
- Hi, Sadie.

521
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:24,575
Hey.

522
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,481
I heard you got fired.

523
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,210
Oh, you heard wrong. I quit.

524
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:36,152
That's smart. When I get done with that
outfit, they won't be able to pay you...

525
00:38:36,324 --> 00:38:39,122
...nor the nigra
who sweeps the floor.

526
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:42,023
- You want a job?
- Working for whom?

527
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:45,222
- The state?
- Hell, no.

528
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:46,930
Me.

529
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:49,092
You, me, Sadie, Tiny.

530
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,637
Tiny? I was surprised to hear
Tiny was back.

531
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,337
Well, somebody gotta be
lieutenant governor.

532
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,578
Yeah, sure.

533
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:03,280
I keep Tiny around...

534
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:06,942
...to remind me of something
I never wanna forget.

535
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:09,417
And that is?

536
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,554
When they come around
sweet-talking, don't listen.

537
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:16,723
Never again.

538
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,059
What would I be doing for you?

539
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,133
Sweet-talking.

540
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,141
All right, everybody.

541
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:39,013
What on earth is that?

542
00:39:39,186 --> 00:39:41,450
- This is a ballista.
- A what?

543
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:45,456
Jack will tell you all about it.
Jack, come on. Tell them.

544
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:49,687
It's a pre-gunpowder weapon
fired with the tension of animal sinew.

545
00:39:49,864 --> 00:39:51,422
Oh, my God.

546
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:07,074
Jack?

547
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:12,752
Right. See the eagle
on top of the clock?

548
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:16,045
One...

549
00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:18,252
...two... .

550
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,638
They say you're in politics,
Mr. Burden?

551
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,210
It must be fascinating
to be in politics.

552
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:42,044
It's not, I assure you.

553
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:44,741
Well, they say
you're very influential.

554
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:47,945
It must be fascinating
to be very influential.

555
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:49,419
I honestly wouldn't know.

556
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:54,323
Don't let him kid you, Miss DuMonde.
My godson Jack is very influential.

557
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,395
Like when he was a newspaperman.

558
00:40:56,564 --> 00:40:58,259
All right, then, yes, I'm influential.

559
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:01,595
Any pals in the pen anyone
wants pardoned, I'll put in the word.

560
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,203
Well, there is gonna be
somebody in the pen.

561
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:07,033
Before it's over,
what's going on there?

562
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,199
All these wild goings-on.

563
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:14,407
Fella giving away the state.
Free this, free that, free the other.

564
00:41:14,582 --> 00:41:18,484
Every wool-hat jackass
thinking the world is free.

565
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:20,979
Who's gonna pay?
That's what I wanna know.

566
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:23,247
Who's he think's gonna pay?

567
00:41:23,424 --> 00:41:25,984
Standard Oil and the utility companies,
I imagine.

568
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,628
And anyone else that can afford
to pay their share.

569
00:41:28,796 --> 00:41:30,991
You and me, George. We'll pay.

570
00:41:31,165 --> 00:41:32,996
Government's committed
these days...

571
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:36,864
...giving services
we never heard of back when.

572
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:41,406
And he's gonna tax this state to death.
Drive business right out.

573
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:43,634
You don't think it boils down to this:

574
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,870
If the government,
for quite a long time now...

575
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,809
...had done anything
for the people...

576
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:50,815
...they wouldn't have got fed up
and elected Mr. Stark.

577
00:41:51,785 --> 00:41:55,585
Well, you ask him this
next time you see him:

578
00:41:55,756 --> 00:42:00,125
Ask him how much grabbing there is,
all that money flowing.

579
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:04,359
Then you ask him what's he gonna do
when they impeach him.

580
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:07,532
There's a constitution in this state...

581
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:10,966
...or was, before he blew it to hell.

582
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,275
- I'll be sure to ask him.
- You do that.

583
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:18,878
Jack, Miss DuMonde plays the piano.

584
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,477
That's nice.

585
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:29,782
You weren't like yourself today, son,
like you used to be.

586
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:34,053
Mother, if I'm ever like I used to be,
do me a favor and shoot me.

587
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:38,130
Who was that at lunch anyway?

588
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,597
Mr. Peyton.
You've known him all your life.

589
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:43,202
He builds electrical plants
or some such.

590
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,270
The girl, Mother. Miss DuMonde.

591
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:50,433
That's Mr. Orton's sister's child
and she will inherit his money.

592
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,512
Somebody ought to wait
until she inherits it, then marry her...

593
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:56,377
...and drown her in her bathtub.

594
00:42:57,117 --> 00:43:00,143
Oh, don't worry,
I'd like to drown her but I won't.

595
00:43:01,188 --> 00:43:03,520
Was Mr. Peyton saying
those people you're with...

596
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:06,592
...are mixed up in some sort of graft?

597
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,921
Graft's what you call it
when who's doing it...

598
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:12,031
...doesn't know which fork to use.
- Well, whatever you call it.

599
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:14,326
- Because I worry to think that--
- I don't know.

600
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:17,561
How would I, careful as I am not
to know what anybody anywhere...

601
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:19,830
...is doing at any time?

602
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:35,420
Oh, Jack, make a note.

603
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:38,353
Find out where they got
Senator Tucson's boy locked up.

604
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:41,858
- What's his name?
- The boy? Hell, I don't remember.

605
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:44,463
Find out when's the trial,
get a lawyer down there.

606
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:49,161
- Who? Evans?
- Not Evans.

607
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,566
Find somebody
with less oil in his hair...

608
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:53,570
...and don't look like he sing
with a band.

609
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:56,107
Put one of your pals on it.

610
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:58,908
You have any idea who it was got cut?

611
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,947
I don't care if it was the sainted aunt
of the Apostle Paul.

612
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:05,278
Well, I just happen to know.

613
00:44:05,452 --> 00:44:07,682
Fella's son of a doctor, paper said.

614
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:11,052
They're pretty important around here,
you know, a doctor in the country.

615
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:13,659
They think they're somebody.

616
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:16,853
And maybe it gets out you're
trying to fix it to get the boy off.

617
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,965
Wouldn't do you any good.

618
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:22,426
- Now, it appears to me, maybe--
- You don't know a goddamn thing.

619
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:24,932
Had you been listening...

620
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:27,733
...I told Jack to prime
the lawyer through a pal.

621
00:44:27,908 --> 00:44:30,672
Find somebody who don't need to
see his name in lights.

622
00:44:30,844 --> 00:44:33,972
That way, nobody knows
who picked him wasn't me.

623
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:39,281
Might as well been the pope
himself far as anybody knows.

624
00:44:39,853 --> 00:44:41,115
All right.

625
00:44:42,156 --> 00:44:43,783
I get you.

626
00:44:43,957 --> 00:44:45,948
Yeah, just barely.

627
00:45:03,644 --> 00:45:05,544
- Hey, there, Pop.
- How you doing, son?

628
00:45:06,213 --> 00:45:09,740
- How you making out?
- Oh, I'm getting along.

629
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:12,283
Good to see you.
You looking good.

630
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:17,487
- I brought the infantry here.
- How are you?

631
00:45:17,658 --> 00:45:20,593
- More prettier than ever.
- Hey, Grandpa.

632
00:45:20,928 --> 00:45:22,520
How you doing, buddy?
How's the arm?

633
00:45:22,696 --> 00:45:25,529
- He gonna be all-American.
- I know he is. I know he is.

634
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:33,104
All right, governor, sir, here we go.
One, two... .

635
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,623
Bastard.

636
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:07,634
Give me a slug.

637
00:46:11,078 --> 00:46:13,569
Pa don't favor drinking.

638
00:46:13,747 --> 00:46:16,272
Used to be Lucy didn't favor it.

639
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:21,952
I don't know what she do
or don't favor no more.

640
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:24,257
Not that it matters.

641
00:46:27,628 --> 00:46:32,395
Yeah, I must have poured 10,000
gallons of swill in them troughs.

642
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,098
Still doing it. Pouring swill.

643
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,670
Some things never change.

644
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:43,865
Hey.

645
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,374
- What's up?
- Judge Irwin.

646
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:53,512
Judge Irwin what?

647
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:56,719
- Spill it.
- I'll spill it when I have my breath.

648
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,188
You're using it up
explaining you don't have it.

649
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,987
You think it's funny?
You won't when I tell you.

650
00:47:02,296 --> 00:47:05,094
- You tell me later.
- Byram rang up.

651
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:08,326
He said the afternoon papers
have got the judge saying...

652
00:47:08,502 --> 00:47:11,835
...the allegations warrant
a full-on investigation.

653
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:13,967
Two-timing bastard.

654
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:18,010
That two-timing bastard.

655
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,408
Clear them out.

656
00:47:21,582 --> 00:47:23,516
Tiny was figuring
on having supper up here.

657
00:47:23,684 --> 00:47:25,413
Clear them all out.

658
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,536
Which way up there?

659
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:49,374
Jack, tell Sugar
how to get to the house.

660
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:52,971
It's your people live down here.

661
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:11,286
Suppose he don't open up?

662
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:15,624
Make him. What I pay you for?

663
00:48:27,981 --> 00:48:31,212
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Jack.

664
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:34,513
Jack?

665
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:36,019
Well, I'll be.

666
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,521
Hey, come on in.

667
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:42,523
You're not in any trouble, are you?

668
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,495
No, Jack's not in any trouble.

669
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:49,898
Matter of fact, he doing all right,
all things considered.

670
00:48:55,542 --> 00:48:59,342
I trust you don't mind
if Jack pours me a slug.

671
00:48:59,713 --> 00:49:02,147
I didn't know his duties
ran to those of manservant...

672
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:04,750
...but if I'm mistaken, I'm sorry.
- Oh, hell.

673
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:07,978
Sometimes Jack pours me a drink,
sometimes I pour him one.

674
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:10,715
Sometimes I pour myself one.

675
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:12,885
I could pour you one.

676
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,755
No, thank you.

677
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,327
This today's?

678
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:24,732
Yeah, I don't get much time
to read the papers...

679
00:49:24,905 --> 00:49:27,703
...rushing around the state
doing the good work.

680
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:30,703
Well, perhaps, I can relieve
your curiosity on one point.

681
00:49:30,877 --> 00:49:32,868
Somewhere in there's my opinion
on the severity...

682
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:35,571
...of the allegations against you,
if that's of interest.

683
00:49:35,749 --> 00:49:37,876
Somebody told me that.

684
00:49:38,552 --> 00:49:41,521
But you know how rumor
hath a thousand tongues.

685
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:45,317
And how them newspaper boys,
they can exaggerate some.

686
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:47,386
It's no exaggeration.

687
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,189
Yeah, I see.

688
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:53,522
If you're clear on that
and finished with your drink...

689
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,634
...I'd appreciate it
if you'd just get out.

690
00:49:55,802 --> 00:49:58,737
Hey, thank you, judge,
I think I will have just one more spot.

691
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:05,066
So I see it there in the paper,
and I hear you say it...

692
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:08,180
...but are you sure
you took it to the Lord in prayer?

693
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:10,747
I settled it in my mind.

694
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:14,375
See, that's unsettling.

695
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,022
Because if I recollect right,
I recollect that...

696
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,590
...when we had our conversation
in town that time...

697
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,321
...you sort of felt like what MacMurphy
and his boys were saying about me...

698
00:50:23,597 --> 00:50:24,859
...was beneath contempt.

699
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,830
I made no commitment to you
or to them, only to my conscience.

700
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:31,027
- I beg your pardon, your what?
- I beg yours.

701
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:38,609
You been toiling around politics too
long to use a word like conscience...

702
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:40,303
...so easily.

703
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,314
No, my change of conscience came
when certain features of your...

704
00:50:44,685 --> 00:50:47,483
...public services, shall we say,
came to my attention.

705
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:50,555
Somebody dug something up for you?
In the dirt?

706
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:53,659
Yeah, not just one thing
and not very deep.

707
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:55,455
Well, dirt's a funny thing.

708
00:50:55,629 --> 00:51:00,259
Ain't nothing but dirt on God's green
earth except what's under the water.

709
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:03,267
And that's dirt too,
come to think of it.

710
00:51:03,837 --> 00:51:05,498
Dirt makes the grass green...

711
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:07,597
...let it breathe.

712
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:11,801
The diamond on my wife's finger
ain't nothing but dirt got awful hot.

713
00:51:11,978 --> 00:51:14,947
What are we, but dirt blowed off
the hands of God almighty?

714
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:18,141
You and me
and George Washington.

715
00:51:20,053 --> 00:51:21,486
And Jack there.

716
00:51:24,491 --> 00:51:25,788
Still doesn't alter the fact.

717
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:29,827
I'm not trying to alter anything,
just illuminate it.

718
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:32,592
Yeah.

719
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:36,133
You saying MacMurphy and his bunch,
yelling for my impeachment...

720
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:39,101
...they're responsible,
law-abiding men?

721
00:51:39,372 --> 00:51:42,637
Yeah, they're responsible all right,
to Alta Power and oil companies...

722
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:44,276
...and the rest of them thieves.

723
00:51:44,444 --> 00:51:45,672
I wouldn't know about that.

724
00:51:45,846 --> 00:51:49,612
Only way to not know
is to not wanna know.

725
00:51:51,384 --> 00:51:55,115
I'm retired, Mr. Stark. A reporter
asked my opinion and I gave it.

726
00:51:55,288 --> 00:51:58,519
If you was retired, no reporter
would wanna ask you anything.

727
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:01,753
What you say matters.

728
00:52:02,062 --> 00:52:04,724
A lot more than you pretend it don't.

729
00:52:06,566 --> 00:52:08,557
So I'm asking you...

730
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:11,403
...call off the dogs.

731
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:17,375
Asking is different than telling
and that sounded like telling to me.

732
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:20,136
Didn't it to you, Jack?

733
00:52:24,518 --> 00:52:26,816
You been a judge a long time.

734
00:52:26,987 --> 00:52:28,614
Yes, I have.

735
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,158
How would it feel, do you think...

736
00:52:34,394 --> 00:52:36,919
...to not be one no more?

737
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,465
No man has ever been able
to intimidate me.

738
00:52:43,637 --> 00:52:47,437
I said what I said and I see no reason
to say or think anything different.

739
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:52,143
Despite your expositions
on laws and men, sir.

740
00:52:54,748 --> 00:52:55,976
Suit yourself.

741
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,981
You're right, Jack.
He don't scare easy.

742
00:53:03,356 --> 00:53:08,623
Judge, it's more in pain
than wrath I go.

743
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:12,359
Let's go.
It's past Sugar Boy's bedtime.

744
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:15,501
Your employer is calling you, Jack.

745
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:19,305
I wouldn't go around
advertising this visit to anyone.

746
00:53:19,472 --> 00:53:21,269
In case you change your mind.

747
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,480
Bastard.

748
00:53:34,387 --> 00:53:37,982
Well, Jackie,
you got a job cut out for you.

749
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:42,028
- MacMurphy.
- No, the judge.

750
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:45,464
You bring down the lion...

751
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:49,500
...the rest of the jungle will quake
in fear and they'll all fall into line.

752
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:53,334
- I won't find anything.
- Oh, yes, you will.

753
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,204
A man is conceived in sin
and born in corruption...

754
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:01,836
...and passeth from the stink of
the didie to the stench of the shroud.

755
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:05,782
You'll find something.

756
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,178
And make it stick.

757
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:20,527
<i>Apart from pleasing the boss,
I could see little advantage...</i>

758
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:26,366
<i>... in finding anything beyond what
was already known about Judge Irwin.</i>

759
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:32,305
<i>What was known
was that he was kind to you...</i>

760
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:36,210
<i>... when your father left you
and your mother without saying why.</i>

761
00:54:38,718 --> 00:54:40,583
<i>What was known
was that he taught you...</i>

762
00:54:40,754 --> 00:54:43,222
<i>.... the things your father
should have:</i>

763
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:46,418
<i>How to be a gentleman.</i>

764
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:49,220
<i>How to firmly shake a hand.</i>

765
00:54:49,729 --> 00:54:53,426
<i>How to safely load a shotgun
and lead a duck if you wanted to hit it.</i>

766
00:54:57,237 --> 00:54:59,171
<i>What was known...</i>

767
00:54:59,673 --> 00:55:03,541
<i>... was that he was more of a father
to you than your real father...</i>

768
00:55:05,712 --> 00:55:08,146
<i>... who you didn't know at all.</i>

769
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,068
Hold it, please.

770
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,867
Governor's penthouse.

771
00:56:43,777 --> 00:56:46,837
How you doing digging
something up on Judge Irwin?

772
00:56:47,213 --> 00:56:48,703
Nothing.

773
00:56:48,915 --> 00:56:51,145
Nothing. Found nothing
or done nothing?

774
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:55,344
There was nothing to find. I could
dig to China, wouldn't find anything.

775
00:56:55,522 --> 00:56:57,353
- And I'm not framing him.
- Framing?

776
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:59,549
Ain't nobody talking about framing.

777
00:56:59,726 --> 00:57:01,091
That's never necessary.

778
00:57:01,261 --> 00:57:04,253
The truth is always sufficient.
You just find the truth.

779
00:57:04,664 --> 00:57:06,188
It's a waste of time and money.

780
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:08,834
Jesus, doesn't anybody listen
to what I say anymore?

781
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:12,563
You don't wanna do it, don't do it.
Or are you just looking for a raise?

782
00:57:13,273 --> 00:57:16,174
I'm gonna give you $ 100 raise
whether you want it or not.

783
00:57:16,342 --> 00:57:17,934
If I wanted more money, I'd make it.

784
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:21,938
You gonna tell me
you work for me for love?

785
00:57:22,115 --> 00:57:25,016
I don't know why I work for you,
but it ain't for love or money.

786
00:57:25,185 --> 00:57:26,584
Well, that's right, it's not.

787
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,717
And you don't know why.

788
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:33,123
But I do.

789
00:57:34,527 --> 00:57:35,926
Why?

790
00:57:36,262 --> 00:57:41,063
Boy, you work for me
because I'm the way I am...

791
00:57:41,234 --> 00:57:43,600
...and you the way you are...

792
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,729
...and that's just an arrangement
founded in the natural order of things.

793
00:57:55,548 --> 00:57:57,914
She sure could skate.

794
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:03,317
Right now...

795
00:58:03,857 --> 00:58:06,121
...hidden away in chambers...

796
00:58:06,593 --> 00:58:09,721
...not out here in the open
like you and me...

797
00:58:10,897 --> 00:58:14,298
...there's a legislature
full of hyena-headed...

798
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:17,903
...belly-dragging sons of bitches...

799
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:21,767
...setting around trying to figure out
how to impeach me.

800
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:26,472
Now, they say it's because
I got crooks on the payroll.

801
00:58:26,646 --> 00:58:28,511
I say, "Is that all?"

802
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:32,585
Of course I got them.
I got a can of oil in the garage too...

803
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:34,515
...because there ain't a machine
made by man...

804
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:39,090
...don't need a squirt of that
from time to time just to keep running!

805
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:44,091
But my crooks...

806
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:47,493
...unlike theirs...

807
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:50,568
...are all atremble...

808
00:58:50,803 --> 00:58:53,169
...to be too crooked.

809
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,771
They're itty-bitty compared
to their crooks in there.

810
00:58:57,944 --> 00:59:00,412
The Standard Oil
and the power companies.

811
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,775
Besides, I got my eye on mine.

812
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:05,577
Ain't nobody watching
over these crooks.

813
00:59:06,186 --> 00:59:09,212
Ain't nobody got their eye on them...

814
00:59:09,389 --> 00:59:13,758
...while they rob
the resources of this state!

815
00:59:15,195 --> 00:59:17,993
Who made that son of a bitch
what he is? Who made him governor?

816
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:20,598
And he goes and two-times me?
I'll kill him.

817
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:23,763
No, he's two-timing Lucy.

818
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:27,134
You need some other kind of
arithmetic for what he's doing to you.

819
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:30,367
Lucy, she's a fool. She's... .

820
00:59:31,344 --> 00:59:33,904
- I don't know what.
- His wife.

821
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:38,916
A hick with a college degree
from some Baptist hole in the ground.

822
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:43,184
What was she like?

823
00:59:44,157 --> 00:59:47,217
- I didn't know Lucy any further back--
- The slut on skates.

824
00:59:48,528 --> 00:59:50,860
I don't know,
I was looking at her skates.

825
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,021
Sure you were.

826
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:58,564
- Was she pretty?
- Look, just forget it.

827
01:00:00,006 --> 01:00:01,906
How young was she?

828
01:00:02,809 --> 01:00:05,573
- Who cares?
- Look at me.

829
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,060
He'll be back.
The world is full of sluts on skates.

830
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:31,302
Skates, grass skirts, geisha outfits.

831
01:00:37,076 --> 01:00:39,101
Contortionists.

832
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:46,614
<i>Every man a king
Every man a king</i>

833
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:50,950
<i>For you can be a millionaire</i>

834
01:00:51,124 --> 01:00:55,117
<i>But there's something
Belonging to others</i>

835
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:59,095
<i>Well, there's enough
For all people to share</i>

836
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:03,901
<i>When it's sunny June
Or December too</i>

837
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:07,471
<i>In the wintertime or spring</i>

838
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:10,234
<i>Well, there'll be peace without end</i>

839
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,742
<i>Every neighbor a friend</i>

840
01:01:12,912 --> 01:01:16,575
<i>With every man a king</i>

841
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,282
The judge married money.
Savannah money.

842
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,088
The daughter of an industrialist
out there.

843
01:01:30,263 --> 01:01:32,231
<i>He's clean, Willie.
He's washed in the blood.</i>

844
01:01:34,634 --> 01:01:38,195
- You call yourself a detective.
- I'm most certainly not--

845
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:41,135
The son of a bitch
is washed in whitewash!

846
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:42,968
- Wanting it isn't the same as being it.
- I know!

847
01:01:43,142 --> 01:01:45,633
- I can feel it.
- That isn't the same either.

848
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:47,677
Where did you find this itty-bitty out?

849
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:49,712
Hall of Records. It's all there.

850
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:52,180
Marriage licenses,
property deeds, public record.

851
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:56,118
The public record is for the public,
not us. That's why it's called that.

852
01:01:56,289 --> 01:01:58,018
You ain't gonna find nothing there!

853
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:01,518
Now, I told you to dig,
not scuff your shoe a little bit.

854
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:05,010
- You gotta get out and talk to them.
- To whom?

855
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:07,176
The public.

856
01:02:07,717 --> 01:02:09,446
The people who knew him.

857
01:02:09,618 --> 01:02:11,108
This was a long time ago.

858
01:02:11,287 --> 01:02:15,621
Well, look, he's still alive, isn't he?
Causing trouble.

859
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:18,783
So you gotta chafe up your hands
a little, for chrissake...

860
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:21,122
...like the rest of us.

861
01:02:26,635 --> 01:02:29,035
Where the hell is everybody?

862
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,639
<i>Whatever there was to find
in the case of the upright judge...</i>

863
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:36,607
<i>... would be long-buried
in the past...</i>

864
01:02:36,779 --> 01:02:39,680
<i>... like a dead cat in the back yard.</i>

865
01:02:42,685 --> 01:02:44,550
<i>But what could be buried there
like that...</i>

866
01:02:45,855 --> 01:02:48,551
<i>... in a place like Burden's Landing?</i>

867
01:02:48,924 --> 01:02:51,415
<i>Where you and your friends
grew up...</i>

868
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:55,360
<i>... shaded
by 300-year-old live oaks...</i>

869
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:58,124
<i>... and the sense
of your own entitlement.</i>

870
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:04,365
<i>To dig around that past
in that back yard...</i>

871
01:03:04,607 --> 01:03:10,273
<i>... you must first- - You tell yourself.
- seek out the girl from that past:</i>

872
01:03:10,813 --> 01:03:12,678
<i>Anne Stanton.</i>

873
01:03:12,848 --> 01:03:15,544
<i>The daughter of the governor
back then.</i>

874
01:03:15,885 --> 01:03:18,979
<i>The little sister
of your best friend, Adam...</i>

875
01:03:20,656 --> 01:03:22,385
<i>... who, one day, you noticed...</i>

876
01:03:22,558 --> 01:03:25,493
<i>... and it struck you
kind of all of a sudden...</i>

877
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:28,027
<i>... wasn't little anymore.</i>

878
01:03:30,866 --> 01:03:34,063
<i>She was the first one
you loved like that.</i>

879
01:03:34,503 --> 01:03:37,336
<i>And the last, it turns out.</i>

880
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:41,943
<i>So you hold on to her pictures
in your mind...</i>

881
01:03:42,678 --> 01:03:44,509
<i>... year after year...</i>

882
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,810
<i>... in the belief that someday
it'll be like that again...</i>

883
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:51,418
<i>... even though
you have no evidence.</i>

884
01:03:53,422 --> 01:03:55,287
<i>In church, they call this faith.</i>

885
01:03:57,159 --> 01:03:59,218
<i>So that's what I'll call it.</i>

886
01:03:59,762 --> 01:04:03,289
Every month or so,
I come out here and light a fire.

887
01:04:03,532 --> 01:04:05,523
Dry the place out.

888
01:04:08,103 --> 01:04:11,004
I know it doesn't really
accomplish that...

889
01:04:11,173 --> 01:04:14,700
...but I got a feeling if I didn't,
if nobody ever came...

890
01:04:15,711 --> 01:04:18,179
...the place would just one day
cave in on itself.

891
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:20,572
Adam never comes out?

892
01:04:20,749 --> 01:04:22,774
No. Not anymore.

893
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:26,978
He took the piano, or someone did.

894
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:30,488
Took it and put it in that place
he's living. Have you seen it?

895
01:04:32,928 --> 01:04:36,694
God forbid my brother
ever spent any money on himself.

896
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:39,159
Or that people knew it.

897
01:04:42,605 --> 01:04:44,505
How's your wife?

898
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,800
I'm sorry, I've forgotten her name.

899
01:04:49,245 --> 01:04:51,713
That didn't quite work out
as I'd hoped.

900
01:04:52,882 --> 01:04:55,476
A lot of tangled bedclothes
and unspoken loathing...

901
01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:57,983
...then spoken loathing
and no tangled bedclothes.

902
01:05:00,422 --> 01:05:03,391
Didn't I read of your engagement
in the society column?

903
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:07,086
Which you know
I always turn to first in the paper.

904
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,492
I was engaged. More than once.

905
01:05:11,634 --> 01:05:13,101
Adam didn't care for any of them.

906
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:18,034
- Why that should matter, I don't know.
- Who needs them, anyway?

907
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:30,485
Anne, way back,
was Judge Irwin ever broke?

908
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,948
What?

909
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:35,823
Judges don't make
the kind of money your father did...

910
01:05:35,991 --> 01:05:37,856
...or my father,
or anyone who lives here.

911
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:41,530
Why on earth would you want
to know such a thing?

912
01:05:41,697 --> 01:05:45,224
- Someone asked me and I didn't know.
- Asked you what?

913
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:47,701
What I just asked you.

914
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,428
Why?

915
01:05:52,141 --> 01:05:54,132
Oh, Jack,
what are you doing for that man?

916
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:57,040
- That man.
- Whatever it is, don't.

917
01:05:57,212 --> 01:06:00,340
That man is what those pushed
away from the trough call him.

918
01:06:00,516 --> 01:06:04,043
Those invited to it
should find another name.

919
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:06,779
Accepting state money
for scholarships...

920
01:06:06,956 --> 01:06:09,015
...is different
from being on his payroll.

921
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:12,217
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

922
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,928
- Oh, don't ruin it.
- What?

923
01:06:20,402 --> 01:06:22,029
Don't ruin this?

924
01:06:22,204 --> 01:06:25,765
Or that fine, beautiful time
we all had here once?

925
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:28,936
You sure that's what it was?

926
01:06:29,878 --> 01:06:33,871
- Yes.
- Then why did it turn into this time?

927
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:37,418
With me drinking myself to death...

928
01:06:37,586 --> 01:06:40,953
...Adam getting more reclusive
and strange...

929
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:44,889
...and you once a month coming out
to a house with the electricity cut off?

930
01:06:46,028 --> 01:06:48,496
This time came from that time.

931
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:53,363
We should go.

932
01:06:55,104 --> 01:06:56,503
The fire can burn.

933
01:06:57,239 --> 01:06:59,469
It will anyway, you know, one day.

934
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,075
What will what anyway?

935
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,211
Cave in on itself.

936
01:07:06,782 --> 01:07:08,511
Everything.

937
01:08:06,909 --> 01:08:09,742
Is the Seaboard Bank in Savannah?

938
01:08:09,912 --> 01:08:12,642
Not since 1938.

939
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:14,778
What happened in '38?

940
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,817
Bought out by Georgia Fidelity.

941
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,688
Got any idea
who was president then?

942
01:08:21,423 --> 01:08:23,254
Franklin Roosevelt.

943
01:08:24,693 --> 01:08:28,129
Ma'am, of the bank.

944
01:08:28,363 --> 01:08:31,389
LeMoyne Carruthers was my friend.

945
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:33,599
A dear friend.

946
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:39,869
And his daughter, Mabel,
well, I did what I could for her...

947
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:43,375
...even after her financial reversal.

948
01:08:45,013 --> 01:08:48,540
The year of her financial reversal
was roughly what?

949
01:08:48,717 --> 01:08:50,685
She threw that inheritance away.

950
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,688
Two or three notes I paid myself.

951
01:08:53,889 --> 01:08:56,722
For the memory of LeMoyne,
my dear friend.

952
01:08:56,892 --> 01:09:02,023
But she'd come back at me without
shame and say, "I want money."

953
01:09:02,197 --> 01:09:06,395
For parties and balls
and to adorn herself.

954
01:09:06,568 --> 01:09:09,469
For she was plain, to be kind.

955
01:09:09,738 --> 01:09:11,797
Then she was broke
when she met the judge.

956
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:14,939
So was he. This is when
he was still attorney general...

957
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,578
...under Governor Stanton
pulling down 3400 a year...

958
01:09:17,746 --> 01:09:22,410
...while paying off liens on his place
on the Row to the tune of 42,000.

959
01:09:23,886 --> 01:09:26,616
Well, you see there,
you are a detective.

960
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:28,416
You dug and chinked
the metal box...

961
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:31,718
...and are enjoying the sound of it
a bit, if I'm not mistaken.

962
01:09:31,894 --> 01:09:33,225
Might still be empty.

963
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:35,386
No, it's full.

964
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:38,192
Crawling with maggots
by now, maybe...

965
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:41,632
...but still a little something they was
chewing on. Just have to look.

966
01:09:41,837 --> 01:09:44,635
Still have to find the key.
And that ain't gonna be easy.

967
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,604
Well, there's nothing easy
that means anything.

968
01:09:47,776 --> 01:09:49,573
You'll do it. I have faith.

969
01:09:51,246 --> 01:09:53,578
I like this one, Slade.

970
01:09:56,118 --> 01:10:01,420
Now, they all is yelling that I got
no right to what's on their table.

971
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:04,423
What's on their table is theirs.

972
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:08,296
I'm not trying to take it.

973
01:10:08,463 --> 01:10:11,694
"Go ahead, sit down at that table,"
I tell.

974
01:10:12,034 --> 01:10:15,470
"Have all you want to eat.
Eat till you can't eat no more.

975
01:10:15,637 --> 01:10:19,505
Now, what's left on that table...

976
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:22,838
...when you can't eat no more,
even if you tried...

977
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:28,244
...leave that there
because that's for the rest of us."

978
01:10:30,986 --> 01:10:35,150
And for that, they're trying to ruin me.

979
01:10:35,324 --> 01:10:37,849
For taking
what they left on the table...

980
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:41,518
...and using it
to build something for you!

981
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:46,461
To build 3000 miles
of paved highways...

982
01:10:46,635 --> 01:10:50,628
...a hundred and eleven new bridges,
208 new schools...

983
01:10:50,806 --> 01:10:54,367
...60,000 brand-new jobs!

984
01:10:59,915 --> 01:11:02,611
Now, they wanna ruin me...

985
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,954
...because they wanna ruin you.

986
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:14,289
But your will is my strength.

987
01:11:15,197 --> 01:11:18,655
Your need is my justice.

988
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:23,100
And I won't let them!

989
01:11:35,317 --> 01:11:38,013
It come to me in a dream.

990
01:11:38,387 --> 01:11:41,686
Whilst you were up in Savannah with
your pail and shovel, eating oysters.

991
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:43,085
What did?

992
01:11:43,725 --> 01:11:47,354
I'm gonna build me
the best-staffed, best-equipped...

993
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:50,498
...biggest goddamn health center
this state ever saw.

994
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:54,193
This country ever saw.
The All-Father hisself.

995
01:11:54,369 --> 01:11:58,305
You want me to do what
to further this noble enterprise?

996
01:11:58,473 --> 01:12:00,532
Deliver me my chief of staff.

997
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:03,507
Fine. You give me a list
of who you're thinking to run it.

998
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,112
Only one name on it:

999
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:07,445
Dr. Adam Stanton.

1000
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:11,950
That's my boy, Tom! That's the way!
You see that?

1001
01:12:12,154 --> 01:12:16,921
That's an all-American pass.
Goddamn it. Attaboy, Tom!

1002
01:12:22,764 --> 01:12:26,598
Well, somebody gotta
run this hospital.

1003
01:12:26,768 --> 01:12:29,202
He's gotta be the best, don't he?

1004
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:32,772
- Adam Stanton is not the best.
- Well, he is for what I need.

1005
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:34,909
They'll never approve
the money otherwise.

1006
01:12:35,644 --> 01:12:37,305
Willie, Adam's an old friend of mine.

1007
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,606
As I certainly know,
else I wouldn't be asking.

1008
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:41,806
I know him and I know you.
He won't do it.

1009
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:44,012
What's wrong with me?

1010
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:46,313
To him, what isn't?

1011
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,456
You're everything
his father fought against.

1012
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:50,818
He hates what you represent,
if not you yourself.

1013
01:12:51,393 --> 01:12:53,884
I'm not asking him to love me.

1014
01:12:54,062 --> 01:12:56,292
- I'm asking him to run a hospital.
- Your hospital.

1015
01:12:56,465 --> 01:12:59,832
The people's hospital, where any poor
redneck and nigger can get the best...

1016
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:02,368
...without paying a dime.
He ought to like that.

1017
01:13:02,537 --> 01:13:06,769
No. What you're asking is for him
to put his family's name next to yours.

1018
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:09,410
So you can trot him out
in front of senators and say:

1019
01:13:09,578 --> 01:13:11,944
"Lookie here,
lookie who I got standing next to me.

1020
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:15,277
The son of the most honorable man
who ever served this state."

1021
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,179
Just get him.

1022
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,158
Not easy being the son
of a great man.

1023
01:13:29,264 --> 01:13:32,358
It don't look so hard
for my boy Tom out there.

1024
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:35,966
Far as you know.

1025
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:49,012
We should go.

1026
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:53,949
Not yet. Let's go in again.

1027
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:12,466
<i>The friend of your youth...</i>

1028
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:15,909
<i>... is the only friend you'll ever have.</i>

1029
01:14:16,078 --> 01:14:18,376
<i>For he doesn't really see you.</i>

1030
01:14:20,382 --> 01:14:24,910
<i>He sees in his mind a face,
which doesn't exist anymore.</i>

1031
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:26,952
<i>And speaks a name- -</i>

1032
01:14:27,122 --> 01:14:32,856
<i>Spike, Bud, Red, Rusty, Jack.</i>

1033
01:14:33,195 --> 01:14:37,359
<i>- that belongs
to that now nonexistent face.</i>

1034
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:42,136
<i>He's still the young idealist
you used to be.</i>

1035
01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:45,770
<i>Still sees good and bad
in black and white...</i>

1036
01:14:46,108 --> 01:14:49,236
<i>... and men as sinners or saints,
but never both.</i>

1037
01:14:49,411 --> 01:14:52,437
<i>- Hey, Adam.
- Feels superior in the knowledge....</i>

1038
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,344
<i>... that you no longer
can distinguish the two.</i>

1039
01:14:55,517 --> 01:14:57,712
<i>- Jack.
- That's what drives you to it...</i>

1040
01:14:57,886 --> 01:15:00,320
<i>- ... try to stick the knife in.
- Come on in.</i>

1041
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:03,890
<i>For there's a kind
of snobbery in failure.</i>

1042
01:15:04,059 --> 01:15:07,119
<i>Like the twist
to the mouth of a drunk.</i>

1043
01:15:09,397 --> 01:15:10,762
You're looking good, Jack.

1044
01:15:10,932 --> 01:15:13,332
Thank you.
I'll take that as a compliment.

1045
01:15:16,872 --> 01:15:18,737
Been playing much?

1046
01:15:19,107 --> 01:15:20,904
Who wants to know, my sister?

1047
01:15:21,376 --> 01:15:23,503
It was just a question.

1048
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:28,942
- Everything good?
- Yes, Jack, everything's good.

1049
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:31,617
All right.
I'm gonna tell you something.

1050
01:15:31,786 --> 01:15:35,153
I don't want you to start yelling at me
until I'm finished.

1051
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:37,455
Governor Stark
wants you as director...

1052
01:15:37,626 --> 01:15:40,288
...of the medical center he's building.
Whatever you want...

1053
01:15:40,862 --> 01:15:43,330
...all you have to do is say,
it's yours.

1054
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:44,988
- Money?
- I didn't say that.

1055
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:48,864
What do I want money for?
I got everything I want. Look around.

1056
01:15:49,037 --> 01:15:50,265
I didn't say money.

1057
01:15:50,438 --> 01:15:53,271
Then what?
What's next when that doesn't work?

1058
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:55,966
- A threat of some kind?
- Of course not.

1059
01:15:56,144 --> 01:15:58,544
That's how he gets things done?
What he relies on?

1060
01:15:58,713 --> 01:16:00,271
The bribe and the threat?

1061
01:16:00,582 --> 01:16:04,518
I would never do that to you
or let anyone else. You know that.

1062
01:16:05,053 --> 01:16:07,351
I don't know what you think
he's thinking, Jack...

1063
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:10,889
...or what you're thinking,
but couldn't be flattery.

1064
01:16:11,059 --> 01:16:14,119
He's thinking what he thinks about
anybody he wants something from...

1065
01:16:14,296 --> 01:16:16,526
...who doesn't wanna give it.
- Something from their past.

1066
01:16:16,965 --> 01:16:19,991
- You just said he wasn't.
- Not their past, their weakness.

1067
01:16:20,168 --> 01:16:22,261
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

1068
01:16:22,437 --> 01:16:25,463
I'm not gonna debate it with you, Jack.
We're not in school anymore.

1069
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,871
I don't care if you know I'm right.
I don't care if I am right. But I am.

1070
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:35,372
Then what is it, Jack?
What is my weakness?

1071
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:38,910
You can't look at anybody
with something broke...

1072
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:40,645
...without wanting to fix it.

1073
01:16:40,822 --> 01:16:43,188
- And that's a weakness?
- Some would say.

1074
01:16:43,358 --> 01:16:44,586
You would say.

1075
01:16:45,627 --> 01:16:47,720
- It's no disgrace.
- Well, then tell me, Jack.

1076
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:49,921
Tell me, please.
How is that a weakness?

1077
01:16:51,433 --> 01:16:54,197
- I don't need to tell you.
- I think you do.

1078
01:16:54,369 --> 01:16:57,338
If you don't know, I'll leave you
to think about it. It'll come to you.

1079
01:16:57,505 --> 01:17:00,065
No, it won't, Jack.
And you'll have to go to your boss...

1080
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:02,836
...and tell him you failed
without taking out the big guns.

1081
01:17:03,011 --> 01:17:06,276
So tell me, for your sake,
how is that a weakness?

1082
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:09,246
Because it makes you do things
you don't wanna do.

1083
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,317
If they're good.

1084
01:17:11,486 --> 01:17:14,216
And this is. He may not be...

1085
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:16,986
...but this is.

1086
01:17:30,372 --> 01:17:32,397
It was good to see you, Adam.

1087
01:18:04,794 --> 01:18:09,049
Now, before I tell y'all the story
about how this great university...

1088
01:18:09,735 --> 01:18:12,259
...changed the life of a boy
from Mason City...

1089
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:14,879
...who, by all rights,
should still be swilling hogs...

1090
01:18:16,019 --> 01:18:19,369
...first, I'm gonna set your minds at ease
on another point of interest.

1091
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,777
I brung my checkbook with me.

1092
01:18:27,949 --> 01:18:30,963
- You own one share?
- I do. I just bought it.

1093
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:33,189
Now, that gives me the right
as a stockholder...

1094
01:18:33,202 --> 01:18:36,424
...to view the company's
equity records, doesn't it?

1095
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:47,625
Governor, sir?

1096
01:19:44,498 --> 01:19:46,432
Miss Littlepaugh?

1097
01:19:55,809 --> 01:19:57,709
You're from the insurance company.

1098
01:19:58,111 --> 01:20:00,511
No, no, I'm not.

1099
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,978
But I know about your brother's
insurance policy.

1100
01:20:05,085 --> 01:20:07,076
Not that there was much left on it
to collect.

1101
01:20:07,254 --> 01:20:10,052
He borrowed against it
almost down to nothing. Didn't he?

1102
01:20:10,457 --> 01:20:12,516
Which means you lied...

1103
01:20:12,692 --> 01:20:14,489
...for almost nothing.

1104
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:18,627
Now, don't you go
jumping out a window.

1105
01:20:19,366 --> 01:20:21,061
It wasn't the money...

1106
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,327
...it was the disgrace.

1107
01:20:23,503 --> 01:20:25,937
I wanted him buried in the good part
of the cemetery...

1108
01:20:26,606 --> 01:20:29,006
...not in the back,
with all the sinners.

1109
01:20:29,176 --> 01:20:31,303
Why did he kill himself?

1110
01:20:31,611 --> 01:20:36,571
They drove him to it.
To make room for that thief, Irwin.

1111
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:39,916
My brother went
to the Justice Department...

1112
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:43,055
...and told them he knew
all about their man Irwin...

1113
01:20:43,223 --> 01:20:44,713
...and the bribes...

1114
01:20:44,891 --> 01:20:46,222
...but they wouldn't listen.

1115
01:20:49,196 --> 01:20:52,563
- Are you lying to me?
- No, that's what killed him.

1116
01:20:52,966 --> 01:20:55,230
He wrote the letter to me
and told me.

1117
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:57,768
And then that night he... .

1118
01:20:58,738 --> 01:21:02,936
All right, wait. What letter?

1119
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,509
The letter he wrote me
explaining it all.

1120
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,080
The lawsuit Irwin was paid
to let up on...

1121
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:11,444
...and how the power company
hid the payoffs...

1122
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:15,520
...by firing my brother
and giving Irwin his job.

1123
01:21:17,357 --> 01:21:19,325
Where's the letter now?
What happened to it?

1124
01:21:19,492 --> 01:21:20,925
Oh, I have it.

1125
01:21:21,828 --> 01:21:23,261
Kept it all this time?

1126
01:21:25,999 --> 01:21:28,229
You have the letter here?

1127
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,665
<i>You bring down the lion...</i>

1128
01:21:35,842 --> 01:21:37,901
<i>... the rest of the jungle
will quake in fear...</i>

1129
01:21:38,078 --> 01:21:39,943
<i>... and they'll all fall into line.</i>

1130
01:21:42,015 --> 01:21:44,813
Your employer is calling you, Jack.

1131
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:53,450
Thank you.

1132
01:22:25,025 --> 01:22:26,458
Hello.

1133
01:22:26,726 --> 01:22:28,591
Hello, Anne.

1134
01:22:32,732 --> 01:22:35,701
- What's that?
- Orange soda.

1135
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:37,131
Two straws.

1136
01:22:38,338 --> 01:22:42,138
- I think I might want something else.
- I didn't say one of them was for you.

1137
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:45,868
It's the way it's drunk. Tradition.

1138
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:53,682
- I know you went to see Adam.
- I did. What of it?

1139
01:22:53,853 --> 01:22:55,912
What did you say to him?

1140
01:22:56,089 --> 01:23:00,150
I went there and I offered him a job.
No use blaming me.

1141
01:23:00,327 --> 01:23:02,887
- I'm not blaming you.
- Well, that's what it sounds like.

1142
01:23:03,063 --> 01:23:07,056
That's what you sound like.
If you could hear yourself.

1143
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:09,326
I want him to take it.
I want you to go back...

1144
01:23:09,502 --> 01:23:11,595
...and ask him again.

1145
01:23:12,339 --> 01:23:16,435
Jack, you know how it is.
My brother is the son of a governor...

1146
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:19,373
...the grandson of a senator,
the great-grandson of a general.

1147
01:23:19,546 --> 01:23:24,609
<i>She wasn't telling me anything
I didn't already know about Adam.</i>

1148
01:23:25,452 --> 01:23:27,750
<i>But she was doing it
walking next to me...</i>

1149
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:30,446
<i>... which is all that mattered.</i>

1150
01:23:31,491 --> 01:23:35,723
<i>So I let her go on
as long as she wanted.</i>

1151
01:23:37,797 --> 01:23:41,130
<i>I knew that Adam
had already made his decision.</i>

1152
01:23:41,301 --> 01:23:45,032
<i>He had decided to take the job
when I first brought it up.</i>

1153
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:49,266
<i>He was just putting some time
between my visit and now...</i>

1154
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,569
<i>... out of pride.</i>

1155
01:23:53,513 --> 01:23:56,038
He needs to do this
to be part of something himself...

1156
01:23:56,216 --> 01:23:57,513
...before he disappears.

1157
01:23:57,684 --> 01:24:01,313
<i>But something about
what she was saying bothered me.</i>

1158
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:04,146
<i>The way an off-stage noise
bothers you.</i>

1159
01:24:04,324 --> 01:24:05,689
What kind of life is that?

1160
01:24:05,859 --> 01:24:07,486
<i>Something you hear- -</i>

1161
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:08,888
He's a guardian of dead men.

1162
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:11,121
<i>- but not clear enough
to catch the meaning of.</i>

1163
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:14,824
I want him to take it.
He has to do it.

1164
01:24:15,001 --> 01:24:17,401
<i>So you push it aside.</i>

1165
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:27,037
I guess that's one of your gunmen
I've heard about.

1166
01:24:27,213 --> 01:24:28,441
Sugar Boy, hell, no.

1167
01:24:28,615 --> 01:24:30,810
He just carry that peashooter
for decoration.

1168
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:34,215
I tell you one thing, though.
Ain't nobody can drive like him.

1169
01:24:38,091 --> 01:24:40,355
So, what do you think, doc?

1170
01:24:41,528 --> 01:24:43,996
I think it'll do the people of the state
some good...

1171
01:24:44,164 --> 01:24:46,462
...and get you some votes.

1172
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:48,793
There's a lot of ways to get votes.
Cheaper ones.

1173
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,999
So I understand.

1174
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:54,072
Because there are some things
I understand.

1175
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,334
And some things you don't.
Just like there's some I don't.

1176
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,637
What I do know
is what makes the mare go.

1177
01:24:59,813 --> 01:25:02,145
And that you can always
make goodness out of badness.

1178
01:25:02,315 --> 01:25:05,113
- That would be two things.
- Them's the two things I know, then.

1179
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:06,513
And both of them wrong.

1180
01:25:06,686 --> 01:25:09,985
No, neither one of them, sir.
I beg your pardon.

1181
01:25:10,156 --> 01:25:13,023
You can always make good from bad,
in all things.

1182
01:25:13,393 --> 01:25:14,792
In politics, poetry...

1183
01:25:14,961 --> 01:25:17,725
...everything in between.
Makes no difference.

1184
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:20,530
A man writes a sonnet...

1185
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,565
...and it's good.

1186
01:25:22,735 --> 01:25:24,464
Is it less good if it turns out...

1187
01:25:24,637 --> 01:25:27,401
...the dame he wrote it about
is married to someone else?

1188
01:25:27,574 --> 01:25:30,338
That his passion was illicit?

1189
01:25:31,511 --> 01:25:33,741
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

1190
01:25:35,014 --> 01:25:38,279
I wouldn't mind
understanding something, actually.

1191
01:25:39,319 --> 01:25:43,619
Lf, as you say, there's only bad
to start with from conception on...

1192
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,587
...and that good must be made
from bad...

1193
01:25:45,758 --> 01:25:47,749
...then how do you ever know
what the good is?

1194
01:25:48,495 --> 01:25:51,953
Well, that's simple.
You just make it up as you go along.

1195
01:25:52,131 --> 01:25:53,359
Make up what?

1196
01:25:53,533 --> 01:25:55,364
The good. What else
are we talking about?

1197
01:25:55,835 --> 01:25:57,564
Make it up as you go along?

1198
01:25:57,737 --> 01:26:00,205
Yeah. Just like folks have been doing
for a million years.

1199
01:26:00,373 --> 01:26:02,500
Since we fall out of trees,
crawl out the swamp.

1200
01:26:02,675 --> 01:26:04,233
They just cook up what is right.

1201
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,970
If nobody likes that, well,
just cook it up again...

1202
01:26:07,146 --> 01:26:08,807
...a little different with a lid on.

1203
01:26:08,982 --> 01:26:10,210
And you know what?

1204
01:26:10,383 --> 01:26:12,943
Things under a lid
don't look no different than things...

1205
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:14,950
...not under a lid
when there's one on it.

1206
01:26:15,121 --> 01:26:17,919
You don't have to convince me
of anything, Mr. Stark.

1207
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:21,254
You've already done that.
I'm here, aren't I?

1208
01:26:21,694 --> 01:26:25,562
That's right.
And you're a good boy too, doc.

1209
01:26:25,732 --> 01:26:27,893
A lot better than you think.

1210
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:30,395
So goddamn it.

1211
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:35,131
Don't let none of them bastards
tell you no different.

1212
01:26:45,084 --> 01:26:48,144
I got a question since everybody's
trying to understand everything...

1213
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:50,016
...all of a sudden.

1214
01:26:51,157 --> 01:26:52,385
Back when we met...

1215
01:26:53,226 --> 01:26:55,217
...at Slade's old place,
when we shook hands--

1216
01:26:55,395 --> 01:26:56,953
Do you remember that moment?

1217
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,654
Like it was yesterday.

1218
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:02,460
Did you or did you not
give me a wink?

1219
01:27:02,902 --> 01:27:04,927
A wink?

1220
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:11,106
Well, that's just gonna have to remain
a mystery.

1221
01:27:11,277 --> 01:27:13,837
- You don't remember.
- Sure I do.

1222
01:27:15,148 --> 01:27:17,013
Then...?

1223
01:27:22,522 --> 01:27:24,183
You know, I... .

1224
01:27:24,357 --> 01:27:28,157
I just do recall giving you a wink.

1225
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:32,293
But then,
maybe I got something in my eye...

1226
01:27:32,465 --> 01:27:34,990
...which would make it more
of a blink.

1227
01:27:36,703 --> 01:27:38,933
Did you have something
in your eye?

1228
01:27:40,273 --> 01:27:42,298
What if I didn't?

1229
01:27:42,909 --> 01:27:44,433
What would that mean?

1230
01:27:44,744 --> 01:27:46,371
That maybe you figured
you and me...

1231
01:27:46,546 --> 01:27:49,037
...had something in common
the others didn't.

1232
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:55,451
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
and deprive you of the mystery.

1233
01:27:56,222 --> 01:28:00,716
There's just too few honest-to-God
mysteries left to go around.

1234
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,856
And long after I'm dead and gone...

1235
01:28:08,635 --> 01:28:13,595
...and long after these sons of bitches
are dead and gone...

1236
01:28:13,773 --> 01:28:17,004
...I'm talking eternally now...

1237
01:28:18,578 --> 01:28:23,538
...the Willie Stark Hospital
will still be standing.

1238
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:27,884
Where every man,
woman and child...

1239
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:31,080
...who's sick or in pain can go in...

1240
01:28:31,257 --> 01:28:34,021
...knowing they'll get
all a man can do.

1241
01:28:34,193 --> 01:28:38,789
Not as charity,
but as a right, as your right!

1242
01:28:38,965 --> 01:28:43,163
As it is that every child
shall have a complete education!

1243
01:28:43,336 --> 01:28:48,672
That no person, aged or infirm,
shall want or beg for bread!

1244
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:52,675
That no poor man's land
or house will be taxed!

1245
01:28:52,845 --> 01:28:56,042
That you shall not be deprived
of hope!

1246
01:29:02,488 --> 01:29:05,048
And if any man...

1247
01:29:05,892 --> 01:29:08,861
...stands between me...

1248
01:29:09,462 --> 01:29:11,896
...and fulfilling your rights...

1249
01:29:12,065 --> 01:29:15,159
...I will strike him down...

1250
01:29:15,334 --> 01:29:17,928
...so help me God!

1251
01:29:18,104 --> 01:29:22,473
Hip, shin, thigh and neck bone,
I will hit him.

1252
01:29:22,642 --> 01:29:25,110
I will hit him with a meat ax.

1253
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,508
Somebody give me a meat ax...

1254
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:31,138
...and bring me another one
for my friend and ally!

1255
01:29:31,718 --> 01:29:36,155
Because it's not only God's only son
with us on this one.

1256
01:29:36,322 --> 01:29:40,315
It's the son of the last
great leader of this state:

1257
01:29:40,493 --> 01:29:45,795
Governor Joe Stanton's boy,
Dr. Adam Stanton!

1258
01:30:02,749 --> 01:30:06,014
All right. See there?

1259
01:30:06,185 --> 01:30:09,586
It's not so bad.
It's not gonna kill you.

1260
01:30:30,042 --> 01:30:31,737
What's up?

1261
01:30:32,745 --> 01:30:34,110
Sadie.

1262
01:30:39,952 --> 01:30:41,943
Now he's done it.

1263
01:30:43,623 --> 01:30:46,421
He's done it again,
and I swear this time... .

1264
01:30:46,592 --> 01:30:49,322
- Done?
- Don't act so dumb.

1265
01:30:49,495 --> 01:30:52,692
Or any dumber than you are.
He's two-timing me again.

1266
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:55,356
Or four or one or whatever timing
you wanna call it...

1267
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:57,662
...because you're such a smartass.

1268
01:30:57,837 --> 01:31:00,931
- She skate?
- Shut up.

1269
01:31:01,307 --> 01:31:04,640
You and your friends.
Your highbrow friends.

1270
01:31:04,811 --> 01:31:07,006
All the money and privilege
and everything else...

1271
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:11,378
...you pretend means nothing.
To someone with it, it means nothing.

1272
01:31:13,352 --> 01:31:15,513
Don't look so dumb.
I said it annoys me.

1273
01:31:15,688 --> 01:31:18,156
I have no idea
what you're talking about...

1274
01:31:18,324 --> 01:31:21,418
...or what it was tangled you two up
in the first place, love or hate.

1275
01:31:21,594 --> 01:31:23,061
You know what I'm talking about.

1276
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:25,424
Maybe you fixed it up.
I'm sure you did.

1277
01:31:25,598 --> 01:31:27,725
Surely he's fixed you up,
like that pathetic...

1278
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,425
...crazy brother of hers,
to say thanks.

1279
01:31:30,603 --> 01:31:35,472
"Thanks, Jack.
She is a looker, I do declare.

1280
01:31:35,641 --> 01:31:38,132
I'm naming you SDP,
yes, sir.

1281
01:31:38,311 --> 01:31:41,007
State Director of Pimps."

1282
01:31:43,883 --> 01:31:45,407
What are you saying?

1283
01:31:49,121 --> 01:31:50,918
Are you saying...?

1284
01:32:01,434 --> 01:32:02,662
Thank you.

1285
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:07,568
Are you s--?

1286
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:18,676
<i>I love you.</i>

1287
01:33:36,696 --> 01:33:38,857
We're gonna walk some more.

1288
01:33:43,135 --> 01:33:44,898
All right.

1289
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:59,345
Hello.

1290
01:33:59,518 --> 01:34:00,917
Hello, Mother.

1291
01:34:01,253 --> 01:34:04,188
Yes, Mother. Yes.

1292
01:34:08,828 --> 01:34:10,523
All right.

1293
01:34:10,963 --> 01:34:12,726
All right, Mother.

1294
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:14,729
Goodbye.

1295
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:23,706
She and the Peytons
and the bridge partner...

1296
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:26,743
...are going to La Grange
for a nightcap.

1297
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:05,814
- Jackie.
- What?

1298
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,813
I came up here.

1299
01:35:28,007 --> 01:35:31,101
<i>This was years ago,
you understand.</i>

1300
01:35:32,378 --> 01:35:35,836
<i>Back when things
weren't set in concrete.</i>

1301
01:35:37,383 --> 01:35:40,978
<i>Back when you had a way
of changing the course of things.</i>

1302
01:35:41,554 --> 01:35:43,488
<i>If you knew how.</i>

1303
01:35:46,759 --> 01:35:48,886
<i>She was perfect.</i>

1304
01:35:50,029 --> 01:35:52,395
<i>She had always been perfect.</i>

1305
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:55,890
<i>I wanted to keep her that way...</i>

1306
01:35:56,669 --> 01:35:58,967
<i>... and like this.</i>

1307
01:36:00,372 --> 01:36:03,364
<i>To be young and older...</i>

1308
01:36:04,043 --> 01:36:05,806
<i>... somehow.</i>

1309
01:36:10,783 --> 01:36:14,241
<i>Of course that's not
what it looked like to her.</i>

1310
01:36:17,656 --> 01:36:19,783
<i>When I came home
from school at Christmas...</i>

1311
01:36:19,959 --> 01:36:22,223
<i>... we saw each other, of course.</i>

1312
01:36:22,394 --> 01:36:25,727
<i>We talked about things,
but never that.</i>

1313
01:36:25,898 --> 01:36:28,731
<i>We talked about love in general.</i>

1314
01:36:28,901 --> 01:36:32,667
<i>Like it was the subject of an essay
instead of real.</i>

1315
01:36:33,939 --> 01:36:38,842
<i>She said it was like jumping off
the high dive, love was.</i>

1316
01:36:39,278 --> 01:36:42,213
<i>Or like almost getting drowned.</i>

1317
01:36:42,681 --> 01:36:44,512
<i>Which, honestly,
I didn't understand.</i>

1318
01:36:46,385 --> 01:36:48,478
<i>For a long time.</i>

1319
01:36:52,725 --> 01:36:55,956
<i>You wanna know the reason
I stopped that night?</i>

1320
01:36:56,629 --> 01:36:58,927
<i>It wasn't nobility.</i>

1321
01:36:59,098 --> 01:37:01,566
<i>That's only what I told myself.</i>

1322
01:37:01,967 --> 01:37:04,959
We have all the time
in the world, right?

1323
01:37:12,945 --> 01:37:15,709
<i>It was that I knew something
was about to be taken from us...</i>

1324
01:37:16,782 --> 01:37:21,151
<i>... leaving in its place
something we didn't know.</i>

1325
01:37:22,454 --> 01:37:25,014
<i>Which didn't make her sad...</i>

1326
01:37:25,991 --> 01:37:27,959
<i>... but it did me.</i>

1327
01:37:29,929 --> 01:37:34,332
<i>You only get a couple of moments
that determine your life.</i>

1328
01:37:35,501 --> 01:37:37,799
<i>Sometimes only one.</i>

1329
01:37:39,338 --> 01:37:41,203
<i>And then it's gone.</i>

1330
01:37:44,476 --> 01:37:46,205
<i>Forever.</i>

1331
01:37:49,181 --> 01:37:52,048
I talked to Senator Loden
this morning.

1332
01:37:52,218 --> 01:37:55,119
He said you find something nice
to put on his plate...

1333
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:58,586
...he might come around.
Vote any way you like.

1334
01:37:58,757 --> 01:38:00,748
While you cut yourself a slice.

1335
01:38:01,527 --> 01:38:03,961
- I ain't saying that.
- I know what you're saying, Tiny.

1336
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:06,324
You know, I'd rather bust a man
than buy him.

1337
01:38:07,066 --> 01:38:11,730
- Well, that's up to you now.
- Yeah, sure is. Now go on. Get.

1338
01:38:22,948 --> 01:38:26,406
Do you have
any information for me?

1339
01:38:29,121 --> 01:38:31,783
You sure there's not something
you neglected to mention?

1340
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:33,822
Something you forgot?

1341
01:38:35,861 --> 01:38:37,419
Jack.

1342
01:38:39,431 --> 01:38:40,898
No.

1343
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,090
Nothing.

1344
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,603
Nothing. Well.

1345
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:51,508
How about that, Sugar? Nothing.
Am I alone in this?

1346
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:53,577
The bastards
are pounding at the gate...

1347
01:38:53,746 --> 01:38:56,340
...they're gonna put a vote
of impeachment on the calendar!

1348
01:38:56,515 --> 01:38:58,847
They take that vote today, I'm out!

1349
01:39:04,056 --> 01:39:06,923
I need Judge Irwin with me.

1350
01:39:08,127 --> 01:39:10,891
Or at least not against me.

1351
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,962
So whatever it is...

1352
01:39:19,238 --> 01:39:21,331
...that you don't have on him...

1353
01:39:25,811 --> 01:39:27,540
...use it.

1354
01:39:31,016 --> 01:39:33,450
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1355
01:39:33,619 --> 01:39:36,452
I said I'm going over to the judge's.

1356
01:39:37,222 --> 01:39:41,158
Well, you mean later.
He'll be napping this time of day.

1357
01:39:41,327 --> 01:39:43,261
There isn't any time
he'll wanna hear...

1358
01:39:43,429 --> 01:39:44,726
...what I have to tell him.

1359
01:39:46,498 --> 01:39:49,092
He's not well, you know.

1360
01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:53,104
I can't help that.

1361
01:39:54,473 --> 01:39:57,203
I do wish
you wouldn't get mixed up in things.

1362
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:00,840
It isn't me mixed up in them.

1363
01:40:01,714 --> 01:40:03,579
The judge is napping right now,
Mr. Burden.

1364
01:40:03,749 --> 01:40:06,309
I'll wait in his study
until he comes down.

1365
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:20,023
Fire this marble.

1366
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,434
Watch the chandelier.

1367
01:40:25,137 --> 01:40:26,604
Okay, you can fire.

1368
01:40:29,308 --> 01:40:32,903
Hello, Jack. I didn't know
you were at your mother's.

1369
01:40:33,078 --> 01:40:34,568
- You just get in?
- Last night.

1370
01:40:35,114 --> 01:40:39,346
Yeah. It's a bit early in the day,
but what do you think?

1371
01:40:39,518 --> 01:40:42,385
A touch of bourbon
never hurt anyone.

1372
01:40:42,554 --> 01:40:43,782
Least not you and me.

1373
01:40:44,022 --> 01:40:47,389
We're indestructible, aren't we,
you and me?

1374
01:40:47,559 --> 01:40:50,221
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks," he says.

1375
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:53,359
Begging the question,
as the old man pours just one drink...

1376
01:40:53,532 --> 01:40:55,261
...what's on your mind?

1377
01:40:56,902 --> 01:40:58,631
Out with it.

1378
01:40:59,204 --> 01:41:01,035
You know who I work for.

1379
01:41:01,206 --> 01:41:02,571
How could I forget?

1380
01:41:03,008 --> 01:41:06,034
But let's just sit
and pretend that I have.

1381
01:41:06,278 --> 01:41:07,643
Come sit over here with me.

1382
01:41:19,825 --> 01:41:22,293
The truth is I don't hold
the same low opinion of him...

1383
01:41:22,461 --> 01:41:24,053
...as many of our friends
on the Row.

1384
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:25,753
I was almost for him at one time.

1385
01:41:25,931 --> 01:41:30,891
He was busting out windowpanes
and, yeah, letting in some fresh air.

1386
01:41:31,069 --> 01:41:35,199
But now I am worried about him
knocking down the whole house.

1387
01:41:35,374 --> 01:41:38,207
So you threw in with his enemies
after you said you wouldn't.

1388
01:41:38,377 --> 01:41:39,901
Oh, Jack.

1389
01:41:40,112 --> 01:41:42,137
What is politics
but a matter of choices?

1390
01:41:42,314 --> 01:41:45,078
You make a choice knowing there's
a chance it's the wrong one.

1391
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:48,378
You've made a choice
and you know how much it's cost you.

1392
01:41:48,554 --> 01:41:50,852
There's always a price
for everything we do.

1393
01:41:52,257 --> 01:41:55,021
When we came by that night
and were leaving...

1394
01:41:55,194 --> 01:41:56,786
...you said you would think
about it.

1395
01:41:56,962 --> 01:41:59,897
About calling off the dogs?
No, I did not say that.

1396
01:42:00,065 --> 01:42:02,898
Your memory is faulty, sir.
He said, "Think about it"...

1397
01:42:03,068 --> 01:42:04,296
...which I don't have to.

1398
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:06,734
I don't have to think
about things I already know.

1399
01:42:06,905 --> 01:42:09,499
You should think it over.
Even now...

1400
01:42:09,675 --> 01:42:12,473
...because it's not too late.

1401
01:42:16,348 --> 01:42:18,213
Too late for what?

1402
01:42:22,254 --> 01:42:23,846
Hey, Jack.

1403
01:42:24,656 --> 01:42:26,214
Jesus.

1404
01:42:26,925 --> 01:42:29,393
- What is it?
- Just say you'll back Stark...

1405
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:31,324
...against these attacks.
- No!

1406
01:42:36,735 --> 01:42:39,568
Now, that has the sound of finality,
don't it?

1407
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:42,434
- Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

1408
01:43:12,838 --> 01:43:15,773
You know,
I find this difficult to believe.

1409
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,806
For me too.

1410
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:21,902
And that your boss would even think
he could pressure me.

1411
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,570
Could blackmail me.

1412
01:43:23,815 --> 01:43:28,843
- The first word is better.
- The first word is prettier, not better.

1413
01:43:29,888 --> 01:43:34,484
Don't you know that this stuff
wouldn't stand up? Not in any court.

1414
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,958
It happened almost 25 years ago.

1415
01:43:37,129 --> 01:43:38,619
You couldn't get any testimony...

1416
01:43:39,331 --> 01:43:41,891
...except from that woman
who is related...

1417
01:43:42,067 --> 01:43:45,764
...and whose testimony,
if she gave it...

1418
01:43:46,038 --> 01:43:48,063
...would be worthless.

1419
01:43:49,141 --> 01:43:51,837
And everybody else, Jack...

1420
01:43:53,412 --> 01:43:55,710
...everybody else is dead.

1421
01:43:56,915 --> 01:43:58,610
You're not.

1422
01:43:59,184 --> 01:44:02,153
You're not dead.
And you don't live in any court.

1423
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:05,518
You live in the world, where people
think you're a certain kind of man.

1424
01:44:05,691 --> 01:44:07,682
I am a certain kind of man.

1425
01:44:18,303 --> 01:44:21,602
You know, when I was a kid
it seemed natural...

1426
01:44:21,773 --> 01:44:24,537
...that a grown man
would stay up nights with catgut...

1427
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:28,510
...and steel wire, pliers and scissors,
and make little catapults.

1428
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,807
Read books about them.

1429
01:44:36,788 --> 01:44:38,187
Will you change your mind?

1430
01:44:42,661 --> 01:44:45,221
You know, I could hurt you, Jack.

1431
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:47,694
Like you're trying to hurt me.

1432
01:44:48,233 --> 01:44:50,463
I could say something.

1433
01:44:51,069 --> 01:44:53,230
I could tell you something...

1434
01:44:53,405 --> 01:44:55,339
...that would hurt.

1435
01:45:01,847 --> 01:45:03,371
But I won't.

1436
01:45:07,152 --> 01:45:09,279
Think it over. I'll be by tomorrow.

1437
01:45:09,454 --> 01:45:11,979
My mind's made up now.

1438
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:16,354
I'll come back tomorrow.

1439
01:45:20,766 --> 01:45:22,791
Made up now.

1440
01:45:59,504 --> 01:46:02,701
Mother. Mother.

1441
01:46:03,742 --> 01:46:07,542
- Mother. Mama.
- You! You! You did it!

1442
01:46:07,713 --> 01:46:09,408
- What?
- You killed him!

1443
01:46:09,581 --> 01:46:10,946
- Who?
- You killed him.

1444
01:46:11,116 --> 01:46:12,777
- Mother, who?
- You killed him.

1445
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:14,475
- Who?
- You killed him!

1446
01:46:14,653 --> 01:46:16,518
- Who, M--?
- You killed him! You killed him!

1447
01:46:16,688 --> 01:46:17,916
- Who, Mother?
- Your father!

1448
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:19,421
You killed your father!

1449
01:47:07,506 --> 01:47:10,270
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
saith the Lord.

1450
01:47:10,442 --> 01:47:13,070
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead...

1451
01:47:13,245 --> 01:47:15,270
...yet shall he live.

1452
01:47:15,447 --> 01:47:18,507
Whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die."

1453
01:47:18,683 --> 01:47:20,150
I know that my redeemer liveth...

1454
01:47:20,318 --> 01:47:22,718
...and that he shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

1455
01:47:23,989 --> 01:47:27,584
And though this body be destroyed,
yet shall I see God...

1456
01:47:27,759 --> 01:47:29,226
...and I shall see for myself...

1457
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:33,155
...and mine eyes shall behold,
and not as a stranger.

1458
01:47:33,331 --> 01:47:35,595
We brought nothing
into this world...

1459
01:47:35,767 --> 01:47:38,793
...and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.

1460
01:48:11,703 --> 01:48:16,800
- The city of God, the holy place
of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.

1461
01:48:18,276 --> 01:48:20,335
God is in the midst of her.

1462
01:48:20,512 --> 01:48:23,242
Therefore,
shall she not be removed.

1463
01:48:30,989 --> 01:48:32,684
- In every good work to do his will...

1464
01:48:34,259 --> 01:48:35,954
...working in you that which
is well pleasing in his sight...

1465
01:48:36,127 --> 01:48:41,224
...through Jesus Christ to whom
be glory forever and ever. Amen.

1466
01:49:03,488 --> 01:49:05,956
I told you to scare him,
not scare him to death.

1467
01:49:06,124 --> 01:49:09,457
- He wasn't scared.
- Then why did he do it?

1468
01:49:10,061 --> 01:49:12,655
- Jack?
- I don't wanna discuss it.

1469
01:49:12,931 --> 01:49:14,193
Well, let me just say this.

1470
01:49:14,366 --> 01:49:16,800
I know that he was some kind of
friend of the family...

1471
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:20,267
...growing up, all that, so I'm sorry
the old bastard shot himself...

1472
01:49:20,438 --> 01:49:22,906
...but we still got MacMurphy
and his boys to deal with.

1473
01:49:23,074 --> 01:49:25,167
And that didn't work out
the way we hoped.

1474
01:49:25,343 --> 01:49:27,811
You need to get someone else
for all of it. I'm through.

1475
01:49:27,979 --> 01:49:30,243
Through with it or with me?

1476
01:49:30,582 --> 01:49:32,447
I don't wanna discuss it.

1477
01:49:39,257 --> 01:49:43,159
<i>After any great trauma or crisis...</i>

1478
01:49:43,695 --> 01:49:46,596
<i>... after the shock subsides
and the nerves stop twitching...</i>

1479
01:49:47,766 --> 01:49:50,234
<i>... you settle down
to the new condition of things...</i>

1480
01:49:50,402 --> 01:49:53,530
<i>... because you know that all possibility
of any more change...</i>

1481
01:49:53,705 --> 01:49:55,468
<i>... has been used up.</i>

1482
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:57,938
<i>You've seen the pattern finally...</i>

1483
01:49:58,109 --> 01:50:02,170
<i>... because you've stepped back far
enough to take in the whole picture.</i>

1484
01:50:03,982 --> 01:50:08,419
<i>But it's too late now to do anything
but accommodate yourself to it.</i>

1485
01:50:09,087 --> 01:50:11,021
<i>And that's it.</i>

1486
01:50:11,489 --> 01:50:14,890
<i>There's nothing left to do or say...</i>

1487
01:50:15,226 --> 01:50:18,821
<i>... except that God and nothing
have a lot in common.</i>

1488
01:50:20,065 --> 01:50:21,692
<i>The end.</i>

1489
01:50:23,835 --> 01:50:26,827
<i>What you don't know
is that you're wrong.</i>

1490
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:33,134
Oh, God, Jack.

1491
01:50:38,483 --> 01:50:40,314
You've gotta help me.

1492
01:50:40,485 --> 01:50:43,283
He's crazy. He came to see me,
said the most terrible things. . .

1493
01:50:43,455 --> 01:50:46,754
...and then he walked out.
- Who? Willie?

1494
01:50:46,925 --> 01:50:48,950
No, Adam.

1495
01:50:49,194 --> 01:50:51,560
He said it was my fault.

1496
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:54,494
- Everything was my fault.
- Well... .

1497
01:50:54,666 --> 01:50:56,463
Someone called him...

1498
01:50:56,634 --> 01:50:58,659
...and told him...

1499
01:50:59,904 --> 01:51:01,838
...about me.

1500
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:04,240
About you?

1501
01:51:05,844 --> 01:51:07,971
About you and the governor.
You can say it, Anne.

1502
01:51:08,146 --> 01:51:10,740
It doesn't hurt any more to hear it
than to know it.

1503
01:51:11,549 --> 01:51:13,039
He told him what I'd done...

1504
01:51:13,218 --> 01:51:15,880
...and he said that I'd do anything
to help the governor...

1505
01:51:16,054 --> 01:51:17,988
...get what he wanted.
Even if that meant...

1506
01:51:18,156 --> 01:51:20,852
...sacrificing my brother
to some kind of fraud.

1507
01:51:22,627 --> 01:51:24,857
Which is all the hospital was.

1508
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:27,931
Nothing but a scheme to rob the state.

1509
01:51:28,099 --> 01:51:29,930
And that when the truth came out...

1510
01:51:30,101 --> 01:51:33,264
...and it would,
Adam would take the blame.

1511
01:51:33,438 --> 01:51:38,171
He'd go to prison. For every scheme
needs a fall guy and he's it.

1512
01:51:38,343 --> 01:51:41,972
- Whoever said that is lying.
- I know.

1513
01:51:42,147 --> 01:51:46,015
I tried to tell him that's not the way
it was. That he was wrong.

1514
01:51:46,184 --> 01:51:47,412
But he wouldn't listen.

1515
01:51:47,585 --> 01:51:51,043
He grabbed me and said
that he would not be made a fool.

1516
01:51:51,423 --> 01:51:53,789
That everything else
could be filthy and corrupt...

1517
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:56,654
...but that a man didn't have to be.

1518
01:51:58,296 --> 01:52:00,696
And then he said that...

1519
01:52:02,133 --> 01:52:05,830
...he wouldn't be a paid pimp
to his sister's whore.

1520
01:52:12,911 --> 01:52:15,072
He said that to me.

1521
01:52:17,782 --> 01:52:19,579
Well, neither will I.

1522
01:52:27,325 --> 01:52:28,656
Why did you do it?

1523
01:52:29,327 --> 01:52:32,763
- You knew what it would do to me.
- It had nothing to do with you.

1524
01:52:32,931 --> 01:52:34,296
- Then what?
- I don't know!

1525
01:52:34,466 --> 01:52:37,060
- Well, you better think of something!
- I wasn't thinking--!

1526
01:52:37,235 --> 01:52:38,600
Yes, you were! Yes, you were.

1527
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:40,897
Was it because of me
or in spite of me?

1528
01:52:41,072 --> 01:52:42,767
I'd never hurt you like that.

1529
01:52:43,208 --> 01:52:45,972
You would and you have.

1530
01:52:55,753 --> 01:52:58,813
Oh, God, Jack.
You have to help me.

1531
01:53:00,825 --> 01:53:03,521
I'm afraid Adam's gonna
do something to himself.

1532
01:53:33,525 --> 01:53:34,753
Adam?

1533
01:53:50,909 --> 01:53:52,710
Dear God, you are the unseen Lord
of this chamber...

1534
01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:55,338
Dear God, you are the unseen Lord
of this chamber...

1535
01:53:56,147 --> 01:53:57,546
...the silent listener...

1536
01:53:57,715 --> 01:53:59,910
...the judge of our deliberations.

1537
01:54:00,785 --> 01:54:03,151
<i>Bless the senators you sit among.</i>

1538
01:54:03,321 --> 01:54:06,222
<i>We place our trust
in your guidance.</i>

1539
01:54:06,391 --> 01:54:07,858
<i>You are our Lord and Savior.</i>

1540
01:54:08,393 --> 01:54:10,361
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

1541
01:54:11,963 --> 01:54:14,625
<i>All persons are commanded
to keep silent...</i>

1542
01:54:14,799 --> 01:54:16,926
<i>- ... on pain of imprisonment...
- Adam!</i>

1543
01:54:17,101 --> 01:54:20,036
...while the Senate
of the state of Louisiana...

1544
01:54:20,205 --> 01:54:25,142
<i>... sits for the trial
of the articles of impeachment...</i>

1545
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:31,146
<i>... against the honorable William
Stark, governor of state of Louisiana.</i>

1546
01:54:31,849 --> 01:54:34,613
I'll go up and make some calls.

1547
01:54:40,058 --> 01:54:41,286
Anne...

1548
01:54:47,365 --> 01:54:49,856
...I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

1549
01:55:05,116 --> 01:55:07,584
<i>- Mr. Gidr.
- Nay.</i>

1550
01:55:07,785 --> 01:55:10,811
<i>- Mr. Honor.
- Yea.</i>

1551
01:55:10,989 --> 01:55:13,150
<i>- Mr. Hobbes.
- Nay.</i>

1552
01:55:14,225 --> 01:55:17,626
<i>- Mr. Landmark.
- Nay.</i>

1553
01:55:17,795 --> 01:55:21,094
- Mr. Latch.
- Yea.

1554
01:55:21,266 --> 01:55:24,758
- Mr. Mouton.
- Nay.

1555
01:55:25,169 --> 01:55:27,000
- Mr. Pelerant.
- Nay.

1556
01:55:29,173 --> 01:55:32,336
<i>- Mr. Rivette.
- Yea.</i>

1557
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:36,503
- Mr. Rousseau.
- Nay.

1558
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:39,445
- Mr. Savoir.
- Nay.

1559
01:55:40,051 --> 01:55:43,179
<i>- Mr. Tesh.
- Nay.</i>

1560
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:51,122
<i>Seventeen yeas, 22 nays.</i>

1561
01:55:51,296 --> 01:55:55,665
<i>The impeachment
of Governor Willie Stark fails.</i>

1562
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:59,462
There is a line between
what is acceptable and what is not.

1563
01:55:59,637 --> 01:56:03,004
Now, the governor has stepped over
that line to guide this vote...

1564
01:56:03,174 --> 01:56:05,335
...using means
that are inappropriate.

1565
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:08,638
Now, I'll call that undue influence.

1566
01:56:08,813 --> 01:56:11,941
I'll go further, I'll call it coercion.

1567
01:56:12,116 --> 01:56:14,175
Mr. MacMurphy!

1568
01:56:17,555 --> 01:56:20,718
You say every word
but the one you mean, sir!

1569
01:56:21,492 --> 01:56:25,121
Go ahead, say it out loud.
We're all friends here.

1570
01:56:25,697 --> 01:56:30,862
But I blackmailed nobody,
to be factual!

1571
01:56:31,035 --> 01:56:32,935
I merely gave you
the opportunity to act...

1572
01:56:33,104 --> 01:56:35,095
...in accordance
with your own nature...

1573
01:56:35,273 --> 01:56:40,609
...and like all good men,
rise above principle.

1574
01:56:45,850 --> 01:56:47,442
Jack!

1575
01:57:14,512 --> 01:57:17,845
We did it! We did it, boy!
We stopped that clock!

1576
01:57:18,015 --> 01:57:19,642
Ain't gonna be
no impeachment today!

1577
01:57:27,725 --> 01:57:30,660
<i>Someone called him, Adam.</i>

1578
01:57:30,828 --> 01:57:33,922
And said that I'd do anything to
help the governor get what he wanted.

1579
01:57:34,098 --> 01:57:38,125
Even if that meant sacrificing
my brother to some kind of fraud.

1580
01:57:38,803 --> 01:57:40,862
<i>Which is all the hospital was.</i>

1581
01:57:41,038 --> 01:57:43,506
<i>Nothing but a scheme
to rob the state.</i>

1582
01:57:43,674 --> 01:57:45,608
<i>Adam would take the blame.</i>

1583
01:57:45,777 --> 01:57:50,305
<i>He'd go to prison. For every scheme
needs a fall guy and he's it.</i>

1584
01:57:53,518 --> 01:57:55,281
<i>That's not true.</i>

1585
01:57:56,888 --> 01:57:58,788
<i>Whoever said that is lying.</i>

1586
01:58:06,898 --> 01:58:09,924
Hey, doc. Where you been?
You been out there swimming?

1587
02:00:43,788 --> 02:00:47,349
<i>So listen to me. Listen here...</i>

1588
02:00:47,525 --> 02:00:49,049
<i>... and lift your eyes...</i>

1589
02:00:49,226 --> 02:00:53,526
<i>... and look on the God's blessed
and unflyblown truth:</i>

1590
02:00:53,698 --> 02:00:58,863
<i>You are a hick and ain't nobody
never helped a hick but a hick hisself.</i>

1591
02:00:59,036 --> 02:01:04,030
<i>It's up to you
to nail these parasites up.</i>

1592
02:01:04,542 --> 02:01:08,740
<i>Up to you and me and God.</i>

1593
02:01:08,913 --> 02:01:11,939
- Nail up Joe Harrison!
- Nail him up!

1594
02:01:12,116 --> 02:01:14,676
- Nail up MacMurphy!
- Nail him up!

1595
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:18,117
And nail up any bastard
that gets between you...

1596
02:01:18,289 --> 02:01:20,621
...and the roads and the bridges
and the schools...

1597
02:01:20,791 --> 02:01:25,125
...and the food you need.
You give me the hammer and I'll do it.

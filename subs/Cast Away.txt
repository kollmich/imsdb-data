destroy us or keep us warm.That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.Because we live or we die
by the clock.We never turn our back
on it.And we never, ever
allow ourselves...the sin of losing track
of time!Locally, it's 1:56.That means we've got
three hours and four minutes...before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.<i>- That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have...
- [Translating]</i>Before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster...tries to put us
out of business.Hey, Nicolai. Hey.
Nicolai, good to see you.How are you, kid?
Look what you did.You just delivered
your very first FedEx package.That deserves something special,
like a Snickers bar...and a C.D. Player.And something to listen to...
a C.D. There.Elvis Presley.
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.You all recognize this,
don't you?I took the liberty
of sending this to myself.I FedEx'd it
before I left Memphis.You're probably wondering
what could be in here.What could it possibly be?
Is it architectural plans?Maybe technical drawings?Is this the new wallpaper
for the... for the bathroom?<i>[Translator Continues]</i>It is... a clock,which I started
at absolute zero...and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.From Memphis, America
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.This is just an egg timer!What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheck?<i>- Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?
- [Translating]</i>Eighty-seven hours
is an eternity.The cosmos was created
in less time!Wars have been fought and
nations toppled in 87 hours!Fortunes made and squandered.[Translating]<i>What?</i>What are you saying
about me?I tell them,
what do they expect?This man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle
to do his delivery.I borrowed it!
I borrowed a kid's bike.And I got my packages delivered,
and that is what you people
are gonna have to start doing.You have to start doing
whatever it takes, because
in three hours and two minutes...every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck...and on its way
to the airport.<i>- [Bell Rings]
- Fifteen minutes!</i>- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.Go!
Crunch, crunch, crunch!- We have a big problem.
- What?- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What do you mean?- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?It's stuck! The most important truck...
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.All right, all right, all right.
Let's put the table right here.We'll just do the sort.Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.Let's go. Unload...
Get him out of there.Right here.
Two lines, two lines.One to the airport truck,
one to the Moscow truck.Got it?C.D.G., F.E., M. E,
Memphis on the airport truck.
Everything else right there.Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock.

- [Chuck]
Hello, Kelly. Are you there?Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up. You're not there.<i>You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin'

The bad news is...I gotta go to
the dentist this week.I got something in there
that's hurtin'.I love you and I'm gonna see you soon,
and you know what that means.Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock![Speaking French]- [Knocking]
- I absolutely, positively
have to get to Memphis tonight.Can't help you.
Try U.P.S.With this extra head wind, are we gonna
be able to push it and make the sort?- We'll do our best.
- "Our best," huh?Gwen, is there something wrong
with our doctors thatJack
keeps getting certified to fly?- Aren't you concerned?
- I'm terrified.But a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal. Relentless!What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle...- when his truck broke down?
- I borrowed it.But I love that
the kid's now crippled.So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?Two minutes.
Actually, it was less than that.The plane wasn't that heavy.
You could've added some fuel,picked up the speed
and made up the time.It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.Tomorrow's will be four minutes late,
and then six minutes
and eight minutes late.- Next thing you know,
we're the U.S. Mail.
- Yeah, well...All I'm sayin' is, if you'd
gotten all those trucks on the plane,those Russkies would be
walking on water right now.Hey, don't...
Don't gimme that look.- It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?
- Yeah.It's like a 1992
full-bodied grape juice.I see no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.We'd offer you some but, you know,
somebody's got to fly the plane.Yeah, well,
I "just say no," right?Listen, Stan,
I've been meaning to ask you.How's Mary?Oh. Uh, well,- we really don't know anything yet.
- Mm-hmm.Uh, she went to
the doctor yesterday, and, uh,it hasn't meta...
metastasized...as far as they
can tell right now.It's just kind of
wait and see.I'm so sorry.Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.I want you to know, Stan,
we are all thinking about her and you.<i>- And just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.</i><i>[Answering Machine] Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>Otherwise, leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.Stan.Listen.
Uh, I heard about this...I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.Uh, he's supposed to be
the absolute best.He worked on
Frank Toretta's wife.Frank Toretta is
a systems analyst.He played center field for us.
You know him.In the softball tournament
last Labor Day.Anyway, beside the point.Uh, what I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number...the doctor...
and, uh,you know,
put you all together and...You know, you could
get this thing fixed.You could beat it.Thanks, Chuck.
[Sighs]So, I'll get his number.<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>[Knocking]- Is Kelly Frears around?

when are you gonna make
an honest woman out of Kelly?<i>[Excited Chattering]</i>- How long?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.- You won. I owe you $5.
- So I win.- Way before the pie.
- I told him on the way up.Right about the time
the pie came out, the marriage...Kelly is still recovering from her
failed relationship with that parolee.He was a lawyer.I knew it had something to do
with raising your right hand...and swearing
to tell the truth.<i>Remember when he fell on the sidewalk
and broke his shoulder
at the wedding reception?</i>He tripped on a curb
holding a door open for me.<i>- Aunt Kelly was married before?
- [Kelly]
It's not even worth remembering.</i>So since her failed marriage
to the parolee...- Oh, my God.
- Kelly can't see being with a man
who wears a pager to bed.What're you gonna
attach it to, Hoss?<i>When you wear it to bed, I hope
you got one of those things...</i>that go vibratin'.Watch it.
I'm not touching that.<i>Oh, did you
hit an olive pit?</i><i>- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.</i><i>[Guests Chattering]</i>- Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, well,- then I am.

until we're into March and April,which is our best chances for

475 feet of good rope.Now, if we average
15 feet a day...Plus, we have to build it,we have to stock it,
we have to launch it.That's gonna be tight.That is not much time.But we...We live and we die by time,

she lost you,and now dealing

It's very emotional for her.<i>She's...</i><i>She's... sort of lost.</i>Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.Anyway, uh,I'm sorry that...[Inaudible]Okay, people, let's go.Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.<i>[Maynard] You're definitely
gonna have to go down to the DMV.</i>Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.- I have to brief this man

bright and early in the morning.- Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.Take care.- Good night.
- Good night.You got everything
you need? Okay.Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it,and I'll see you
in the morning.Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.<i>- Bring you back to life, man.
- [Becca] Bye, Chuck.</i>- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.How long are you
gonna be, man?Well...- how long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.I'm awake.I saw your taxi drive up.Get in here
out of the rain.I saw you
down at the hub today,so I know you were down there.Let me get you a towel.They're sleeping.If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.It's a nice house.Yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.What's your daughter's name?<i>Katie.</i>Katie.<i>- She's a beautiful little girl.

one thing straight here.We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?[Sighs, Chuckles]Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.<i>First they were the Oilers,

are the Tennessee Titans?Yeah.But that's not all.They went to the Super Bowl
last year.<i>- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.</i>They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.I got whole milk,

and that's what you like.</i>That'll do fine.What happened to you
becoming a professor?You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?When you, um...When your plane went down,everything just sort of
got put on hold.I think about
taking it up again, though.I came out here
to give you this.Oh, my God.I'm sorry it doesn't work.And I, uh,
I kept the picture.It was all faded anyway.I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.<i>That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.</i>They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.So here's where
that ship found you.You drifted about 500 miles.This is where
your island was,about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.And these are
the search grids.Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.I never should've
gotten on that plane.I never should've
gotten out of the car.I wanna show you something.Come here.This is...
This is our car.You kept our car.All right, now,
this is weird.It's a good car.Had a lot of memories
in this car.Two very nice memories.Oh, that trip
down to the Gulf, yeah.So, can I drive it?It's your car.That's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.Um...Let me get some stuff
out of the back.You think you're gonna
have more kids?I don't know.It's kind of confusing
right now.Well, you should.I mean, really,
you should.I would.So, what now?I don't know.I really don't know.[Starts Engine]You said
you'd be right back.I'm so sorry.Me too.Chuck!Chuck!Chuck!I always knew you were alive.I knew it.But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...that I had to let you go.I love you.You're the love of my life.I love you too, Kelly.More than you'll ever know.Chuck?You have to go home.We both had done
the math, and...Kelly added it all up.She knew she had
to let me go.I added it up,
knew that I'd...I'd lost her.'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.I was gonna die there,totally alone.I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.The only choice I had,the only thing
I could control...was when and how...and where
that was gonna happen.So... I made a rope.And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.But I had to test it,
you know?Of course.
You know me.And the weight of the log...snapped the limb
of the tree.So l-l...I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.I had power over nothing.And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.I knew...somehow...that I had to stay alive.Somehow.I had to keep breathing,even though there was
no reason to hope.And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.So that's what I did.I stayed alive.I kept breathing.And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,because the tide...came in,
gave me a sail.And now, here I am.I'm back...in Memphis, talking to you.I have ice in my glass.And I've lost her
all over again.I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.And I know
what I have to do now.I gotta keep breathing.Because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.Who knows what the tide
could bring?<i>[Elvis Presley]

- I do?Where are you headed?Well, I was just about
to figure that out.Well, that's 83 South.<i>And this road here will
hook you up with l-40 East.</i>If you turn right,that'll take you to
Amarillo, Flagstaff,California.And if you head back
that direction,<i>you'll find a whole lotta nothin'
all the way to Canada.</i>I got it.All right, then.Good luck, cowboy.<i>- [Starts Engine]

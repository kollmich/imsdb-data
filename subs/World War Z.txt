<i>This is J.T.L. Morning News.</i><i>This is Holly Chadwick.</i><i>Thanks for joining us.</i><i>We have a great show
in store for you this morning.</i><i>Well, it's a great morning
to be in the studio.</i><i>Authorities have confirmed
an avian flu outbreak.</i><i>Forecast, cloudy skies...</i><i>Good morning. Reporting from Brighton.</i><i>This will be a different scenario</i><i>if the virus changes in a way that allows
transmission between humans.</i><i>So, let's get started.</i><i>Yet again today,</i><i>another group of dolphins

real threats that you know of?</i><i>Not at all.</i><i>Environmentalists are trying</i><i>to determine the cause of death.</i><i>At alert level six,</i><i>W. H. O. guidelines for governments...</i><i>Your socks are so cute! I like them.</i><i>Police say they've seen
similar cases recently</i><i>of people behaving strangely.</i><i>The U. N. health agency is not likely</i><i>to recommend official travel restrictions.</i><i>It's a little bit unsettling.</i><i>They're not physicists.

about a doomsday is a big hoax.</i><i>The subject growled at him</i><i>and continued to maul the victim.</i><i>The best estimate
is about 15,000 in the U. K.</i><i>We don't know if this is spreading.</i><i>Rhythms of change...</i><i>So far there's no manifestation.</i><i>Monitors have arrived,
even carrying them...</i><i>With that much
public at risk, we cannot...</i><i>They're trying to move us on,

our old apartment on 72nd.Need anything, Karin?Water.I'll organize.Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?Baby. Go talk somewhere else.Okay.The President is dead.Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.Reports of gun battles
in the streets of the capital.Your parties are panicking.The bigger cities are the worst off.The airlines
were the perfect delivery system.<i>Carnival cruise vessel Dream
has been given permission to join.</i><i>Twenty seven knots south and closing.</i>How soon are they showing
symptoms after contact?The provisional
government currently considersnorthern Minnesota
to be a potential safe zone.Have you recorded any instance where
a person was bitten but not infected?How the hell do I know
if Russia's fallen?Sir, I cannot action that order.Colonel, I'm sorry,
but we cannot facilitatean evacuation for you or your men.Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.Malnutrition. Dirty water.No gas for the winter or transportation.No bullets to fight.And it has spread
to all corners of the globe.The question
that we have got to addressis what the hell is it?About 5% of the population
aren't affected immediately.It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.Virologist from Harvard.The analogy I keep coming back tois Spanish Flu.Spanish Flu?It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,it killed 3% Of the world.He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.You all read the same email I did,and it said "zombies."Are you completely out of your mind?So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.We haven't had contact with them since.But this could lead us to the origin.If we knew where this thing started,then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.So we send in Dr. Fassbach
there to look for the source.He's just a kid.You're right.Attention on deck!At ease!Mr. Under-Secretary.The Under-Secretary
here says you werehis best investigator
when you were at the U.N.I want to send you in. With a team.Help Dr. Fassbach
find whatever it is he needs.You brought...I wanted for the circumstances
to speak for themselves.No.Captain, I'm not your guy.You were on the ground
during the Liberian Civil War.Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.Places you and I both know
Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.Gerry, a handful of SEALs
will go with you as security force.No.My guys will get you in,
you assist the doctor,pursue any leads,
my guys will get you out.We do the heavy lifting.I can't help you. I can't leave my family.Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.Each and every one of these people are
here because they serve a purpose.There's no room here
for non-essential personnel.There's a long line of peoplewaiting for one of those bunks.You want to help your family,let's figure out how we stop this.It's your choice, Mr. Lane.Simple.You don't work for them anymore.- Karin...
- You might not rememberWhat this job did to you, but I do.So do not ask me to say yes to this.I have to go.They're going to kick us off the ship.What?If I go, you, the girls, Tommy,
have a place to stay.If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?Men like Thierry
aren't in charge of anything anymore.You keep this with you.I'll call in once a day.As long as I make that call,
everything's gonna be okay.I'm coming back.Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.As we do.Like we do.Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.I'm not a baby.Okay.Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.I'll be back soon.Yeah?All right, tough guy.....Take care of the ladies for me?Yeah.Deal.You're awesome.Daddy's coming back.This way, sir.<font color="#00ffff">CONTACT

- Skilken.- Hold! Clear.
- Hold.I want an ammo count,
then you reload your mags!Yes, sir!My boy who just died out there was 23.He was 23.You want to tell me why?Because the guy who just shot
himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.What are you talking about?He was supposed to be our best hope.Well, he's not our best hope anymore.Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.He didn't have to, you know.None of them did.We're still trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.Well, shit happens.The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.How do we go about refueling?When I say so. And very carefully.The noise, are they drawn to it?Yeah. Sound draws them.Body shots only seem
to slow them down.Head shots do the trick,
but just to be safewe tend to burn them when we can.- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.- Where?
- Philly. Newark.Bad?- What about Houston?
- St. Louis?- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?Detroit?Guys, I'll be honest with you,I don't know of any place back
home that's doing very well.All right...If the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.It had the word "zombie" in it.Do you know anything about it?Yeah.It was an email, not a memo.Pretty obvious
nobody back home bothered to read it.Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.Most of them guards.
But all of them were bittentrying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.Now, our colonel
said he was the first one.This colonel, is he around?Oh, yeah. He's right here.The guy who's shackled, do you knowwho bit him, what bit him?He was the base doctor.He'd just returned from the field.He'd been sent out
to verify the death of a soldierwho had just gone AWOL
the week before.Some villagers had found this guyfoaming at the mouth,
oozing some kind of black tar.Then he tried to bite one of them.They shot him, tied him up,
threw him in a barn.That's all we know, except the doctorcomes back here
and begins attacking his patients.This soldier,
do you know where he came from?No.Anyone he might
have come in contact with?No.There's got to be records.You are welcome
to take a look if you want.Then the origin could
have come from anywhere.It's a shame you had to flyall the way out here to figure that out.How did you all escape this?The expenditure of ammunition.Is that how you tweaked your leg?No, shit's been bugging me a while.This prick stands right in the mix,while seven or eight of themturn Zeke all at the same time.But they got no time
for OI' Dirty Bastard here.Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.Got no time for his lucky ass.Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?The ones I saw bitten
turned in 12 seconds. Same here?Five or 10 minutes.Yeah, Davidson went
and he turned in 10 minutes."Stevie?""Captain Spekes! Oh, my God!
My God! My God! Are they eating me?"Who's that?Waste no time on that freak.He's C.l.A.Got caught selling guns to North Korea.Davidson,he turned in 10 minutes.That doesn't sound viral
to me at all, sports fans!You're with the C.l.A.?But they're not with me.And who are you?U.N.Oh, my God!Captain, put on the World Music!The dayis saved!Why'd you sell guns to the North?Why not?Are they surviving this?Indeed they are.Using your guns.Guns are half-measures.How then?All right.They took awaythe Zekes' exponential power.They pulled the teeth of all 23 millionin less than 24 hours.The greatest feat
of social engineering in history.It's brilliant.No teeth,no bite.No great spread.Bullshit.More books,
fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.Now, why do you have to burn themto ashes to get them to finally stop?Why do they move like a plague?Why is Israel winning?How is Israel winning?They sealed off their entire countrydays before the undead attacked man.First to know,first to act.People have been
building walls there for two millennia.Right. Yeah, but,finish all thosethousands of years of work a week ago?Impeccable timing is all.You want answers?Jurgen Warmbrunn.That's the man
in Jerusalem you want to see.You ever seen anything like that?Hell, no.We're going to Jerusalem.

Just pedal your ass off.Make sure Maverick here keeps
the nose of that planepointed towards the sun.Just remember, don't lock
the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.Tell me 10 more times.- You good?
- Right here.All right. Don't rush.We've got one chance
to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.If you ain't a crack shot,
don't aim for the head,just get Zeke on the ground.Remember, "Spine's divine,

I'm a God damn Zeke.<i>I got you, Captain. Just say the word.</i><i>It's all right, boys. I got this one.</i><i>- God damn it.
- We got enough!</i>We need to detach the fuel line!Israel better pay off.All right, I have instrument,

I'll be back before dark.The problem with most people is thatthey don't believe
something can happenuntil it already has.It's not stupidity or weakness.It's just human nature.How did you know?Gerald Lane.Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiadabout his employer,
the U.N., back in 2010.Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.Thought you'd have parlayed
those ripples into a self-righteous book.No nose for profit.How did Israel know?We intercepted a communique
from an Indian generalsaying they were
fighting the Rakshasha.Translation, zombies.Technically undead.Jurgen Warmbrunn.High-ranking official in the Mossad.Described as sober, efficient,
not terribly imaginative.And yet you build a wall
because you read a communiquethat mentions the word "zombie"?Well, when put like that,
I'd be skeptical as well.In the '30s, Jews refused to believethey could be sent
to concentration camps.In '72, we refused to fathom
we'd be massacred in the Olympics.In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,and we unanimously agreed
they didn't pose a threat.Well, a month later, the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea.So we decided to make a change.A change?The Tenth Man.If nine of us
look at the same informationand arrive at the exact same conclusion,it's the duty of the tenth man
to disagree.No matter how improbable it may seem,the tenth man has to start diggingon the assumption
that the other nine are wrong.And you were that tenth man.Precisely.Since everyone assumed that this talk of
zombies was cover for something else,I began my investigation
on the assumptionthat when they said "zombies,"
they meant zombies.Was patient zero from India?That's the problem.There's so many
potential sources in playthat no one knows where it began.The organ trade in Germany.Strange examples of violent behavior
across the Asian peninsulas.Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps
spreading, and we do what we can.These are
the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.Two of 10 portalsthrough the security perimeter
into fortified Israel.You're letting people in.Every human being we save
is one less zombie to fight.It's okay.If I could get into India, where
would I start? Who would I speak with?India's a black hole.Forget about patient zero.I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.I'm running out of time. I need specifics.- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.All you can do is find a way to hide.Get troops down there.It's too loud! It's too loud!They're coming over the top!Shit!<i>Command, we have a breach

Requesting immediate departure.<i>Tower to 394. Proceed to runway four.</i><i>Good luck out there.</i>No!There! That one!Stop. Stop.Go! Go!Get them out of here!Stay calm, please. Stay calm.Come on. Go, go, go.What's your destination?I don't know. We were headed here,
but I don't know.I'm Gerry, by the way.Segen.Segen.First or last?Just Segen.So, what we're doing,we've got to change this bandage
and we're gonna clean it.Okay?You okay? Okay?Okay.Come on, gut up. Gut up.Here we go.We're almost there.Okay. Big breaths.Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.Here we go.Come on. Good.Last step. Last step.Big breath.Good job. There it is. Okay.Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.Very good. Okay.You a doctor?No.I've had some training in the field.How did you know?Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?I didn't.Now I'm just a liability.<i>This prick</i><i>stands right in the mix,</i><i>while seven or eight of them</i><i>turn Zeke all at the same time.</i><i>Is that how you tweaked your leg?</i><i>No, shit's been bugging me a while.</i><i>Got no time for his lucky ass.</i><i>Now, the hard part is seeing the crumbs</i><i>for the clues they are.</i><i>And sometimes the thing you thought</i><i>was the most brutal aspect of the virus</i><i>turns out to be the chink in its armor.</i><i>I don't have answers.</i><i>All you can do is find a way to hide.</i>Gerry?<i>Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?</i>I love you. I'm sorry.<i>But you've got to get Thierry now.</i>I'll find him.- Thierry! Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.Gerry needs you. I love you.Gerry? Where are you?On the last flight out.Listen, my phone is dying
and I need some quick intel.You gotta locate the closest
medical research facility.A C.D.C., a W.H.O.,
something that makes vaccines.- <i>And the closest airport to it.</i>
- I don't understand.No time to explain.Just make it happen, man.Okay, Okay...But, Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.Well, go and find out what he needs.You're gonna want to take this.Take it.Your battery is dead.We made contact
with Cardiff Airport, Wales.Your people directed us.There is W.H.O.
research facility nearby,but they are not sure
it's still operational.This is location.Can we make it?<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain.</i><i>I'm glad to report that
we are on our final approach</i><i>to Cardiff Airport in Wales.</i><i>All European airports
are under lock-down.</i>But we have been given
priority status and cleared for landing.<i>We will be allowed to disembark.</i><i>We are very, very lucky.</i>Hey. Who do you belong to?What's there?What is it?You... Bags.We need trolley and bags.Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Bravo 160 heavy.Emergency descent!Prepare for impact.Got to move.Come on, come on.Give me something good.Sir, Cardiff Airport
lost contact with the plane.Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir.<i>Chopper inbound for
immediate relocation.</i><i>I say again.</i><i>All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status</i><i>need to report for immediate relocation.</i>Ma'am?Thierry would like a word with you.Captain, it's only been 48 hours.He's a resourceful man. There's every
chance he could have survived.Sir, I gave him my word
we would look after his family.Yes, sir. I understand.Okay. Let's go. We're good.Daddy!Daddy!Daddy!You're a tough bastard.And a lucky one.Who are you?I came here with a... With a woman.Is she still...Who are you?
Why have you come here?Why do you keep looking at him?'Cause he's the one in charge.You know what this place is?Of course I do. That's why I'm here.Then you understand
how this must look to us.Thisis important to you?- How long have I been out?
- Three days.Give me the phone.Just give me the phone.Give me the God damn phone!
Give me the phone!As soon as you answer my question.Call it.Call the number,
they'll tell you who I am. Call it.<i>Gerry?</i>- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
- <i>My God.</i>We thought you were dead.<i>Gerry, where are you?</i>Thierry, I'm with
a couple of nervous gentlemen.They need some bona fides
before I can speak with you.Of course.<i>This is Thierry Umutoni.</i>Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>Where's Karin?Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?I'm sorry, Gerry.<i>I did what I could.</i>What does that mean?You've got to calm down.
No, stop! Stop.You're going to hurt yourself.You're okay.His family has been sent
to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.I'm sure they'll be safe.Are you? Thierry told you
who I am and what I used to do, right?Yeah.Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.I understand how you feel.- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.Do you have a family?- No.
- No.Then you couldn't possibly understand,
could you?I lost my son and wife in Rome.Rather, I lost my son tosomething that had once been my wife.We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.In your case, there is hope at least.I'm sorry.I'm sorry.Now,why did you come here?What do you need from us?Your worst disease.He wants a what?Deadly pathogen.With a high mortality rate.- But curable.
- Okay, well...You'd want a bacteria
rather than a virus,I would think. Typhus?Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.Rocky Mountain Fever.Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?Mr. Lane believes we can use
such a disease against the undead.I would give you points
for originality, Mr. Lane,if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.One of the many things a virus or
bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.A functioning circulatory system.I'm afraid it boils down
to one simple fact...You can't make a dead person sick.It's not for them.It's for us.I believe these things have a weakness.And that weakness is weakness.Our weakness.I have witnessed them
literally bypass people.Walk right around them like
a river around a rock. Why?I think, because those people were sick.I think they were terminal.And these things could sense it.I think they're spreading a pathogen,and they need a healthy host.But even if you're right, I mean,
infecting the populacewith a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.It's not a cure. It's camouflage.It's camouflage.There's a natural precedent.Hungry predators
will avoid diseased bodies.Equipped with the right pathogen,
our troopswould be essentially
invisible to the enemy.You understand the only way
to prove this theory of yours isfor some idiot to infect themselveswith a lethal pathogen and then...meet with her, face to face.Yes.Do we have what we need to try it?We have all he could want.Typhus, H1N1, SARS.The problem is,they're all stored in B-Wing.What's the matter with B-Wing?Dr. Spellman. Our chief vaccinologist.Within hours of the outbreak,
he'd been sent blood samplesto try and isolate the pathogenic cause.Unfortunately...This is B-Wing now.God damn it.How many?How many are there?There were 80 people working there.I've never seen them move like that.They're dormant.They're awaiting stimulus.NOW, thisis vault 139.That's where your samples would be.This is the sky-bridge.That connects B-Wing
to the main building here.And this, is the only thing
standing between us and the sky-bridge.So,what do you propose, Mr. Lane?You are not serious.B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.We don't even know
if his theory is correct.Well, I know I'm not asking
one of you to take him there.Each has its merits.- Last resort.
- It's too loud.Let's go.Try not to kill one.It only makes
the rest of them more aggressive.Yeah.You sure you want to do this?Of course I'm not. Let's go.Good luck.See you all shortly.Good luck.If anything comes down this hall before
we do, you seal these doors for good.Understood?
- Okay.There they are.Go, go.Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.Come on!They're fine. They're fine.Shit.The vault we need is in 139.Go!Oh, my God.Left, left, left!What are you doing?She'll get you to the vault.That's the vault.- We can make it.
- No, we can't.We can't make it. Let's go!They're not gonna make it.You heard what Javi said,
we cannot open it.They're not alone, we can't open it!They are coming back!We can't leave them there.Come on!Open the door!- Run!
- Run!Run! Faster, come on!Run!In, in, in!Come on!Now where is Gerry?Where is he, where is he, where is he?Come on, come on, where are you?5-6-9-6-4.5-6-9-6-4.What happened to Gerry?Not that one. Not that one.Oh, shit!Shit!Jesus.He's going to inject himself.We have no idea
which one's going to work.We don't know if any of them will work.If he uses anything
he took from that left case,he's dead anyway.What's he doing?<font color="#00ffff">TELL MY FAMILY
I LOVE THEM</font>How long does he have to wait?Before he's infected? Not long, but,that's not the question
we're really asking, is it?Look at them.He just walked right past him!He walked right past him!Like it was nobody!Okay.<font color="#00ffff">FREEPORT SAFE ZONE, NOVA SCOTIA</font><i>This isn't the end.</i><i>Not even close.</i><i>Hi, there.

- Hi, Piggy.I tried to save you a seat,
but somebody took it.<i>Hi, everybody, and welcome to
the first screening of The Muppet Movie.</i>But before we begin, I'd like to thank
everyone who contributed to this film...starting with the little people,
from the hairdressers...to special effects...- That's enough of that, Harry!
- Blow it up! Blow it up!To the costume designers,
to the prop makers...Speeches are not necessary, dear.
Roll the film.But I'd like
to thank everybody...for all of their hard work
and patience...Roll film! Roll film!Roll film!Excuse me.Uncle Kermit, is this about how
the Muppets really got started?Well, it's sort of
approximately how it happened.<i>Why are there so many</i><i>Songs about rainbows</i><i>And what's on the other side</i><i>Rainbows are visions</i><i>But only illusions</i><i>And rainbows have nothing to hide</i><i>So we've been told</i><i>And some choose to believe it</i><i>I know they're wrong

This is a serious call for help.- Yeah?
- Someone help!You with the banjo,
can you help me?I have lost
my sense of direction.Have you tried Hare Krishna?No, I mean, I'm really lost!One second.
Darn, I missed.That's the first thing
to go on a frog, his tongue.The tongue goes and you
can't catch flies.I'm sorry about your tongue,
but I have to get out of this swamp.- I have to catch a plane.
- With that tongue? No way.- There's a boat dock just downstream.
- Thank you.- Just watch out for the alligators.
- I will.- Alligators?
- That's right.- Did you say alligators?
- Read my lips... alligators.I'm not used to alligators

Oh, please!I'm trying so hard.
Please don't get mad.I'm a professional.

they must need bears too.My car's right outside!Gee, a Studebaker.
Where'd you get it?- My uncle left it to me.
- Is he dead?No, he's hibernating.You know, Fozzie, you really
do have a lot of talent.- Thank you.
- How about we put together an act?Nope. Sorry.
I only work as a single.Okay.All right, you talked me into it!
We'll be a team!- Oh, good.
- What's this?- You better pull over here.
- Yes, sir.Hey, what's goin' on?Howdy, Mr. Frog.- I'm a businessman with a proposition.
- What?Let me show you somethin' that
might change your whole life.Hop right over here,
my little green friend.- Listen, mister...
- That's it.This is the kind of chance
you can't afford to pass up.Now, now, don't be afraid.
Watch the window.What's that?<i>Hi, I'm Doc Hopper...</i><i>invitin'you to hop on down and get

revolting thing I've ever seen!I know. I'm a great businessman
and a sweet fella...but I do lack the skills
of a performer.You also make a lousy frog!You, on the other hand,
make a terrific frog!- What?
- He's right. You are very likable.The bear's right.
You, my little likable friend...are gonna do all our
television commercials!- No way!
- Just a minute.There's $500 in it for you,
up front.$500 is just the beginnin'.You could be earnin'
this much every year.- Let's go, Fozzie.
- $500?Would you consider
a bear in a frog suit?- Fozzie!
- I just lost my head.Just a minute, Mr. Frog.
Everything's negotiable.- Okay, here we go. Sorry!
- Hey, that's my Caddy!- Just get it in gear, Fozzie!
- Yes, sir. Here we go!This is money we're talkin' about.
Max!Follow that frog!Max!Follow that frog
with me in the car!I'm sorry, Doc, I just got excited.
Isn't the frog terrific?- Terrific. Now go!
- But you promised me a reward.Later, Max.

You see what I mean?Kermit the Frog, symbol of
Doc Hopper's French-Fried Frog Legs.Isn't that splendid?
Just take a look at it.All I can see are millions
of frogs on tiny crutches.Now listen, boy, don't you
want to be rich and famous?- Not workin' for you, I don't!
- That's right.- Crutches?
- Shut up, Max!We're a small-time operation...but we're expandin',

my best with that frog.Now's the time to do my worst.
Open the door.- No, you open the door!
- What?I'm through, Doc.
The frog is right.You're asking him to do something
terrible. I can't be a part of it.It's a moral decision,
and I'll stand by it!- I'll double your percentage.
- I'll open the door.- Kermit, where are we?
- Well, let's see.We were just travelling down
this little black line here...and we just crossed that
little red line over there.Let's take the blue line, huh?- We can't take that. That's a river.
- I knew that.- Yeah, sure.
- Listen, why don't we just go...- Fozzie?
- Yeah?Who's driving?- Look out! Stop!
- No problem!- Okay, back it up.
- Yes, sir.Fozzie, where did you
learn to drive?I took a correspondence course.- This looks like a nice, quiet spot.
- Uh-huh.It feels like we've been
driving for days.- Funny, I'm still wide awake.
- Me too.Me too.I'm up! I'm up!What's that?They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.Hey, cool it, everybody!Our gentle mornin' melodies have
attracted wanderin' admirers.- Hey, who are you guys?
- We am, is, are and be...they whom as are known as
the Electric Mayhem.For sure!He's Dr. Teeth!Golden teeth and golden tones.
Welcome to my presence.- Thank you.
- Fozzie...I'm Floyd.
I blow bass.And I'm...Zoot.
Sax is your axe.Uh-oh, Zoot skipped a groove again.Wow, like, I'm Janice
on lead guitar, for sure.That's Animal.
Show 'em what you do, Animal!I want to eat drums!No, no, beat drums!
Beat drums!Beat drums! Beat drums!- Down, Animal! Back! Sit!
- Down, back, sit!Hey, don't forget about me.I'm Scooter,
the band's road manager.Yeah, we couldn't go
anywhere without him.- He's the man with the contacts?
- No, he's the man with the van!We're takin' this old church
and turnin' it into a coffee house.Yeah, with real good music
and organic refreshments.Boy, it'll be so fine and laid back
and mellow and profitable.Yeah, but what
brings you dudes here?Listen, see, Kermit here
was living in the swamp.- Fozzie...
- Then a fisherman came along.You can't tell 'em the whole story.
You'll bore the audience.Oh, sorry.
But, Kermit.- The band here wants to know.
- Let 'em read the screenplay.Yes, sir!See, it starts here on page one.<i>The Muppet Movie, huh?</i>Let's see.
"Exterior. Swamp. Day.In a long helicopter shot
we discover Kermit the Frog...playin' his banjo and singin'.A Hollywood agent starts
the frog traveling west.Doc Hopper comes on strong
and they get to this church.Interior. Church. Day. Fozzie.They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.Kermit and Fozzie come walkin'
down the aisle...to the thunderously loud music...of Dr. Teeth
and the Electric Mayhem."Which am us!
Yeah! Yeah!This is a narrative of
very heavy-duty proportions.Cosmic, man. We gotta keep this little
froggy away from this Hopper dude.Too true.
Too true.It is indeed a problem for
us to "probosculate" upon.But it seems the frog and the bear
are temporarily out of service.Wow, like, what
can we do to help them?- Well, if this were the movies...
- Which it is.We'd think of
a clever plot device.Like disguising their car
so they won't be recognized.Right, two, three, four.<i>Oh, yeah</i><i>All right</i><i>Anybody's lover

- Our pleasure, green stuff.Are you sure you won't come
with us to Hollywood?Can't, baby.
But when you get rich and famous...maybe we'll show up
and exploit your wealth.Movin' right along, Fozzie.Bye-bye! Bye-bye!Hollywood! Hollywood!Remember,
this frog does everything.He talks, he sings,
he dances, he tells jokes.He even rides a bicycle.Max, find me a frog and a bear
in a tan Studebaker.Gee, Doc, all I can see is a frog and
a bear in a rainbow-colored Studebaker.- What?
- What?- Fozzie, they're right behind us!
- I know! I know!- How did they recognize us?
- They recognized you.- What do you mean?
- There's a hundred bears around.I'm gaining on 'em, Doc!- Can't you drive any faster?
- No, sir.Pull in front of that sign.- Now duck.
- What?- Get down, Fozzie.

- You're swingin' this turn very wide.Hold it, will ya?
Here we go. Up the bump.Okay, here we go. Hold on.- Pull it up ahead there.
- Look at these cars!- Are you gonna sell my plunger too?
- No, he's not.Look at 'em up there.
Pull it up a little farther.Where shall I stop?
How should I stop?- A little bit farther.

for the bear.- One dragonfly ripple for the frog.
- Yucky.- Don't get 'em mixed up.
- Gotcha.All right, Camilla,
I'll get you a balloon.But you have to pick the color.
Red or green?- Can I give you a word of advice?
- What?Why not take both?What a wild idea!Yeah, a beautiful chicken
like that deserves two balloons.You're right.
I have guys in all the time.Sometimes they get a bunch
of balloons for their girls.- They go gaga for it.
- Gaga? I'll take the whole bunch.I wonder where they went?- Where's your pig friend?
- I'm not really sure.She said she was coming
for ice cream, but...Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Here I am!Here I am! I'm packed!
I'm packed!- Yeah, so I see. What for?
- You said I could come with you.Yeah, but, to buy ice cream,
not to Hollywood.- We're going to Hollywood!
- No! I mean, listen.When I said...
Well, when you heard...Oh, brother.What?- What are you doing?
- About seven knots.- We'll follow you. To the car!
- Yes, sir!Gonzo, we're coming!- Step on it, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.- Kermit, you're a born leader.
- Where is he?Isn't this great?
Here I am, floating in space.This is the place to be.
Whoopee!- Fozzie, bear left.
- What?- Bear left.
- Right, frog.- What? That's cute.
- Never mind.This is...
Look at our little car down there.This is like flying.Maybe this is flying.I'm flying! Whoopee!Doc, isn't that a frog up there?No, that's a frog down here.He's caught in a crosswind, Fozzie.
We're gonna lose him.Oh, no!- What are you doin', Doc?
- I'm goin' after their tires.We're okay now. The wind shifted.
Wait a minute.Stay with him, Fozzie.
He's right above us.- He's okay.
- Yeah. Hi, Gonzo!- Fozzie, come back in here!
- What? Yes, sir.- Watch down the road!
- Kermit!Look out for the billboard!- Take off, Fozzie!
- Yes, sir!Come back, you!No frog's gonna make
a monkey outta me!- I'm back.
- I don't understand any of this.I just gotta
catch up with those guys!Kermit. You were so courageous,
so magnificent.Gee, I don't know what to say.Say the bear was magnificent.
After all, I did the driving.And I took a 100-foot belly flop
onto a moving car.Yes, but, Kermit assumed
the awesome responsibility...of command.- Gee.
- Oh, brother.Why don't we stop
somewhere for the night...and have a quiet,
little dinner for two?Terrific!
I'll eat with you, Miss Piggy.Not you, buzzard beak!<i>Just mon capitaine...</i><i>and moi.</i>Well, that might be nice.Wow.Good evening, Miss Piggy.
You look lovely tonight.Thank you.I'm so sorry
if I kept you waiting.It was won'th it.<i>How charming of vous.</i>I took the liberty
of ordering us some wine.Oh, waiter.Yes?
May I help you?The wine, please.You mad, impetuous fink.
It's champagne.Not exactly.
Sparkling muscatel.One of the finest wines of Idaho.- You may serve us now, please.
- May I?- Look how he does that.
- Yeah. Pretty suave.Don't you want to smell
the bottle cap?- Smells good.
- Yeah.Would you like
to taste it first?Well...- I think he's supposed to.
- Would you taste it for us, please?Excellent choice.Should be for 95 cents.- And may we have straws, please?
- Yes.I expected that.Thank you.
That'll be all for now.Thank you.
Thank you very much.Thank you!Here's to you, Miss Piggy.Drink up.Makes me giggly.The wine?Everything.It's a beautiful evening,
isn't it?Uh-huh.And the moon is just lovely.But you know, Miss Piggy...the moon doesn't look like you.Miss Piggy! Miss Piggy!- Are you Miss Piggy?
- Yes?Telephone.I did place one phone call
to my agent.It'll only be
an eensy-teensy moment.What the hey.Evenin'.
Rowlf. Rowlf the Dog.Sit yourself down.- Kermit. Kermit the Frog.
- Pleased to meet ya.I'm no Heifetz, but I get by.That was...
That was very nice.Whoa, hey, broken heart, right?Does it show?Listen, when you've been ticklin'
the ivories as long as I have...you've seen a broken heart
for every drop of rain.A shattered dream
for every fallen star.Exactly.
She just walked out on me.- Typical. That's why I live alone.
- You do, huh?You bet.I finish work,
I go home, read a book...have a couple of beers,
take myself for a walk and go to bed.Nice and simple.- Stay away from women. That's my motto.
- But I can't.Neither can I.

- Yeah.Phone.It's not that often you see a guy
that green have the blues that bad.Kermie, please!<i>- Piggy, is that you?
- Yes, that's her.</i><i>And this is Doc Hopper.
Now you listen, frog, and listen good.</i>Step outside the motel right now.
My guys'll meet you there.Well, what if I don't?Then your girlfriend
will be ham hocks by breakfast.Kermie, don't, don't!Are you the guys
I'm supposed to meet?Good, Glen. That's good.
Nice and tight.- The professor's here, Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.Kermie, I'm not a bit worried.I know you're planning
something bold and clever.Well, I got us
this far, didn't I?- How are you?
- Professor Krassman.It's good to see you, Doc,
you little rustic devil, you.Where's my victim?
I mean, patient.- Step this way, Professor.
- Of course.Let me introduce you
to your patient.Prof. Krassman is
the world's leading authority...on mind control in frogs.It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic, don't you?Tell us what you're gonna do
to our little Kermit.Well, we're going to perform
an electronic "cerebrectomy."- A what?
- An electronic cerebrectomy!What's that?It's something so sensational
that you'll have to hold on to your hat.- Yes?
- When a German scientist says..."Hold on to your hat,"
it's not casual conversation.Hold on to your hat!
Hat, hold! Good!Now, what we're going to do is bring out
a machine that's going to wow you.Bertram, Bertram,
bring out the machine!Wait till you see this. You think
we're sleeping in Dusseldorf?You think we're taking a nap
in Cologne? No, we're working at night.Each night, a new dial,
a new knob, a diode.- Electronic ce...
- Cerebrectomy.- Electronic cerebrectomy.
- What does it do?What does it do?It turns the brains into guacamole.First of all,
I'll pull out of this, okay?Wonderful.Second?Halt!I detest the surfeit
of provincial laughter.Now, we take your friend,
the little "F-O-R-G"...put him in the chair,
clamp on the terminals...drop the electronic yarmulke...and throw, what we call
in German, the switch.Yes, you little green devil...soon it'll be a hot time
at the old skull tonight.Thank you, Herr Machine.
Now, the frog will do your bidding.He will do your every whim, He will do
your television commercial, yes.He will sell your frogs' legs.- Zaparooni.
- Head full of jelly.- A noggin full of library paste!
- Let's fry them brains!- You've got a fun job.
- I love it, I love it.If I could inflict a little pain during
the afternoon, I sleep good at night.- We'll let you get on with it, then.
- My pleasure.Max.I'll be back later
to pick up what's left of the frog."What's left of the frog." You can have
everything, excuse the brain.All right.
Bring over the frog.Kermie, whatever happens next...I wouldn't give up
this evening together for anything.- Would you?
- Make me an offer.Okay, I got him.
I got him.Good, good.And why don't we take
a little seat, Kermit?Hold his hands down.Get your feeties in place.Will you stop whimpering?Go out like a frog,
not a little toad.Okay, Herr Machine, this is
big time here. Ready to go to work?Hand clamps!Foot clamps!You can struggle
all you want now, frog.It'll do you very little good.All right. And now
it's time to drop...the electronic beanie.Soon there'll be enough voltage coursing
through your little frog brain...to light up Cincinnati.- Here we go.
- Oh, please! Not my frog, please!- Say good-bye to the frog, pig.
- Why should I?Because in ten seconds,
he won't know you from kosher bacon.That does it!What the heck's goin' on here?A pig that goes bananas?
What is this, a luau?Where'd she go?Oh, boys.There she is! Get her!I must reach the switch.
I must!- Switch... I must reach...
- Oh, no.- Now, Kermie.
- Thank you.Well...shall we go now, Kermie?Well...
Just a second.What?
Piggy, it's your agent.Thank you.Yeah, Morty.
What have you got?Commercial?How much? When?Take it.Good-bye!What happened?Flip, flip, flip, flip.Don't worry, Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.Yeah, yeah. Just be cool and
eat another seat cushion.Seat cushion!Well, how do you like the film?I've seen detergents that
leave a better film than this.I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm having a great time.Oh, good.- The "flim" is okey-dokey.
- Good. Roll film."Flim" is "rooling."Quiet, quiet.This is the patriotic part.- Should we stand up?
- No.<i>Oh, beautiful for spacious skies</i><i>For amber waves of grain</i><i>For purple mountains'majesties</i><i>Above the fruited plain</i><i>America, America</i><i>God shed His grace on thee</i><i>And crown thy good
with brotherhood</i><i>From sea to</i><i>Shining sea</i>Patriotism swells in the heart
of the American bear.Hold it, boys. Hold it!Hold your fire!Now, boys, no reflection
on the job you been doin'...but I decided
to bring in a specialist.Now, boys, this is Snake Walker.Tell 'em what you do, Snake.Kill frogs.- How long is it to Hollywood?
- We gotta be there by tomorrow.Hey, Kermit! Are you going to
get an agent like that pig had?Gonzo, you know
he's touchy about that.- Hey, who's that? I don't believe that.
- Oh, no.- That's Piggy.
- Yeah, I know.Do you think we should
help her with her bag?Oh, Kermie!
What an unbelievable coincidence!Hello again.
It's me!Would you hold my laundry case?- Well.
- Well what?So much has happened to me
since I saw you last.Frankly, Miss Piggy,
I don't give a hoot.My name is Rowlf the Dog, and I was
playin' the piano in a... Oh, never mind.I missed you.Don't I get
one kissy-kissy?I don't think so, Miss Piggy.Just one little hug?<i>You've been listening
to music to hug frogs by...</i><i>and this is Doc Hopper sayin'
that if Kermit the Frog...</i>don't stop right now and call me...and agree to be my national spokesman,
he will soon be a frogburger.<i>- We'll be okay.
- Oh, mon capitaine.</i>Oh, boy. Yeah.
What? No problem!It's okay, it's okay.
No problem. Hey, all right!We're in trouble.I wish I still had
my Studebaker.There's probably somethin'
broken about the engine.Hey, don't worry.
Someone's bound to come along.Yeah?Well, I guess we blew it,
huh, Gonzo?Yeah.But the sky sure is
beautiful out here.Look at that.We're gonna miss
the auditions tomorrow, right?Boy, you could get lost
in a sky like that.I wish I had
those balloons again.So much for Hollywood.Listen, gang.
I never promised we'd make it.I never promised anything.<i>This looks familiar</i><i>Vaguely familiar</i><i>Almost unreal, yet</i><i>It's too soon to feel yet</i><i>Close to my soul</i><i>And yet so far away</i><i>I'm going to go
back there someday</i><i>Sun rises, night falls</i><i>Sometimes the sky calls</i><i>Is that a song there</i><i>And do I belong there</i><i>I've never been there</i><i>But I know the way</i><i>I'm going to go back there</i><i>Someday</i><i>Come and go with me</i><i>It's more fun to share</i><i>We'll both be completely</i><i>At home in midair</i><i>We're flyin', not walking</i><i>On featherless wings</i><i>We can hold on to young</i><i>Like invisible string</i><i>There's not a word yet</i><i>For old friends who've just met</i><i>Part heaven, part space</i><i>Or have I found my place</i><i>You can just visit</i><i>But I plan to stay</i><i>I'm going to go back there</i><i>Someday</i><i>I'm going to go back there</i><i>Someday</i>I didn't promise anybody anything.What do I know
about Hollywood anyway?Just the dreams I got from sitting
through too many double features.<i>So why did you leave the swamp
in the first place?</i>'Cause some agent fella
said I had talent.He probably says that
to everybody.<i>On the other hand,
if you hadn't left the swamp...</i><i>you'd be feeling
pretty miserable anyhow.</i>Yeah, but then it would
just be me feelin' miserable.Now I got a lady pig
and a bear and a chicken...a dog, a thing...
whatever Gonzo is.- He's a little like a turkey.
- Yeah, A little like a turkey.- But not much.
- No, I guess not.Anyhow, I brought 'em all out here
into the middle of nowhere.It's all my fault.Still...whether you promised them
something or not...you gotta remember
they wanted to come.But that's because
they believed in me.No, they believed in the dream.- Well, so do I, but...
- You do?- Yeah. Of course I do.
- Well, then?Well, then...I guess I was wrong
when I said I never promised anyone.I promised me.Hey, now, wait a minute.Hey, what's happening?At the moment,
we're what's happening.Oh, great!
Wonderful! Yeah!Zoot! Hey, Zoot!Hold it, hold it.
Animal, cool it back there.Yeah.All right, yeah.Hey, it's wonderful to see you,
but how did you ever find us?Oh, easy. We just read
the screenplay you left us."Exterior desert, night."
We knew right where you were.Like, can you get behind it?Hey, when you dudes
have to be at that audition?- 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
- Well, climb aboard the bus.We'll have breakfast
at Hollywood and Vine.<i>Movin'right along</i><i>Oh, yeah</i>Here we go.<i>Movin'right along</i>Kermie, whisper sweet nothings
into my ear.Motorcycle cop."Motorcycle cop"
is a sweet nothing?A motorcycle cop is chasing us.Hey, Dr. Teeth,
you better pull over.Hey, easier done than said.- Drag city.
- What do we do now?Oh, dear.Hey, hey. The man with the badge.
The police.The cops, the fuzz, the P-l...- Don't you dare.
- I wouldn't think of it.Did we do something
wrong, Officer?- Kermie, it's him!
- Okay, gang. Let him explain.This whole disguise is
only so I could warn you.Yeah. Sure, sure.I never thought Doc would hurt Kermit.
I thought he was gonna lean on him.But now he's got this
frog killer in from the coast...and the man is deadly!Oh, no. Kermit,
what are we gonna do?It's time to beat feet,
green stuff.I love it. Chase music is
one of our best riffs.Hold it, Dr. Teeth.
What's up ahead?- Only an old ghost town.
- Fine.Listen, you go tell Doc Hopper
I'll be waiting for him there.- What?
- Kermit, you'll get killed!Listen, guys. Listen.I can't spend my whole life
running away from a bully.It's time for a showdown.Chugga, chugga.Hey, listen.
I'm gonna check things out.Everybody stay on the bus, okay?- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?Can I take Animal for a walk?
He needs some exercise.Yeah, sure.What is that?That's one of my latest inventions...
a musical rotating rain barrel.- Oh, yeah.
- You see...I'm Dr. Bunsen Honeydew,
and this is my assistant, Beaker.We live here,
perfecting useful inventions.Come in, come in.Welcome to our laboratory.Please don't touch anything.Is this the only street into town?Yes, yes.Hey, what are you dudes
doin' in here?I'm so glad you asked!We're perfecting
our latest invention...insta-grow pills.Well, what in the name
of Fats Waller is that?A four-foot prune!A four-foot prune.Yeah, man. Well, what else
do these pills make big?They work on anything.But the effect is,
sadly, temporary.Sadly temporary.Hey, Kermit!
Here comes Doc Hopper!I know.
I'll be ready for him.Okay, frog. Where are ya?I'm here. I'll meet you
in the middle of the street.- Oh, yeah?
- Man to frog.- All right, Hopper.
- All right, frog.One last chance.You can do my TV commercials
live or stuffed.What's the matter with you?You gotta be crazy chasin' me
halfway across the country.Why are you doin' this to me?'Cause all my life I wanted to own
a thousand frog-leg restaurants...and you're the key, greenie.Yeah, well,
I've got a dream too.But it's about singing and
dancing and making people happy.The kind of dream that gets better
the more people you share it with.And, well, I've found a whole bunch
of friends who have the same dream.And it kind of
makes us like a family.You have anybody
like that, Hopper?Once you get all those restaurants,
who're you gonna share it with?Who are your friends, Doc?
Those guys?I got lots of friends.Max, for instance.- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man, Doc.I think if you look
in your heart...you'll find you really want
to let me and my friends go...to follow our dream.But if that's not
the kind of man you are...and if what I'm saying
doesn't make any sense to you...well, then,
go ahead and kill me.All right, boys.Kill him.No, wait, please!- Everybody goin' to Hollywood?
- Yeah!Next stop is Hollywood and Vine.Look at the ocean!
The ocean!Yes, Mr. Lord. I'll have those
deal memos for you in a jiffy.I'm sorry.Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.
He's packaging a blockbuster.Look! It's wonderful!
Like a dream come true.Don't count your tadpoles until they're
hatched. I still have to audition.Hey, ain't nothin' to it
but to do it.And where do you think
you're going?Hi, there!
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.You can't just walk in here
off the street, you know.Especially not with
all these animals.Animals?
What's wrong with animals?This is a movie studio,
not a zoo!Besides...I'm allergic to animal hair.
Now, get along, all of you.Now, wait a second.
See here, miss.I may not be one of your fancy
Hollywood frogs, but I deserve a chance.We're going to stay here until you let
us in to see Lew Lord, aren't we, gang?Yes! Yes!- Yeah, come on!
- We're gonna sit right down and wait.Yes, Security? Miss Tracy.I want to report a...Shake! Shake, everyone!- That's it!
- Look what it's doing!- Go get 'em, man!
- Way to go!Allergies are nothing
to sneeze at.I'm allergic to cats, myself.Okay, way to go, guys!Thanks, miss.Well, friends...this is it.Mr. Lord? Forgive the interruption,
but I'm here to audition.Yes, yes.We've come over 2,000 miles just...Oh, boy.We're all with you.Please, sir, my name is Kermit the Frog,

Secretary of the Treasury Rittenhouseis resigning because his wife is sick.MAN: Sick, my ass.So, who passed Rittenhouse
the hemlock?AFL-CIO wanted him off
the Council of Economic Advisersfor not supporting the pension bill,and the President's
going to need Labor next fall.And State's still fuming about
the Trade Office screw-up at the G8.Pentagon is unhappy
with his readiness reduction proposals.BETH: Greenspan dislikes him.STUART: Christ!
Who didn't this guy piss off?No wonder the wife's sick.(ALL LAUGHING)JENNY: She's not sick. She's a drunk.How do you know that?Mike Woodward over at Treasury.Mrs. Rittenhouse started drinking
a couple of years agowhen her husband
had a series of affairs.Stepped it up last summer
after their son died of leukemia.You wanna do something
on "the price that wives pay"?- STUART: What else?
- Mike Woodward?- Wife, three kids?
- He's been after me for months,so I threw him a breakfast
and hit him up about Rittenhouse.Bob Campbell's leaving.So at midnight Saturday,
anchor shift's opening up.Why would I wanna give up the White

who is two years older than you.(SOFTLY) Check.Well, anyway, as much as I would like
to stay here and get silly with you, Mom,- I can't. I gotta go.
- I know, I know, I know.I'm sorry about this.We'll get over it. I love you.I love you, too.Be good.I was with the secretary since
he's been governor of Connecticut.Came to Washington with him.I moved here because
I was dedicated to his career.I trusted the man.And then he fucked me.- He what?
- No, I didn't have sex with him.I should say, I didn't have sex with him,
but somebody sure did.It was about to come out,
so he resigned.But because I was hired
from outside the government pool,I don't get conveyed to the next
secretary, so now I'm out a job.Because he couldn't keep his hands
off women.- Do you have proof?
- He thinks he was being so clever.He had a private phone line
installed in his office.Nobody else could answer it.I picked it up once, said hello,
and it's nobody home.It rings, he shuts the door.
Why not hang a sign?Do you have a name?(SCOFFS) This is what I get
for talking to the press.I'm selling my soul right now.
I can feel it. I can feel it.I name a name
and get someone into trouble.So you do have a name.Just a first name.
Oh, my God, I'm going to say it.Ellie.Ellie? Nothing else?I think the President knows about it, too.Overheard the secretary
talking to him about her.(SCOFFS) Isn't Washington sick?Hi.How you doing?Can I help you?Well, actually, we're looking
for your mom. Is she around?My mom's sick. She's not here.Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?Yeah.That's exciting. Looks like a...Like a long trip, huh?So listen,
do you know where you're going?RITTENHOUSE: She's going back
to the house.Hey. You wanna stop that?Lily, please?Lily, that's a pretty name.Lily, do as I say.Go on. I'll be right there.If we could just get a minute
of your time.What do you want from me?Well, we'd like to talk
about your resignation.My wife is sick. She's in the hospital.That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.We could talk about your wife,
or we could just talk about Ellie.Turn the camera off.If you wanna talk to me, turn it off.Cut it.- We know everything.
- Nobody knows everything.Well, we know about
the secret phone linesand the whispered calls
to the President.And about a secretary of the Treasury
who's kept his entire departmentin the dark about what he's really doing,
about a cover storyabout his resignation
that just fell through.I mean, sir, you want me to go on?And you're just gonna break it?Well, that's what we do for a living.Well, congratulations.You now have the biggest story
in history.Good luck to you.Personally, I think it's a mistake
to run the story,but, hey, what the hell?Why not?What difference
does anything make anymore?Look.I know you're just a reporter,but you used to be a person, right?I wanted to be with my family.Can you understand that?Okay, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse resignsbecause of a mistress named Ellie.Biggest story in history?(SCOFFS)What an ego.Now, if it was the President...Whoa, whoa, whoa!Okay, the President
has a mistress named Ellie,and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affairand takes the fall and resigns,
and the President buys him a yacht?(EXCLAIMS)Son of a bitch!Shit. Shit.What? Okay, okay!God. No, God.FBl. If you would please, ma'am?- What do I do with the car?

- Got it.FBl AGENT: Let's go.Would you come this way, please?Morton Entrekin, Ms. Lerner.I'm expected back at MSNBC at 6:00,and I think I should be there.People knew about
the Manhattan Project, you know,and they kept it a secret.That was just the creation
of the atom bomb.(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)Hmm.(DOOR OPENING)Ms. Lerner? Tom Beck.I understand
you've come into some information.Ms. Lerner was just expressing
her lack of enthusiasmfor matters of national security where
journalistic competitiveness is at stake.Mr. President, I'm not interested
in using Ellie to further my career.What do you know about E.L.E.?I know you should have picked
a better cover story than a sick wife.See? What'd I tell you?We'd always thought the deadline
for going publicwas the publication of the budget,since we've spent more money
than we can hide.But the budget comes out in two weeks.I don't suppose I could convince you
to sit on this for two weeks.No such thing as two weeks
in the news business.And I can't appeal to your sense
of what's in the nation's best interest.Well, I always thought the truth
was in the nation's best interest.ENTREKIN: You wanna hold her?BECK: What if we go public in 48 hours?
Now, that's doable, isn't it?ENTREKIN: That would be very difficult,
Mr. President.Morton,if she knows, how long can it be before
CNN or The Post breaks the story?Now, this was never gonna be a secret
as long as you wanted it to be.Give us two days, Ms. Lerner.You'll get second-row center
at the White House press conference.Now, from what I know of your career,
that's a promotion.- I want exclusivity.
- Now, listen, young lady,this is a presidential favor.I'm letting you go because
I don't want another headache,and I'm trusting you because I know
what this can do for your career.It might seem that we have each other
over the same barrel, Ms. Lerner,but it just seems that way.- I want the...

they were running around like madand throwing flowers and...
It was wonderful.Especially Emma.

an evening or not?Jenny, I know that you hate me.I know that you have terrible things
that you wanna say to me.You have to get over it. Life goes on.(SNICKERING) Life goes on, okay.What's so funny?Life...We'll see.What's so funny about "life goes on"?What? Life going on?I don't think it's so funny
that life goes on.Dad, you need
to get back together with Mom,because she's all alone in the world
and she needs you right now, okay?Jenny,- I just got married.
- I know, I know, and I'm sorry.Chloe, this has nothing to do with you.JASON: Well, it has to do something
for me, for Christ's sake.This is insane.I have to apologize for my daughter.Listen, it's not your fault.All right, I have to go.I know you think I'm a bad person.

- Mr. President.MAN: Ten seconds, Mr. President.Five, four...Good evening.A few minutes ago, the United States'
ambassadors to every countryin the world
told the leaders of those nationswhat I am about to tell you.It's a bit complicated,
so it will take some time.So I hope you will bear with me,
hear what I have to say.A little over a year ago,two American astronomers,
Marcus Wolf and Leo Biederman,working on a mountaintop in Arizona...(SHUSHING) Nobody say anything.ON TV:... saw something in the night sky
that caused them great concern.A comet.But the comet was... Well,there was a remote possibility
that the comet was on a paththat could bring it into direct contact
with the Earth.(REPORTERS MURMURING)Now, we get hit all the time
by rocks and meteors.Some of them the size of cars,
some no bigger than your hand.But the comet we discovered
is the size of New York City,from the north side of Central Park
to the Battery.About 7 miles long.Put another way,this comet is larger than Mount Everest.It weighs 500 billion tons.Now, chances are that this thing
will miss us...Astrophysicists, geologists
and climatologists.Where the hell is Science?Paris, London, Tokyo, Tel Aviv.
I want it everywhere.That guy at Berkeley,
did Hale-Bopp stand-ups?And graphics? I need graphics!BECK ON SCREEN:
Comets begin far out in space.They're what's left over
from the creation of the solar systemafter the planets were formed
billions of years ago.Now, these chunks of space debrisare in an elongated orbit
around our sun.But every now and then,
one of them gets bumped,sort of like a billiard ball on a pool table,
and is knocked into a different orbit.Now, if this comet
continues on its path around the sunand keeps its present course,sometime on August 16,
roughly a year from now,there's a chance
that we might have impact.So for the past eight months,
the United States and Russiahave been building
the largest spaceship ever constructed.It's being built in orbit around the Earth,and we call it the Messiah.And right now, a team ofAmerican
astronauts and one Russianare at Cape Canaveral in Florida.In two months,they will leave on the shuttle Atlantis
to board the Messiah.This is the crew that will stop the comet.I'd like the world to meet
some extraordinary people.First is Mission Commander
Oren Monash.Commander, would you introduce us
to your team?I would be honored, sir.Pilot, Andrea Baker.Medical Officer Gus Partenza.From Russia, Nuclear Specialist
Colonel Mikhail Tulchinsky.Navigator Mark Simon,and Rendezvous Pilot Spurgeon Tanner.- Hello, Mr. President.
- Hello, Mr. President.Captain Tanner,
you flew six shuttle missions.You were the last man to walk
on the moon, weren't you, sir?Yes, sir,but Oren here will be doing
most of the flying on this one.I'll just be taking us down
to the comet surface.Well, it's good to know we're going
to have your kind of experience- up there, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.Godspeed to you all.
We're counting on you.Thank you, sir.Got Beijing, Rome, SÃ£o Paulo,
Cairo, Berlin.Does anyone know how big the one was
that killed all the dinosaurs?Something majestic, mysterious,
with a fanfare for the introand a theme to the longer promos.- It's hitting the goddamn Earth?
- MAN: That's what he's saying.- Bring that up again.
- He'll scare the shit out of everybody.Our society will continue as normal.Work will go on.You will pay your bills.(REPORTERS CHUCKLING)There will be no hoarding.There will be no sudden profiteering.
I'm freezing all wages, all prices.What a bottle of water
cost you yesterday,it will cost you tomorrow.Now I'll take a few questions.(REPORTERS CLAMORING)Ms. Lerner?(JENNY CLEARS THROAT)Jenny Lerner, MSNBC.- Jenny Lerner?
- Son of a bitch.Mr. President,why wasn't this announcement
made sooner?Well, until we knew
we could build the rocketand the comet could be intercepted,we saw no reason to alarm the planet.(REPORTERS CLAMORING)Do you have another question,
Ms. Lerner?Yeah.Is there a connection
between the cometand the recall
of American troops from abroad?BECK: Our fighting men and women
are coming homebecause we felt it prudent,
in light of domestic security concerns,to have them available.Although I certainly hope
we don't need to use them.Next question.(REPORTERS CLAMORING)Actually, Mr. President, if...
Just one final question, sir.MSNBC has learned
that Secretary Rittenhousedid not leave for the reasons
announced by your administration.In fact, isn't it true, sir,that not everyone in your administration
is convincedthat the Messiah will save us?Secretary Rittenhouse
served his country with full devotion.He resigned for personal reasons.Now, I can promise you this,
Ms. Lerner, all of you,everyone in this room
and everyone listening to my voice,that at some point
over the next 10 months,all of us will entertain our worst fears
and concerns.But I can also promise you this.Life will go on.We will prevail.Mr. President! Please!BECK: Sally.
SALLY: Sir! Sir.What is the comet's name?The two scientists who found the comet
were killed in a car crashwhile racing from their observatory
to alert the world.So we named it for them,
Wolf-Biederman.(CHUCKLES) Leo Biederman.
They said it again.(SHUSHING)Leo, is he talking about you?- He is, isn't he?
- I'm trying to listen.(PHONE RINGING)Why were the Russians
brought into the construction phase...(DOORBELL RINGS)- Honey, can you get that, please?
- Janie, get the door.BECK: Well, we have the technology
to build the ship.They have the technology to make it go.There's someone at the door for you,
Leo.(REPORTERS CLAMORING)MAN: You've been watching
live coverage of President Tom Beck.- I can't believe this. This is so weird.
- Dr. Wolf from Astronomy Club?- Yeah, I guess so.
- I think it's really neat.Nobody on our block discovered
the world was gonna end before.DON: He's still very much alive.
He's still alive, everyone!(CHUCKLES) He's right here,
and he's still alive. Okay?(NEIGHBORS CLAMORING)BOY: Hey, Leo, cool.As far as we know, what happened
was that Dr. Wolf saw the cometin my photograph,
so he shared the discovery with me.And then he was killed in that crashand everything got mixed up
in Washington,so the President thought
I was dead, too.- STUDENTS: Leo!
- Jasmine.How does it feel having your name on it?I don't want anyone to think
that I'm trying to take something awayfrom Dr. Wolf, because I'm not.But it's kind of cool.Jason.You know,you're gonna have sex a lot more now
than anyone else in our class.(STUDENTS WHOOPING)Don't listen. Don't.Really?Thank you for your sexual insight,
Mr. Thurman. You can sit down now.Famous people always get sex,
Mr. Perry.That's the main reason
it's good to be famous.(WHISPERING)Fruit, reactor. Bottle, rocket. Okay?- A nuclear reactor in space?

- Chernobyl almost worked.(WOMEN GIGGLING)So what happens
after you plant the bomb?Well, we have seven hours.We're gonna put bombs inside
the comet. Let me follow these two.- I don't trust that combination.
- Okay. Right, after seven hours,the 14-hour rotational cycle
of the comet, right, spins.We're gonna get married.
God knows I want to marry you.But the day I get back, the last thing
I'm gonna do is step inside of a church.I don't do churches well.'Cause there's only
seven hours of darkness.Then the sun starts hitting the surface

I might not be coming back,she wouldn't say it and I wouldn't say it.Okay?- Yes, sir.

I ever had the privilege of working with.Yeah, yeah. Off the record?Well, they've been trained in ways
I'll never understand.They're smarter and in better shape
than we ever were in the old days.Sober, serious. I guess I'd be
a little happier about this whole thingif I thought that any of them
were as scared as I am.Well, they're not scared of dying.They're just scared
of looking bad on TV.GUS: Now, look,
I wish I'd been to the moon.I got respect for everybody
who's gone to the moon,but this mission ain't going to the moon.That's right. Frank Gifford, he was
a great football player in his time,but if he played now,
he'd get his ass busted.MARK: That's right.(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)(PEOPLE CHATTERING)All I'm saying is, the moon did not have
a rotational cycle of 14 hours.I mean, this is... We only have seven
hours of dark when the sun's not upto land on this thing. It was light
when he landed. This is gonna be dark.- We're not gonna be able to see.
- (CHUCKLING) You can't see now, Gus.MIKHAIL: Don't worry, don't worry.(MIKHAIL SPEAKING RUSSIAN)- We what?
- We can do it.No, no, stay down.I woke up this morning
and I realized none of you want me here.You don't even really know who I am,
which is okay.I walked on the moon,
but I didn't belong to you.I belonged to your daddies.
Now, if I ask you to ask your daddieswhat I meant to them,
to explain to you what I'm doing here,that's only gonna
make things worse. So...What do we do?You haven't trained for this mission.We respect you.- I appreciate that.
- But you're here...You're here because the powers that bethink we need a familiar face
on this trip.- You're here for public relations.
- No, no. I'm herebecause the powers that be know
that I'm the only person on this missionwho's ever landed on the moon.And I have 500 landings
on aircraft carriers.- We've trained on...

500,000 pounds of liquid fuel,the shuttle crew heads toward
their initial destination.When the crew enters the Messiah,they will find a payload
of eight nuclear devicesthat will eventually be used
to blow up the comet.The Messiah itself will be poweredby an experimental
nuclear propulsion systemthat was originally created
for a very different purpose.That program was called Orion.Now, with the help
of Russian engineers,a technology designed to propel

TANNER: Opening payload doors.Don't let that little bit of gravity
down there go to your heads.(TANNER CHUCKLES)Okay.Start the clock.JENNY ON TV: If all is going
according to schedule,the astronauts should now be placingthe MOLEs on the comet surface.The MOLEs are...
Well, they're what they sound like.They are drilling machines
that burrow to a depth of 100 meters,where they wait to be detonated.Each one carries
a 5,000 kiloton warhead.- How's our time?
- It's getting tight. 1:36:30.It's taking too long.Yep.What happens if they do not
get off the comet's surface in time?The sun striking the comet
will cause the temperatureto rise 350 degrees
in just a few minutes,and activate the high-speed gas jets.Well, if that happens, it will be
like trying to work in a minefield.TANNER ON RADIO: Mark,
what's your MOLE 4 readout?MARK: MOLE 4 running true at 75 feet.(BEEPING)- Son of a bitch.
- MARK: What?- It's stuck.
- Try backing it up.- ANDREA: What's your depth?
- Seventy-five feet.- Is that enough?
- No, that'll just break pieces- off the surface.
- That's not deep enough.Yeah, Fish,
I know that's not deep enough.- I'm going in.
- MARK: Oren, no.MONASH: No, I'm gonna see
if I can free it up.- Standby tether attached.
- All right, I got you.ANDREA: Oren, suit pressure, 3.5.Come on, come on.- How's my time?
- TANNER: 23:57.Another six minutes,
they won't have time to get back to us.Blow the tethers. Let's go get them.If we go after them, we may not have
enough fuel to get off the surface.Go on, blow the goddamn tethers!MOLE 3 at depth.
We're heading your way, Oren.TANNER: Calculate exactly how much
prop we need to get off this rock.- We'll shut it down when we hit it.
- Will do.MONASH: It opens up
into a cave down here.MOLE gotjammed against the side.GUS: Okay, Fish, team two
at location four. Give me your hand.- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.Everything was going great.
We gotjammed up at 75 feet.(GRUNTING) Okay, hold up.- All right, try backing it up.
- Roger that.- That's it.
- TANNER: No, a little more, a little more.- Shut it down.
- No, look, they always put extra- in these tanks.
- Fish, shut it down.Okay.Come on, you bastard! Come on! Time.TANNER: 1:02.Figured we'd better pick you kids up
after school.Check your six, 100 yards.I think we'd better hurry, boys.All right, it's going! It's going.(BEEPING)MONASH: MOLE's at 125 feet.The sun's rising behind you.

- Payload doors still open.Close them as we go.TANNER ON TV: Houston, all MOLEs
are at depth. Nukes hot and ready.We lost Partenza
to explosive out-gassing,and Monash is injured.- We have to go get Gus.
- TANNER: There's no time for that.- Re-pressurize the cargo bay.
- He's going to die out there.We can still find him. He has a beacon.I don't have time to argue with you.
Just sit down, be quiet.- Turn on the fucking locator!
- We used most of our propellant- to get us out of the coma.
- MIKHAIL: We can't just leave him.- We have to go back!
- If we go back for Gus, we all die.We can't just leave him in space!(WHISPERING) Sit down, Mick.
Sit down. It's okay.JENNY ON TV: The Messiah has
safely lifted off the comet,but, sadly, Gus Partenza has been lost.Gus Partenza,
a native of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,and graduate
of Carnegie Mellon University,joined the NASA space programshortly after completing
his medical training at Duke University.Dr. Partenza was selected
specifically for this missionnot only for his medical expertise,
but also for his dedicationto the advancement
of space technology.Yeah.With the loss of Dr. Gus Partenza
and with Oren Monash injured,Captain Spurgeon Tanner
is now in charge of the mission.The Messiah has successfully docked
with the Orion-powered boostersand is now prepared to detonate
the bombs planted on Wolf-Biederman.The Messiah's exterior-mounted camera
will show us the detonationbut not before being temporarily
blocked out by the nuclear blast.Once again, let me remind you,
there is a 20-second delay,so when the picture comes back to us,the comet should already have been
knocked off its present course.TANNER: Prepare to remove safeties
and fire.MIKHAIL: Safeties removed.Weapons armed.(BEEPING)Three, two, one.Now.JENNY: So now we're just waiting
for the picture to come back.(ALARM BEEPING)Decompression in area six.MARK: Mick, I'll get the halon.(SCREAMING IN AGONY)(PEOPLE CHATTERING ON RADIO)(ALARM STOPS)MAN: Yes. I'm still here.(SIGHS)(SOFTLY)... even larger.
We've lost contact with the Messiah.MAN: We're live in 10 seconds.Cue the President.Mr. President, five, four, three...Hello, America.It is my unhappy duty to report to you
that the Messiah has failed.This computer-enhanced radar image
from Houstonshows how the detonation succeeded,
however, did not destroy the comet.There are now two pieces,
one 6 miles wide,the other a mile and a half.Both are still on a path towards Earth.We've lost communication
with the Messiah spacecraft,although we continue to track it visually.(CAITLIN HUMMING)We don't know how many are alive.
We don't know their condition.Now we have to make
some decisions together.What do we do? You have a choice.
We have a choice right now.Ever since the comet was discovered,we've been hoping
and working for the best,but we've also been planning
for the worst.Our strategy has been twofold.First, our Strategic Missile Commandis preparing to coordinate
with the Russiansa massive strike of Titan missiles
to intercept the comets.If we can deflect these comets enough,they will bounce harmlessly
off our atmosphereand head on out into space.Unfortunately, the Titans
cannot be launcheduntil the comets
are only a few hours away.And while we are confident
the missile attack will succeed,it is only prudent
that we now take cautionary stepsto ensure the continuation
of our way of life,to guarantee
that there will be enough of us leftto rebuild a new worldin the unlikely event
that the comets do strike the Earth.So in the soft limestone of Missouri,we've been preparing a network
of immense caves.And they're almost finished.And we can put
a million people in them.And that million people can survive
there, underground, for two years,until the air clears and the dust settles.Now, the cave is more than a dormitory.
It is our new Noah's Ark.We're storing seeds and seedlings,
plants, animals. Enough to start over.On August 10th, a computer
will randomly select 800,000 Americansto join the 200,000 scientists, doctors,engineers, teachers, soldiers and artists
who have already been chosen.Other countries are preparing similar
caves along whatever lines they feelare best to preserve their way of life.This is ours.Beginning tonight
and continuing until the crisis passes,I am declaring a state of martial law.The armed forces
and the National Guardare working with local law enforcement.A national curfew begins
at midnight tonight.Now, wherever you are, go home.Stay off the roads after sunset.Crimes against persons or property
will be dealt with swiftlyand harshly.News stations around the nation
are being faxed copiesof the lottery procedure as we speak,and they'll be broadcasting the details
to you in a few moments.(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)(SIGHS)I wish...No.Wishing is wrong.It's the wrong word right now.
That's not what I mean.What I mean is...I believe in God.Relax.BECK: I know a lot of you don't,
but I still want to offer a prayerfor our survival,mine included.Because I believe that God,whomever you hold that to be,hears all prayers,even if sometimes the answer is no.So may the Lord bless you.May the Lord keep you.May the Lord lift up
his divine countenance upon youand give you peace.WOMAN: And in five, four, three, two...We now have the details
for the national lottery.Those of you
who have been preselectedwill be notified
within the next few minutes.For the rest, on the night of August 10th,
those whose Social Security numbershave been randomly selected
by computer will be notified.While some Americansover 50 years of age
have been preselected for the Arkdue to their expertise
in a necessary field of study,no men and women over 50
in the general populationwill be included in the lottery.The...The... The evacuation of those
who have been selected for the Arkwill take no longer than two days,
beginning on August 12th.During this two-day period,
no unofficial travel will be permitted.Those selected will be taken
by bus and trainto the underground Ark site
by military personnel.Civil defense teams have been formedin every town with a population
over 5,000.They will distribute supplies
and organize group sheltersin underground parking facilities
and other appropriate sites.Construction plans,(PHONE RINGING)equipment lists and locations- for securing the necessary provisions...

camera circuitry is shot.So, Andy,
can we get back into the cargo bayto reroute the video functions?Starboard cargo porthole's blown.
We could go in with the EVAs,but there's not much left
in the life-support packs.We should be able to raise Houston
on the low band once we get closer.And the Orion is still functioning?System check was okay, but I don't
know about the radiation shielding.So if we fire it up,
we beat the comet back to Earth,(CHUCKLING) but we may end up
glowing in the dark.Okay. So...Anybody?Let's go home.Okay.ROBIN: I have to say,
it's liberating knowingthat I'm not going to be called.I don't think I've ever been happier.
I've even stopped smoking.What are you gonna do
with all that extra money you save?Do you know the National Gallery
is saving all of the art?They're shipping it to the caves.I've given them my beautiful
18th-century desk from New Englandand all the Sheraton silver.I really feel like I'd protected somethingwhen I gave them.(CHUCKLES) You should see

she would have been in the picture,but there was no one else

confirmed the launchof all the Titan missilesfrom their positions in North Dakota
and Wyoming.The comets are now
approximately 14 hoursoutside of Earth's atmosphere,and we are told
it should take these missilesless than 20 minutes
to reach their target.Okay, here's what we're looking at.All of the Titans have been launched.We still won't know
if they've made a difference.The comets have to travel for a whilebefore the radar tracking stations
can see if they've been pushedto a safe course that'll bypass the Earth.So one more time, we have to wait.- Are we on?
- MAN: We're on, Mr. President.Our missiles have failed.The comets are still headed for Earth,and there's nothing we can do
to stop them.So this is it.If the world does go on,it will not go on for everyone.ON TV: We have now been able to calculate
the comets' final trajectories,and we have determined
where they're going to strike.The smaller of the two comets,
Biederman, will hit firstsomewhere along the Atlantic seaboard,probably in the waters
off the coast of Cape Hatteras,in just under 12 hours,
at 4:35 p. m. Eastern Daylight Time.The impact of the comet is going to be,well, disastrous.There will be a very large tidal wavemoving quickly
through the Atlantic Ocean.It'll be 100 feet high,
traveling at 1,100 miles an hour.That's faster than the speed of sound.As the wave reaches shallow water
it's going to slow down,but the wave height, depending
on the depth of the shelf off the coast,will be anywhere from
1,000 to 3,500 feet high.Where the land is flat,
the wave will wash inland600 to 700 miles.(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)The wave will hit our nation's capital
40 minutes after impact.New York City, Boston,
Atlanta, Philadelphia,all will be destroyed.If you have any means of getting
away from the path of this wave,leave now.The impact of the larger cometwill be nothing less
than an extinction-level event.It will strike land in western Canada
three hours after Biederman.Within a week, the skies
will be dark with dust from the impact,and they will stay dark for two years.All plant life will be dead withinfour weeks.Animal life withina few months.So that's it.Good luck to us all.Could I bother everyone for a minute?
Now, let's take a look at the big one.Now, the out-gassing has created a vent
a half a mile wideand at least 2 miles deep.
Comet gets closer to the sun,sun melts ice, ice turns to steam,
we get a big hole. Okay?So, how many nukes
we have left in the back?Four.Okay. If we can get
the remaining bombs in that vent,there shouldn't be anything left
of that comet bigger than a suitcase.Now, we can't do anything
about the little one,but, you know,
it just might give them a chance.Now, without the arming codes,
we're gonna have to waitto set the bomb timers until
we get closer to Earth to raise Houston.We may not have enough
life support leftto get back into the cargo bay
for the nukes,much less to work down on the comet.And we sure as hell don't have
enough propellant left in the Messiahto maneuver with.How are we supposed to get back
off the surface once we've...Once we've gone down there?We don't.Well, you look at the bright side.We'll all have high schools
named after us.TANNER ON RADIO:

you got there.(BABY GURGLES)MARK: He's laughing.(LAUGHING)I can hear him. I know.Mariette, I'm hugging you both right now.I'm holding you.- ANDREA: Twenty-five seconds.
- Prepare to synchronize the nukes.Twenty-three, 22, 21,20, 19, 18,17, 16, 15...It's been a pleasure serving
with you, Commander.The honor's all mine, Andy.MONASH: Be good, Oren.Be good.(MARIETTE SOBBING)(RUMBLING)(BOTH PANTING)BECK: We watched as the bombs
shattered the second cometinto a million pieces of ice and rockthat burned harmlessly
in our atmosphereand lit up the sky for an hour.Still, we were left
with the devastation of the first.The waters reached as far inland
as the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.It washed away farms and towns,forests and skyscrapers.But the water receded.The wave hit Europe and Africa, too.Millions were lost,countless more left homeless.But the waters receded.Cities fall,but they are rebuilt.And heroes die,but they are remembered.We honor them with every brick we lay,with every field we sow,with every child we comfort
and then teach to rejoicein what we have been re-given.Our planet.Our home.So now, let us begin.(ALL CHEERING)

It was the nicest little
whorehouse you ever saw.<i>It lay about a mile
outside the city limits,</i><i>so everybody could
feel real friendly.</i><i>Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace picked it
out for Miss Wulla Jean in 1910,</i><i>and she moved there
with her girls from over</i><i>the hardware
store on Main Street.</i><i>âª Oh, the little house lay</i><i>âª In a green Texas glade</i><i>âª Where the trees
were as coolin'</i><i>âª As fresh lemonade</i><i>âª Soft summer wind</i><i>âª Had a trace of perfume</i><i>âª And a fan was turnin'</i><i>âª In every room</i><i>âª 20 fans were turnin'
They were turnin'</i><i>âª 20 fans were
turnin' in every room</i><i>âª Fevers were a-burnin'
They were burnin'</i><i>âª And they had to
have a way to cool down âª</i><i>FRED". Right from the beginning,</i><i>the little house
was kinda special,</i><i>like a home away from home.</i><i>Miss Wulla Jean
put a pianola in the</i><i>parlor to sorta
help break the ice.</i><i>A feller could
ask</i> a <i>girl to dance,</i><i>or if he held back a little,
she'd ask him.</i><i>And pretty soon they'd
get a little business goin'.</i><i>Two dollars' worth.</i><i>Yah-hoo!</i><i>It wasn't long
before the place became</i><i>one of the better known pleasure
palaces in all of Texas.</i><i>So much so that the fellers who
visited during World War I</i><i>sent their sons
back in World War ll.</i><i>The hospitality and
friendliness never changed,</i><i>and neither did Miss Wulla
Jean's strict set of rules.</i><i>She liked her ladies,
as she called 'em,</i><i>to treat her
customers real good,</i><i>but never in an unladylike</i> way.<i>And she insisted that each girl</i><i>check her gentleman for the clap</i><i>and wash him off with
soap and warm water.</i><i>Some of the fellers claimed
that that was the best part!</i>Ooh-ee!<i>It was only during
the Hoover depression</i><i>that the little house
had a spell of tough times.</i><i>Miss Wulla Jean put in a
jukebox to spark up business.</i><i>But it wasn't always easy in them
days to come up with hard cash.</i>Well... You just
keep that in the bag,and I'll take it out back
as soon as we're finished.<i>So fora while,
as the story goes,</i><i>the girls began
accepting poultry in trade.</i><i>One bird, one lay.</i><i>And that's how
the place got its name.</i><i>The Chicken Ranch.</i><i>Of course, if you grew
up anywhere in Texas,</i><i>you knew at an early age they was
sellin' somethin' out there,</i><i>and it wasn't poultry.</i><i>âª 20 fans were turnin'

for over three generations,</i><i>the Chicken Ranch went
peacefully about its business,</i><i>while the people here in
Gilbert went about theirs.</i><i>That is,
until about seven years ago.</i><i>I was a deputy back then,</i><i>workin' for
Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd.</i>You wanted me to remind you
about your 2:00 appointment.<i>FRED".
That was right after I had</i><i>lost the fried chicken
franchise here in town,</i><i>while Ed Earl had
been Sheriff ever</i><i>since old Jack
Roy Wallace retired.</i><i>Everybody liked Ed Earl,</i><i>especially Ed Earl.</i><i>Course,
he sure did know his job,</i><i>and he was a big
influence on me,</i><i>taught me everything I know.</i><i>He used to like to
run a quiet town,</i><i>with plenty of time
off for socializin'</i><i>and coffee over at
Dulcie Mae's cafe.</i><i>Oh, now and again
there'd be a problem,</i>and we had some <i>tough</i> ones.
Right in front of my car!<i>Like the time the mule
sat on Miss Modene's car.</i>He just buckled up
his legs and sat right down!<i>She was really
havin'</i> a <i>hissy fit,</i><i>but it didn't faze Ed Earl.</i><i>He just walked over to that
jackass and laid down the law.</i><i>You see, Ed Earl always
believed in talkin' first.</i><i>Cool reasonin', he used to tell
me, could solve any problem.</i><i>Course he did have
a bit of a temper.</i><i>Anyway, just about
the time he became sheriff,</i><i>Miss Wulla Jean passed on.</i><i>She left the Chicken Ranch to her
favorite workin' girl, Mona Stangley,</i><i>who saw the little house
as a Texas institution</i><i>and aimed to keep it that way.</i><i>âª It's just</i> a<i>âª Little bitty

along fine, just like always,</i><i>until that famous
college football celebration.</i><i>Some folks think that that's
when the trouble started.</i>You see, for years,
the winning seniorsof the Texas Aggies-Texas U
football game at Thanksgiving,they were treated to a night
out at the Chicken Ranchby their alumni association.But actually,
the real trouble startedbrewin' about three days before.I can't tell you how
thrilled we are with your contribution.Here's your receipt.
Thank you, Rita.Those kids'll be so excited,
and the mayor, too.Why, the town council will
probably vote you another plaque.Lord, I hope not. I got
a closet full of 'em now.Hello, Dulcie Mae.
You know Miss Mona.Oh, yes, of course!
We've met. Mornin'.Good mornin'.Isn't this wonderful?Miss Mona has just
capped the goal forthe Little League fund campaign.Oh, how nice!Well, on behalf of my son and his
teammates, I wanna thank you.You tell them I'll be
well repaid when theytake the championship next year.Goodbye, Rita.I'm sorry the sheriff
wasn't here to thank you.He drove over to Meritsville.
He'll be gone all afternoon.Well, you tell him I said hi.
Bye.Bye.Bye.Hey, Miss Mona.How are you doin', Deputy Fred?It's nice to see you.It's good to see you. Keepin'
an eye on my place at night?Sure are. The Sheriff's real
particular about security out there.Well, one of these nights when you
ain't on duty, you drop in out there.My girls would love to show
you a little appreciation.Shoot, Miss Mona. You know
I'm a married man!Oh, Fred, you mean to
tell me you don't thinkthe cows don't
appreciate the time offwhen a bull goes
over to another pasture?Miss Mona!See you later, Miss Mona.
Okay. Goodbye.Damn it!What's the matter?You're in bed already. So?So, I told you 100 times,watching you get
undressed is the best part.The best part?Well, maybe not the best part,
but in the top two.Now, would I wanna disappoint
my little honey?Whoo! Ah. I'm glad I was late.Me too! You just hold your horses.
I got a surprise for you.I went by the post
office this morning.I picked up a package. The very latest
thing from Frederick's of Hollywood.Yeah?
Just a little something sexyI thought you might like.What do you think? Little?It don't look too little to me.Well, it certainly
ain't a trainin' bra,but I do believe
I can fill it out.I don't think you
got any problem there.I'll be back with more.You know, Mona,I've known a lot
of women in my life.None of 'em has ever been
exciting to me like you are.Really? Even after all these years
we've been meetin' like this?I'll tell you something.A year with you is like
a minute of sheer happiness.Well, now, that is just about the
sweetest thing anybody ever said to me.I know.You know, honey,you bring out the...
The romantic in me.Tah-dah!Whoo! You did that real fast.Well, honey,
I've had a lot of practicegettin' in and
out of my clothes.How do you like the outfit?Hot damn.Makes me feel real sexy.Whoo.Well, you don't look real sexy.What do you mean?
I look like I always look.That's just it.It's them damn
droopy boxer drawers.I just hate
the looks of them things.I've worn boxer
shorts for years!And they look like it.These are a brand-new pair.I don't know what you're talkin'
about, "I don't look sexy."People tell me I have a real
sexy quality about me.Well, you do,
but them boxer shorts don't.But when I was gettin' me some
sexy things, I thought about you,because they have a his 'n' hers
sexy department at Frederick'sand I thought you
might try that on for size.What the hell is it,
a Japanese slingshot?No, it's jockey shorts with
little silver snaps on the side.Mmm. Little is the key word here.
They are real little.In fact, a guy could hurt
himself wearin' those things.I don't think so,
thank you very much.Ed Earl, I paid $20 for these, plus
postage. And I want you to wear it.Aw, you paid $20 for these?Yes!Well, you got screwed.Come on, Ed Earl!No!If they look half as good on you
as I think they're going toyou ain't gonna have to
wear 'em but a second.Maybe less.They're ridiculous.
They're impossible.They're sexy.No, no, no!Well, fine! Then I'm gettin'
dressed and goin' home.Well, fine! I'm goin' in the
bathroom and... Put these on.Be like puttin' two bowling
balls in a marble bag.Braggin', braggin', braggin'.Well, I saw Dulcie
Mae in town today.Oh, yeah?I guess you'll be goin' over
there for Thanksgivin' dinner.Don't I always?You know, you better check
that turkey of hers,because there's a hook
in there that's gonnadrag your ass to
a wedding chapel.No way.I don't believe in matrimony.
It screws up a relationship.Amen to that, Ed Earl.Ready?Oh, I'm always ready.Well, hellfire. Ls that it?How'd you like it?I didn't hardly
get to even see them!That's all you're gonna see,'cause I ain't gonna parade
around like no model.Aw, come on, Ed Earl. For me.No! No.Come on. One itsy-bitsy peek?What are you doin'? Man!Now, that's what the
little silver snaps are for.Work, don't they?Just like a snap.Come on over here and give me
a little lip-lock.Oop. Gotta brush my teeth.Ah.You know how I am
about my breath.Oh, Ed Earl, I like
a lot of things,but these afternoons with you
have got to top the list.Yeah?
Well, sing it to me, honey.<i>âª I like fancy, frilly things</i><i>âª High-heel shoes

All this time Miss Monawas at the back
knockin' on the screen door.She said she's in a real big hurry but
just dropped by to give you this.It's a Japanese slingshot.Well, look at that! At last!Okay, Rufus.
What's on your mind?Something that
could have seriousimplications to
the health of this town!Tell him, C.J.!
Just like you told me.Well, Sheriff, I have this friend
that works in a TV stationdown in Houston.He tipped me off
that Melvin P. Thorpe'splannin' an expose
on the Chicken Ranch.Who?Melvin P. Thorpe!He's that crazy
consumer advocate.Has a report on
the late night news.He's got a new show now,
a half hour once a week,<i>The Watchdog Report.</i>
It's <i>on tonight.</i>The Chicken Ranch on TV.
Now, come on, fellas.Television is a family medium.But he's a sensationalist,
Ed Earl.He shows up with his TV cameras every
time a consumer has a complaint.He's a menace to
the business community.He's that feller that put the
peanuts back in the chocolate bar.What?He made the makers of the
Peanut Delight candy baradmit that they put less peanutsin each bar than
they advertised.He made them change their ways.Sounds like a tough customer.He's got a lot of
influence out there.If he brings cameras out
to the Chicken Ranch...Come on, Rufus!
I'll make some phone calls.I got a little influence
around this state myself.Well, it's no use talkin'
to me about it, Sheriff!Melvin P. Thorpe is now the biggest
attraction at this station.High ratings. Lots of letters.
He doesn't listen to anybody.Hell, he wants to go national!Wants to be watchdog
for the whole U.S. of A.Love to help you, Ed Earl,but just like you don't want to
mess with the Chicken Ranch,I don't wanna ruffle
this old bird's feathers.Here in Houston, he's becomin'
a regular Texas attraction.Well, now, wait a minute,
Ed Earl.I'd tread easy on this one. Them
TV boys can be mighty powerful.And mighty useful,
if you get my meaning.Senator, roll call.Excuse me, Ed Earl. I gotta go.It's that damn
bilingual bullshit again.Let me give you
a word of advice fromone elected official to another.Be careful of the box.Son of a bitch.
What the hell's going on?This goddam Melvin P. Thorpe's
got the whole state bamboozled.This is serious, Ed Earl.
You gotta do something.I intend to.Deputy Fred. I want you to hold
down the fort for a while.Me? Yeah, you.Where you goin'?I'm goin' to Houston.
I'm gonna take careof that little
pecker wood myself.This is it. Thank you.Come in.Mr Thorpe?I know you.You do?Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd. They told
me you were here. Come on in.I hope I'm not...Interrupting anything.Oh, please!
It's my pleasure, my honor.What brings you here to Houston?Sit down. Anywhere over here.I, uh....
I'm gettin' dressed.Sit down.
I've got my TV show to do,and I'm runnin'
a bit behind time.It's your show I want
to talk to you about, Mr Thorpe.Oop. Melvin.Melvin.Please. You watch the show, Ed?Last week Well...was the best ratin' we ever had.The city planning commissioner
was drivin' a city car...Just hold that for me, will you?While he was on vacation.
Caught him dead to rights.That pitiful putz.
Would you just pull that up?What? Just pull that up.And we broke a 30 share.It's affectin' my pieces
on the late night news.Up, up, up. They just
love my little report.I hear you're very popular.The power of television, of public
exposure, is so great it scares me.I swear, I could get the
mayor's own childrento throw rocks at him.Which show did
you like best, Ed?I think the one about the...Nuts in the chocolate bar.That's one of my favorites."Threescore" means 60,
like the Bible says.So, if it says "60
nuts" on the wrapper,I wanna see 60 nuts inside.And I'm talkin' full nuts.
I'm not talkin' a half nut,or nut bits or nut chips.I'm talkin' a full nut.I can see that.Thank God we still live in
a society where anythingthat's phony or dishonest
can't stand the light of day.Sock. Beg your pardon?Uh, sock.Thank you. Yeah.Most corporations involved
in false advertisin'would just laugh at a $50 fine.But you show up
with your TV cameraand give them
a little bad publicityand they shape up faster than goose
shit slides through a tin horn.Well, Melvin, it's that bad publicity
I want to talk to you about.That could hurt people.
You take that reportyou're doin' on
the Chicken Ranch.That place is older
than rocks and water.I wouldn't be surprised if your
granddaddy took your daddy out thereto learn about
the birds and the bees.I'm from New Jersey.See, I moved to Houston six years ago.Texas suits my style.The point I'm tryin' to make isthat every schoolboy in
the state knows about it.Most of the politicians
have slept there.And the mayor and the people of
my county that voted for me,they want to keep
things just the way they are.Hmm. You know something,
Sheriff, it just struck me.We are in the same profession.What's that?Law enforcement.I'm out there fightin' for the
rights of the public, just like you.Both of us are interested
in protectin' the public.You in the old way,
and me in the new.Uh-huh. The new?Television.I'm the electronic
bounty hunter.I use a camera, you use a gun.Yeah.Well, Melvin,
everybody'd be happyif you'd just drop
the whole thing.Ah.I mean, those ladies out there,they perform
a necessary function.I mean, right or wrong...Right or wrong
don't interest me!I'm no moralizer. I leave
all that to the preacher.Well, I'm glad.Anyway, the mayor was
thinkin' maybeyou'd want a little
unnecessary publicity.Unnecessary publicity?
He's got me all wrong!I'm not one of those sensation
mongers out to boost his own ego!Clear.How do you like it?It's different.I designed this myself.No, you tell your mayor he's got
nothing to fear from me on that score.He'll be happy to hear that.I'm a lawman.
That's my interest.The law, right, partner?20 seconds, Mr. Thorpe.Oh, I'm on!
Friend Ed, I gotta go.That's my cue.Come on!<i>Apres vous!</i>Come to think of it, I'd love
to do an interview with you.I don't think I'm the type.Oh, nonsense! You're exactly what
the public would like to see.Really? We'll discuss
it after the show.I want you to be my guest.This is the sponsor's booth.Just go in there,
make yourself comfortable.Make yourself to home.
See you later, partner.Thank you.<i>DOGETTES".

Because I trust you.Mmm. 'Cause you're my protector.Do you know he wears

clears out of the air.You're probably right.Well, ain't I always?Mmm-hmm.What? You know what I

Keep a grip on yourself.Don't get your back up!Stop whimperin', Rufus.Well, if it isn't
the man himself.Would you care to give me
an interview now, Sheriff?I'm gonna give you 30 seconds,
you fancified fart.Get you and your singin'
chorus the hell out of town!Now, wait a minute.And get those cameras and the
rest of that crap off the street.You're blockin' traffic!The only traffic we are blockin'is that headed out
for the Chicken Ranch.Right, Sheriff?Little fat buddy,
up to now you got two tickets.One for paradin' without a license
and the other for insultin' me.Now, you better get that
travellin' circus out of townor I'm gonna lock you up so
fast your corset's gonna pop!Oh, yeah? We're
perfectly within the law.As a newsman, I have
First Amendment protection.Get this.The public has a right to know
what is goin' on out thereand what kind of pay-off
you're acceptin' to protectthat notorious
house of ill repute.Ooh!First thing. First thing is you're
standin' in Lanville County,which, by my figurin',
is about a 100 miles westof that stink hole
you call Houston.So I can't see
it's any of your businesswhat goes on out here.Oh, yeah? Please...Number two. You ain't the
law around here and I am.So don't be tellin' me what
my goddamn job is,or I'll whip your butt so bad it'll
look like the stripes on a barber pole.Get him, Sheriff.May be mean, but he's ours!Number three.
No sawed-off little peckeris gonna accuse me of takin' a
bribe and live to tell about it'cause I wear the badge
in this goddamn county.So you listen and listen good, you
over-padded, televisin' turd.If I ever see you or any
of those little bastardsthat work for you
in my town again,I'm gonna knock you
so flat you're gonnahave to roll down
your socks to shit!That's tellin' him, Sheriff!Oh, my goodness!So get outta here, you goddamn,wig-wearin',
citified son of a bitch!Holy shit!
Oh, my God, that man's crazy!Oh! Ooh.Move, you schmuck!Move it! Come on!Get outta here! Move this thing!Come on, move this thing!
I'll get you for this.You son of a bitch!
You'll pay for this.You're in trouble, Sheriff!
You're in big trouble!So long, partner.Boy, you sent him hightailin'.
I was so proud of you!Didn't I? Yeah.Mmm-hmm.Look at them stars.Mmm.Well, there ain't nothin'
prettier than a Texas sky.Ain't that the truth.Hey, look! Did you
see that shootin' star?Mmm-hmm.Yeah. That could've been
a spaceship, you know.You believe in spaceships?Sure.I saw a picture once.Them fellers that's supposed
to be from up there.Fly around. Uh-huh.Tiny little fellers,
bald-headed.Little feet,
little hands, got no peckers.Got no peckers?Well, I ain't interested.I don't think my
girls would be either.When I was a little kid, I
used to imagine a flyin' saucerswoopin' down and pickin' me up
and takin' me off to heaven.Like the angels.Mmm-hmm."L looked, and behold, a whirlwind
comin' out of the north."And out of the midst
of the fire came the"likeness of four
living creatures."What the hell you talkin' about?Well, that's from the Bible.That's what the Bible says
about spaceships in Ezekiel.Don't you know
nothin' about the Bible?Yeah, I know about the Bible!I just don't know nothin'
about no Ezekiel in the Bible.I knew Ezekiel Peebles
once in the eighth grade.Think I busted his jaw.Mmm.Well, that was
very Christian of you.Well, most of my
family was Baptist.Well, I never stayed
with one family long enoughto become
anything in particular.But I read the Bible.
I believe in Jesus.I think Jesus was...Was a real good man.And he was a heck of a speaker.Yep. I knew a woman once
that had a vision of Jesus.He came right in her house, set
right down at the foot of her bed.Mmm-hmm?I don't know what I'd do
if that happened to me.I'll tell you something, honey.If Jesus comes to your house,
all hell's gonna break loose.You got a point there, Ed Earl.But you know,
Jesus was really goodto Mary Magdalene,
the fallen woman.He was always
bein' very sociable.He went to this big weddin'
once and they ran out of wine.You know what he did?
Turned the water into wine.Well, that's a man that knows
how to throw a party.Now, don't be sacrilegious.I'm not.
I'm not. He forgives me.He knows I was kiddin'.Yeah, I know he forgives you.That's funny, now,
how God can forgive you,and people can't.
Now why is that?Well, because people are not
very God-like, Mona.I know.I know.Yeah.What is it?Melvin P. Thorpeis a sorry son of a bitch.You reckon he's gonna
run for the legislature?Why?I never told
anybody this, Mona, but...I was thinkin' of runnin'
for the legislature someday.Are you serious, Ed Earl?Yeah.They say an honest man can't be
elected in this country anymore.But I don't believe that.This is a good country.I believe I could win.Well, you got my vote.
I might even go register.Boy, I sure didn't know
you had dreams that big.Hmm.People really do
like you, though.They like you, too.Really? Sure.You ask anybody
in town about you.Say,
"How do you like Miss Mona?"They say, "Shoot, she's a fine woman.
Fine, friendly and nice."Huh.Well, I always just thought if you
see somebody without a smile,you give 'em yours.I like that.I like that.Think I'll use that
as my campaign slogan.If you see somebody without
a smile, give 'em yours.I'm gonna have that
printed up on a little card.Oh, you're kiddin' me.
You smart-ass.I had a dream once.Yeah?I'll tell you if
you won't laugh.Oh, I won't laugh.Well, I used to dream
of bein' a ballerina.Now, Ed Earl,
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.A ballerina?Yes, a ballerina!Well,
I think that's wonderful.And I think you still could be a
ballerina if you wanted to be.No, you could!
Oh, don't be ridiculous!Go into training right now.
Just start jumpin' up and down.Me? Jumpin' up and down?
I'd black both my eyes.I couldn't be a ballerina now.
I'm too top-heavy.I have a hard enough
time balancin' thesethings now,
without gettin' on my toes.You know something?What?You know that, uh, I don't
see anybody but you anymore.Course, now, you can't
say the same, can you?I haven't been to bed with another
woman besides you in three years.You didn't know that, did you?No, I didn't know that.Nothin' better,
once you've had the best.Hey, I like that.Mmm. I thought you would.Reckon if I was to
run for the legislature,I could, uh,
put that on my card?Up next, Melvin P. Thorpe continues
his expose of the Chicken Ranch<i>with a violent demonstration
in the Gilbert town square.</i>Great God from Goldsboro!Oh. Yeah?Ed Earl,
you better turn on Channel 4.<i>That Melvin P. Thorpe idiot's
got you on TV again.</i>Well, I don't give a shit,
Rufus!<i>It's all very well to
take that attitude, Ed Earl,</i><i>but this is serious! Honey.</i>Put on the television.
Channel 4.That Melvin P. Thorpe is
shootin' off his mouth again.How could what he's sayin'
be so goddamn important?Calm down, Rufus! It can't
be as bad as all that.<i>What happened to me as an
individual is not important.</i><i>Is this the kind of man we want
runnin' our law enforcement?</i><i>Is this the kind of
foul-mouthed example</i><i>we wanna set for our young,
innocent children?</i><i>Run the film.</i><i>Number three.
No sawed-off little</i><i>is gonna accuse me of takin' a
bribe and live to tell about it</i><i>because I wear the badge
in this county!</i><i>So you and you listen good!
You!</i><i>If I ever see you or
any of those</i><i>that work for you
in my town again,</i>I'm gonna <i>knock</i> you so flat
you're gonna!Ed Earl, that man has
made a fool out of you.I've had
calls from four preachers,six deacons, and the presidents
of two garden clubs!Thank you for callin'.The phones have
been ringin' like thatall mornin' long.
Sheriff's office.I don't know why I let people
talk me into serving as mayorof this
incorporated sand trap anyway!What in the heck is keepin' him?He'll be along.Well, he'd better!My wife couldn't believe
what she saw last night.They bleeped him out,
but she read his lipson every "hell,"
"goddamn," and "shit."There's some folks gettin' up a
petition to close the Chicken Ranch.All we wanted to do
was keep it quiet.Now, thanks to Ed Earl,
it's the hottest thingon the air since The Gong Show.I'll tell him you called.
Bye. Mornin', Sheriff.Mornin', Rita.
Here's your calls.Reckon you fellas are
waitin' to talk to me.We sure are!You don't know
the trouble you causedon this Chicken Ranch business!Dad-gum it, Ed Earl! If you
ain't a pluperfect fool!You may be right.
I got over a dozenmessages here from
outraged citizens,tellin' me that we got a
whorehouse in Lanville County.Only been one here
for about 150 years.Ed Earl, now, you can set up speed
traps to catch the tourists.You can look the other way when the
wrong kid swipes a car to go joyriding.Hell, you can even let Miss
Mona run her place out there!But there's one thing you can't do and
that's broadcast gutter talk on TV.I didn't know they
was takin' pictures.What did you figure
the cameras were for?Damn it, C.J.!
You pious pissant.I don't have one-tenth the trouble
from Miss Monâªs that I have from youfor one of your all-night stag parties
over at the Legionnaire Hall.That ain't fair, dang it!There's just one thing to do.And that's close
the place down beforewe all go to hell
in a hand basket.Close it down! She was just fine as
long as she was bringin' in the moneyand makin' civic contributions,but the moment her luck ran sour,
you want to run out on her.Run out on her like
rats from a burnin' barn!That's just it, Ed Earl.
Who's gonna put out that fire?Look, if you won't
close her down, at leasttell her to lay low
for a couple of months!Yeah, just until the heat
wears off a little bit.Give it two months.
What's two months?Nobody tells me how
to run my goddam job,and nobody gives me advice!I'll do things my own way. I'm
gonna make up my own damn mind!Two months. What's two months?Shut down for two months!That is a hell of a lot
to ask somebody, Ed Earl.And that's a hell
of a lot of overheadto pay out when
cash ain't comin' in.What d'you think I
ought to tell my girls?Well, maybe it won't
be two months.The holidays are comin' up.Maybe in a couple of weeks the
whole thing will blow overand then you can let
your regular customers...I warned you yesterday about losin'
your temper and carryin' on.Last night you said
you was proud of me.Last night I wasn't
on the 11:00 news!Well, I didn't know that son of a bitch
was gonna make an idiot out of me.I don't know anything about
that electronic bullshit!How was I supposed to
handle that situation?That's your job, Ed Earl. Ain't
that what they pay you for?I know what my job is! Don't be
tellin' me what my goddamn job is!I could close this place down
in a New York minute!All I'm askin' for is for you
to give me a little cooperationso I can get through
a difficult situationwith as little
trouble as possible!Okay, okay, okay!
I'll shut it down.You will?What do you want,
a written contract?You promise?Ed Earl,
I am givin' you my word.I'm sorry, Mona,
about the whole situation.Don't feel sorry for me.I started out poor, and I
worked my way up to outcast.I know what I'm
askin' you to do is gonnaturn out to be
the best thing for both of us.Just trust me.You know what burns my ass?What?A flame about three feet high.Of course I trust you, you big cowboy.
Ain't I always?Mmm-hmm.No need to stop now.Now get out of here.Everything's gonna
turn out just fine.Don't you worry
about a thing, honey.Everything's gonna turn out
slicker than cat shiton a linoleum floor.Well, if it ain't the celebratedcussin' sheriff
of Lanville County.How are you, Sheriff?I'm fine. How are you, Porky?Oh, Sheriff! I been real good all week.
I've lost six pounds.Oh, yeah? Well, don't take
nothin' off them cheeks.Oh, go on.Whoa!Well, Jewel,
I just promised the sheriffthat we're gonna shut
down for two months.What? How can you promise that?What about the football game
celebration tomorrow night?I forgot all about that.It's the Thanksgiving game, Miss Mona.
And that's real special.Well I know it's special, Jewel!But I don't know what to do now.I did promise.You think if we just close the
doors to the regular customers,just went on with the party as
planned, that'd be all right?I'm sure it will, honey. That party
is a bigger tradition than the game.65,000-plus on hand
here at Kyle Field,and we have seen
an amazing ball game.Texas A&M heavily favored,
but we're tied 12-12.<i>Aggies have the ball,
second down at eight.</i><i>Time is winding down.</i><i>They try the
middle of the Texas defense,</i><i>and again, the Longhorns'
break is stopped.</i><i>This University
of Texas defense...</i>Whoo!Whoo!We string up the white firstand after we see who wins, we put
up the orange or the maroon.Yes, mâªam.I can't stand it
if them Aggies win.What do you mean?They're such animals. Always
yellin' and jumpin' aboutand sayin' "yee-haw!"If they have to go for
all the marbles,they will have to throw to
the end zone right now.<i>Time running out. Miller rolls
to the right. Pass! Touchdown!</i>Yeah!Hell! That calls for a drink.<i>Talk about the part</i><i>that emotion plays
in a game like this!</i>Don't let your
mother see you do that.Well, who won?The Aggies.Aw, Shit.Yee-haw.Yee-haw!Yee-haw!Hey, boys!All right! Hey, boys!Boys, boys!
That was the greatest victorysince General Eisenhower won!Senator, you ain't
forgot you was gonnatake us to
the Chicken Ranch, did ya?Yeah! How about it?I always keep my
campaign promises, hmm?Yes, sir. The Chicken Ranch
is a fine institution,and I'm proud to
have it in my district.And to hell with what
Melvin P. Thorpe says!I'll see all you

kid playin' at bein' a man!I don't have to listen to this shit.
Damn it! I'm the law.If I choose to, I'll close this
place down till hell freezes over.Don't you threaten me. I'm tellin'
the truth, and you know it!And all of your big dreams
of goin' to the legislature.That's all they are.
They're just dreams,'cause you ain't never gonna be
no more than you are right now.A chicken-shit sheriff
in a chicken-shit town.You may be right.It's a hell of a lot
better than bein' a whore.<i>Legalized prostitution, pro
or con, is in the news today.</i><i>For a report, here is Jeff
Gerald in Gilbert, Texas.</i>The Chicken Ranch, the legendary,
long-running bawdy house,is showing little activity
after the disclosure yesterdayof the Thanksgiving night raid.Get away!<i>The deputy at the front
gate keeps away onlookers</i><i>and potential customers,</i><i>while up at the house,
the doors are closed</i><i>and the principals
are not talking.</i><i>The sheriff of Gilbert, Ed
Earl Dodd, refused interviews,</i><i>while in Houston, the man
who launched the campaign,</i><i>consumer advocate Melvin P.
Thorpe,</i><i>held a press
conference this afternoon.</i>I have a report here that
says that the Chicken Ranchis involved with and under the
influence of organized crime.I myself am gonna take
this report to Austinin the hopes that
the Governor himselfwill come out of
his long silenceon this issue
and uphold the law.And... Thank you.
Thank you very much.<i>GERALD". At the capitol today,
the Governor made no statement,</i><i>but Senator Charles Wingwood,</i><i>who was a principal figure
in the Watchdog news raid,</i><i>also held a press conference
explaining his involvement.</i>I have no independent recollection
of going to the Chicken Ranch.And I can only say,
as the most dedicatedanticommunist in
the state legislature,that I must have been druggedby communists or
communist sympathizersand placed there to harm
my reputation and good name.Reaction across
the state is split 50-50.But here in the town of Gilbert,the Chicken Ranch
has many supporters.I ain't never seen anything
bad come out of there yet,and I've lived here all my life.Why, they attract a lot of
business to the community.They pay their taxes.
Just like you and me!No one. No one was ever
forced to go up there.My Frank, when he was alive, used
to go up there every Saturday.I took it as a blessin'. Of course,
things were different then.Nowadays women enjoy doin'
that sort of thing themselves.At least, so I've been told.The Chicken Ranch?
I think it's a good idea.See, you take a lot of
young boysand they're gonna be out
there lookin' for women.If they can't find 'em,
they'll rape 'em.And if they don't do that, they'll
run to other women and get diseases!Those girls went to doctors.Although petitions are being
circulated to save the Chicken Ranch,already this bumper sticker is
beginning to appear around the state.<i>And so, as feminists
line up behind the bill</i><i>for the decriminalization
of prostitution</i><i>already in the legislature, while
traditionalists and fundamentalists</i><i>lobby for its defeat, the
fate of the Chicken Ranch</i><i>rests with the Governor,</i><i>who today, again,
was unavailable for comment.</i><i>Jeff Gerald,
ABC News, Gilbert, Texas.</i><i>Thank you, Jeff.
If there are further...</i>Well, I hate admitting
I was wrong, Miss Mona.But with television broadcasting
this from hell to breakfast,we should've done what the sheriff
said and kept this place closed.It was my fault, Jewel.
It was my decision.He ain't gonna be able to
stop it this time, is he?No. He'd like to,
but he's out of his league.He don't know how to fight 'em.He's just a good old boy that
ain't never gonna grow up.Honey, we see
everything in this profession.But one thing I ain't never seen,
man nor woman, is a grown-up.Don't be too hard on him.
He loves you.Well, he ain't never said it.Some men can't say the words,
honey.But that don't mean they
don't feel it in their heart.Well, it's just as
well anyhow, Jewel.I set my course a long time agoand I can't go changin' now.Well,
I don't know what to do.Seems like folks got nothin' else to
talk about but this Chicken Ranch mess.Like a broken record. Chicken Ranch,
Chicken Ranch, Chicken Ranch!And all of this bad publicity's
flat ruinin' business.I haven't sold a car in a week.It's ruinin' the town.No one's blamin' you, Ed Earl.
It ain't your fault.But we can't just sit around
here waitin' to grow tits!Now, now, the way I see it, the
Chicken Ranch served a purpose once.But now everything's openin' up.Do you know we are in the middle
of a worldwide sexual revolution?Why, Miss Monâªs ain't obscene.
It's just obsolete.She ain't got a handful
of supporters left, Ed Earl.All this publicity's
makin' folks think twiceabout signin' that
petition to keep her open!Why the hell can't
that station in Houstonturn its cameras to the
cesspool in their own backyard?And how about Austin? Why, two
blocks from the state capitol,you can have
anything done to youfor money that you
can get in Tangier!Well, there's naked massages,
there's tongue baths,there's somebody ticklin'
your ass with a feather.If you know that for a fact,
Mr. Newspaper Editor,it's your duty to expose it!Well, now, you see here, C.J.!I don't give a damnif folks want their ass
tickled with a feather!I kind of like to think that
that's what heaven is all about.Boys, I got myself a pretty
good bullshit detector.And I can tell when
somebody's peein' on my bootsand tellin' me it's a rainstorm.Now, this thing's gotten way out of hand.
I don't know how.But I figure there's
only one thing left to do.Close it down!No. I'm goin' to Austin.See the Governor, tell him Miss
Monâªs side of the situation.He sure as hell ain't gonna hear
about it from anybody in this room.You can't go up
and see the Governor!He don't see anybody!He'll see me.Feel like
the country dog in the city.If I stand still, they screw me.If I run,
they bite me in the <i>ass.</i>I... I wishthere was somethin' I could do.Thank you.They want me to close her down,run her out of town.How can I ask her to leave when
all I want her to do is stay?Ladies and gentlemen, His
Excellency, the Governor of Texas.My friends, I want to thank youfor that sincere and
heart-warming ovation.No questions, please.Governor, what do you think of
the crisis in the Middle East?I was sayin' just this
morning at the weeklyprayer breakfast in
this historic capitolthat it behooves both
the Jews and the Arabsto settle their differences
in a Christian manner.But... Governor! Governor...Have you seen the evidence
of the disgraceful situationat the Chicken Ranch?<i>âª Fellow Texans I am proudly</i><i>âª Standing here to humbly say</i><i>âª I assure you</i><i>âª And I mean it</i><i>âª Now, who says I don't

Sheriff Dodd from Gilbertwaiting outside to see you.He's been here since early this
morning and is very insistent.Swearin' Sheriff Dodd?
The one on TV?No, no, no, no... Hi, Sheriff!Just talkin' about you.
How are ya?Governor. I know I'm way out of
line comin' up here like this,but before you closed
down the Chicken Ranch,I wanted you
to know all the facts.But I haven't made that
decision yet! Good.My aides are
still workin' on that.Well, the Chicken...The Chicken Ranch has been in my
county since before I was born.Its doors have been open to soldiers
and presidents and farmers.Even governors who can remember
what a great institution it is.No need to bring
that up, Sheriff.I ain't
threatenin' you, Governor.Whatever you say, I'm gonna do.But think of
the people out there.I've known Miss
Mona for 12 years.You're never gonna
meet a finer woman.She never refuses a charity.
The whole town likes her.Hospital fund, new swimmin'
pool, even the Little Leaguers.She bought 'em uniforms so they wouldn't
have to play in their overalls.Well.I wasn't aware of
her civic generosity.But the law is the law!Sometimes it's gotta be changed.I been fightin'
crime all my life,but let's not confuse crime
with committin' a sin.You can't legislate morality.Those girls out there have never
caused any trouble to anybody.They're healthy, taxpayin',
law-abidin' citizenswho supply
a demand and provide aneconomic asset to the community.Whew. Ed Earl.You ever think about runnin' for office?
Huh? I swear.You make that whorehouse
sound like adamn nonprofit
recreational facility.Governor, if
the citizens who elected mefound it necessary
for me to close it down,I would close it down.If Miss Mona and the girls that work
for her were jeopardizin' the health,wealth or moral scruples of the
community, I would close it down.If the place was just
a piddlin' nuisance,an eyesore, a fire hazard,
I would close it down!But there's nothin'.No reason except
the goddam criesof a muckrakin'
sensationalist on television.Here they are, Governor.
What you've been waitin' for.Aha. I'm sorry, Ed Earl.But the Chicken Ranch loses,
42 to 37, with 21 % undecided.What is that?The polls. You can't expect
me to go against the polls.This is what the people want.Melvin still outside? Maybe I can
catch the television camerasbefore they leave.
Good seein' ya.But it's not
what my people want.Shaw's over, Sheriff.
Close it down!Hooray! Aha!<i>âª Melvin Thorpe

Lanville County,it's my duty to tell you that...Why don't you just get
to the point, Sheriff?I gotta close you down.I see.How long do we have?<i>Be better to do it
as soon as possible.</i>I understand.Mona.About the other night.I lost my temper.I said some things
I shouldn't have said.I want to apologize.Oh, it's all right, Ed Earl.I think we both said a whole
lot of things we regret.<i>If there's ever
anything I can do...</i>No, thank you. I think
you've done all you could.I have to tell my girls.Well, the news has come.Just got a call
from the Sheriff,and we are closed down.Immediately and permanently.Oh. What'll we do?Well, Las Vegas, here I come.Damn! I thought
when the Sheriff wentup to Austin to
speak to the Governor,we'd get a reprieve.What did you say?Didn't you know
about that, Miss Mona?He drove up last night.The whole town's talkin' about
the way he fought for you.Didn't he tell you that?No. No, he didn't.<i>âª Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair</i><i>âª Maybe I'll move somewhere</i><i>âª Maybe I'll get a car</i><i>âª Maybe I'll drive so

day for Lanville County.It's kinda like
the end of an era.You know, like when you
graduate from high school?Things are just
never the same again.Ed Earl's up in
the state legislature now,and I became the Sheriff.I suppose you're wonderin'
what happened to Miss Mona.Well, Ed Earl drove up
there on her last day.Hey, Sheriff.Good morning, Jewel.I'm so pleased to see ya. I
knew you couldn't let me leavewithout a sweet
goodbye for your old Porky.Goodbye, Jewel.Goodbye, Sheriff.I sure hope you come up north
to visit Miss Mona and me.Where is she?Inside.See you're takin'
the old juke with you.You know I couldn't
leave without my bell and my box.Ed Earl?This old place looks
kinda funny, don't it?Ben Sawtuck bought all
my furniture and fixturesand Langston downtown
is gonna sell the rest.Mona, there's
something I wanna tell you.I want you to
thank your boys for me.Those sightseers and
reporters would havegot all out of
hand if it hadn't beenfor your deputies
down at the gate.Mona,
you know me better than that.Ed Earl, I believe
the thing for you to do isjust to put this
whole thing behind youjust as quick as you can.I've made a little money, I've laughed
some, I've danced to the music.It's just time to pay
the fiddler, that's all.Mona, we've been
together a long time.Sometimes I think you know me
better than I know myself.So you know how hard
this is for me to say.I love you.Will you marry me?Oh, Ed Earl, I've loved you
since I was 16-years-old.But I've thought about
this for a long time.And as much as I'd
love for it to work,I know deep down in my heart
it ain't never gonna be.Didn't you hear what I said?I did, darlin'.But it's gonna
always be just like it is.There just ain't no way
in this world it can work.We could make it work.Just have to give it a chance.<i>âª If I</i><i>âª Should stay</i><i>âª Well, I would only</i><i>âª Be in your way</i><i>âª And so I'll go</i><i>âª And yet, I know</i><i>âª That I'll think of you</i><i>âª Each step of the way</i><i>âª And I</i><i>âª Will always</i><i>âª Love you</i><i>âª I will always</i><i>âª Love you</i><i>âª Bittersweet</i><i>âª Memories</i><i>âª I guess that's all
I'll be takin' with me</i><i>âª Good-bye</i><i>âª Oh, please, don't cry</i><i>âª 'Cause we both know
that I'm not what you need</i><i>âª But I</i><i>âª Will always</i><i>âª Love you</i><i>âª I will always</i><i>âª Love you âª</i>I know you're
gonna get your dream.And I know you're gonna do a real
good job in the legislature.But if you was to marry me...Wait, a second.I love you.I don't give
a damn what people say.Jewel!
Hold it right there!What's that, Sheriff?Which one of them bags is hers?<i>That one.</i>And that one there, there...on, Sheriff!I always knew you'd
come through!On!<i>FRED". Well, that's pretty darn

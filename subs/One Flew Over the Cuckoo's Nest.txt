it is to meet you.-Sure. Pull up a chair, sit down, let's taIk.
-Sure.[CLEARS THROAT]R.P. McMurphy.That's a hell of a fish there, doc.-Isn't that a dandy?
-Yeah. It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?-No, 32.
-Thirty-two.I'll tell you,
it took every bit of strength I had......to hoId it while the guy
took the picture.Every damn bit.Probably that chain
didn't help it any either.You didn't weigh the chain,
did you, doc?No, I didn't weigh the chain, but damn,
I'm awfuI proud of that picture.That's the first Chinooker
I ever caught.-It's a nice one.
-Hmm.Randall Patrick McMurphy.Thirty-eight years old.Mm.What can you tell me about, uh......why you've been sent over here?Well, ahem, I don't know.What's it say there?-Mind if I smoke?
-No, go right ahead.Well, it, um......says several things here.Said you've been belligerent......talked when unauthorized......you've been resentful in attitude
toward work in general, that you're lazy.Chewing gum in cIass.[McMURPHY LAUGHS]The real reason
you've been sent over here......is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.-Yeah.
-To determine whether or not......you're mentally ill.-Uh-huh.
-This is the reaI reason.Why do you think
they might think that?[SIGHS]Well, as near as I can figure out,
it's because I, uh....Uh, fight and fuck too much.In the penitentiary?No, no, no, you mean why--
Wait--Why did you get sent over here
from the work farm?Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh. Uh....Well, I really don't know, doc.It says here that you went around---Let me just take a Iook.
-It ain't up to me, you know.One, two, three, four....-You've got at least five arrests for assault.
-Yeah.-What can you tell me about that?
-Five fights, huh?Rocky Marciano's got 40,
and he's a millionaire.-That's true.
-That is true.Of course, it's true that you went in
for statutory rape.That's true, is it not, this time?Absolutely true. But, doc......she was 1 5 years old
going on 35, doc......and, uh, she told me
she was 1 8, and she was......uh, very wilIing.
You know what l mean?-Mm. Mm.
-I practicalIy had to take......to sewing my pants shut.But, uh, between you and me, uh......she might have been 1 5.
When you get that Iittle red beaver......right up there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at aIl.-And I don't think you do either.
-I hear what you're saying.No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.Now they're teIling me
I'm crazy over here......because I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.It don't make a bit of sense to me.If that's what being crazy is......then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, wacko.But no more, no less. That's it.Well, to be honest with you,
McMurphy, what it says here......is that......they think....They think......you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.-What do you think about that?
-Do I look like that kind of guy to you, doc?Well....Let's just be frank for a minute,
Randall, if you would.Tell me......do you think there's anything
wrong with your mind, really?Not a thing, doc.I'm a goddamn marveI
of modern science.Well, you're gonna be here for a period
for us to evaluate you.-We're gonna study you.
-Mm-hm.We'll make our determinations
as to what, uh, we're going to do......and give you
the necessary treatment, uh...-...as indicated--
-Doc, Iet me just tell you this.I'm here to cooperate with you
1 00 percent.A hundred percent.I'll be just right down
the line with you. You watch.Because I think we ought to get
to the bottom of, uh, R.P. McMurphy.[EXHALlNG SHARPLY]INMATE:
Whoo!The scythe.INMATE: Oh.
-I'm awfully tired.WASHlNGTON: Sit down.
-I'm tired.Well, sit down.INMATE:
Oh.That better?[INMATE COUGHS]WASHlNGTON:
Mr. Ellsworth......you'lI wear yourself out.
Come here.Okay.RATCHED:
AIl right, gentIemen, let's begin.At the close of Friday's meeting......we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.Mr. Harding stated that his wife
made him uneasy......because she drew stares
from men on the street.-Is that correct, Mr. Harding?
-Yes. Uh, yes. That's correct.He also thinks he may have
given her reason......to seek sexual attention elsewhere,
but he wasn't abIe to say how.Mr. Harding has been heard
to say to his wife:"I hate you.
I don't ever want to see you again.You've betrayed me."So does anyone care
to touch on this further?[PAPER RUSTLlNG]Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?Are you sure?BiIly, how about you?No-- No-- No, ma'am.RATCHED: I'd like to write in my book
that you began the meeting.[INMATE COUGHS]RATCHED:
Just once.Mr. Martini?Are you with us?Yes.RATCHED:
Would you Iike to begin?Mr. Cheswick?-Me?
RATCHED: Yes.You mean there's not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter?[INMATE CLEARS THROAT]RATCHED:
AlI right.Mr. Harding......you've stated
on more than one occasion......that you suspected your wife
of seeing other men.Oh, yes. Yes, very much--
I suspect her.I suspect her.Well, maybe you can tell us why
you suspect her.Well, I can only......speculate as to the reasons why.Have you ever speculated,
Mr. Harding......that perhaps you are......impatient with your wife......because she doesn't meet
your mental requirements?HARDlNG: Perhaps, but you see,
the only thing I can really......speculate on, Nurse Ratched......is the very existence of my life,
with or without my wife......in terms of the human relationships,
the juxtaposition......of one person to another,
the form, the content.Harding, why don't you knock off
the bulIshit and get to the point?This is the point.This is the point, Taber.
It's not bulIshit.I'm not just taIking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life.I can't seem to get that
through to you.I'm not just taIking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody.I'm talking about form.
I'm talking about content.I'm talking about interreIationships.I'm talking about God, the devil,
helI, heaven.-Do you understand? Finally?
-Ha!Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.Oh. Oh.It makes me feel very pecuIiar,
very peculiar...-...when you throw in that.
-Peculiar?-Why?
-What does that mean, peculiar, Harding?-Peculiar? PecuIiar?
-Peculiar?SEFELT: Ha-ha-ha.
-I'm going to tell you guys something.You just don't wanna learn anything.You just don't want
to listen to anybody.He's got intelligence.You've never heard the word peculiar?
Say, what are you trying to say?You trying to say I'm queer?
Is that it?Little Mary Ann?
Little Marjorie Jane? Huh?That it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?Is that your idea of communicating
something?-Well, is it?
CHESWICK: Oh.They're aIl crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.-They're all ganging up on you.
-Is that news?No, they-- They sometimes wanna
gang up on me too, but I---Cheswick, do me a favor.
CHESWICK: What? Huh?-Take it easy.
CHESWICK: Take it--?-And stay off my side.
CHESWICK: But I only wanna--I only wanna help you.HARDlNG: l understand.
CHESWICK: Don't you want me to--?HARDlNG: Please.
CHESWICK: But I only wanna---Please.
-But l only wanna help you.Please!HARDlNG:
You see......the other day you made
some allusions, both of you.-Illusions?
HARDlNG: A sexual-- Yes, aIlusions.AlIusions. Not illusions. AlIusions......to sexuaI probIems
I might be having with my wife.AlI right, say it's true.
Say I know it to be true, but you don't.If that's your idea of trying
to tell me something--Harding, I think you're some
kind of morbid asshole or something.SEFELT: Peculiar.
-Asshole again.FREDRlCKSON:
It makes you feel peculiar.You been talking about your wife ever
since I can remember. She's on your mind.-Blah, blah, blah.
-I'm not talking about my wife.When are you gonna get that
through your head?When are you gonna wise up
and turn her loose?FREDRlCKSON: Please.
SEFELT: No, just peculiar.-I'm tired.
-I don't wanna hear it.-I don't wanna hear it.
BANCINl: I'm tired.CHESWICK: l don't wanna hear it.
-I'm tired.-It's a Iot of baloney.
CHESWICK: l don't wanna hear it.BANCINl:
It's a lot of baloney and l'm tired.CHESWICK: l don't wanna hear it.

It doesn't matter.--is the opening of the World Series.What l'd like to suggest is that

Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking......is that we change
a very carefuIly worked-out schedule.A little change never hurt, huh?
A little variety?Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.Change it now,

to the schedule after the Series.I'm talking about the WorId Series,
Nurse Ratched. Huh?Well, anyway, this is no way

I think I'd like to see one......and that would be good therapy, too,
wouIdn't it, Miss Ratched?I thought we'd decided that issue.Well, I don't think so,

I think, don't we, Mac?That's right, Ches, and we want

Sit down, will you?For chrissake.Cigarettes.Remember, Mr. Scanlon,

the prosecution 's case.Mr. Skinner, you've heard the tapes.Can you make a judgment
about its authenticity?I have no reason to beIieve
it isn't genuine.How did you test this tape?I took sampIes of the suspects. . .. . .comparing them to the tape
with an osciIIoscope.They matched.When this is over, remind me
to rip his tongue out.With a tow truck.When I entered the premises,
I saw the two suspects, the guns. . .. . .the money, the drugs, the dead body.When those guys showed up. . .. . .I figured it's aII gone sour.I was going to go and cIear
everything up. . .. . .when they kiIIed him.When this is over,

for me.

798
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,864
I like him,
and he will like me.

799
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,991
No.

800
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:37,286
He's like Bernardo, afraid.

801
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,040
Imagine being
afraid of you!

802
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,500
You see?

803
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,126
I see you.

804
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,671

âª What you say âª

828
00:58:56,241 --> 00:59:00,453
âª Today, all day,
I had the feeling âª

âª A miracle would happen âª

Tomorrow.

858
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:28,100
I work at the bridal shop
across the street. Madam Lucia's.

Where the devil
are them Sharks?

878
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,494
Maybe they're
too chicken
to show.

879
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,121
We got time, A-Rab.

880
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,372
Riff and Ice
ain't even here yet.

So marry him!

888
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,011
I ain't never gonna
get married. Too noisy.

889

You ain't never

Gee, could a real zip gun
make you do like that?

894
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,234
No, the zip gun
could make you do.
You better wear diapers!

895
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,529
Go walk the streets
like your sister.

896
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,491
Listen, jailbait,
I licked you twice,

Any sign of Tony?

Invisible, man.

What do you think
the Sharks are gonna ask for?

906
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:11,764
Mercy.

907
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:12,973
Just rubber hoses maybe.

Relax, little man.

When you was my age!

1109
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:29,284
When my old man was my age,
my brother was my age...

1110
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,912
You was never my age,
none of ya.

1111
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:35,415
And the sooner
you creeps get hip to that,
the sooner you'll dig us!

1112
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,126
I'll dig you an early grave,
that's what I'll dig.

Okay, Doc, set 'em up.

to business.

learned the procedures
of gracious living.

I don't like you,
either, so cut it.

Okay, kick it, Doc.

On what terms?

Whatever terms
you're callin'.

1125
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,629
You crossed the line
once too often.

1126
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:05,922
You started it.

1127
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,215
Who jumped Baby John
this afternoon?

1128

Who jumped me
the first day
I moved here?

1129

Who asked you to move here?
Who asked you?

1130

Back where you came from.

knows his own.

I'm calling
you all chicken!

Big, tough buddy boys
gotta throw bricks.
Afraid to get in close?

1159
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,341
Afraid to slug it out?
Afraid to use plain skin?

1160

Not even garbage?
That ain't a rumble.

Who says?
You said call weapons.

1162
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,265
A rumble
can be clinched
by a fair fight,

1163
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,392
if you've got
the guts to risk that.

1164
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,144
Best man from each gang
to slug it out.

1165
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,523
I would enjoy
to risk that.

1166
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,358
Okay. Fair fight.

1167
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,403
Wait a minute!
The commanders
say yes or no.

1168

Fair fight.

you will be like
a fish after skinning.

would be fighting with...

a couple of words from me

1261
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:23,289
Rosalia, Consuelo,
my adorable friends,
can you keep a secret?

1262
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:25,124
I'm hot for secrets.

1263
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,836
No. I won't tell you.

1264
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:30,963
What?
"What?"

1265
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,882
The poor girl is
out of her mind.

1266
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,425
I am! Crazy.

1267
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,595
She might be at that.
She looks
somehow different.

1268
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,013
I do?

1269
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:40,848
And I think she
is up to something.

1270
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,350
I am?

1271
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:45,520
CONSUELO: "I do? I am?"
She talks like a parrot.

1272
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:46,687
ROSALIA: What is
going on with you, Maria?

1273
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:47,772
(I FEEL PRETTY PLAYING)

1274
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,232
â« I feel pretty âª

1275
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:50,858
âª Oh, so pretty âª

1276
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:54,028
âª I feel pretty
and witty and gay âª

1277
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,571
âª And I pity âª

1278
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:58,366
âª Any girl who isn't me today âª

1279
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:01,869
âª I feel charming âª

1280
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,246
âª Oh, so charming âª

1281
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,249
âª It's alarming how charming I feel âª

1282
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,042
âª And so pretty âª

1283
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:10,962
âª That I hardly can believe I'm real âª

1284
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,551
âª See the pretty girl
in that mirror there? âª

1285
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:19,429
âª Who can that attractive girl be? âª

1286
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:21,722
âª Such a pretty face,
such a pretty dress âª

1287
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:24,016
âª Such a pretty smile,
such a pretty me! âª

1288
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,019
âª I feel stunning âª

1289
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:28,604
âª And entrancing âª

1290

âª Feel like running

âª For I'm loved âª

âª By a pretty wonderful boy âª

1293
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:44,412
âª Have you met my good friend Maria? âª

1294
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:47,290
âª The craziest girl on the block âª

1295
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,877
âª You'll know her
the minute you see her âª

1296
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:54,505
âª She's the one who is in
an advanced state of shock âª

1297
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,592
âª She thinks she's in love,
she thinks she's in Spain âª

1298
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:58,676
âª La la la âª

1299
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,929
âª She isn't in love,
she's merely insane âª

1300
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,265
âª It must be the heat âª

1301
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,683
âª Or some rare disease âª

1302

âª La la la âª

1303

1304
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,188
âª Or maybe it's fleas âª

1305
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,815
âª Keep away from her âª

1306
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,442
âª Send for Chino âª

1307
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,653
âª This is not the Maria we know âª

âª That the city
should give me its key âª

âª A committee âª

1320
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,139
âª Should be organized
to honor me âª

âª La la la la la la âª

âª Who can that

CÃ¡llate!
Por favor, muchachas!

1343
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,773
You want to sing,
do it with the needle,

1344
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,775
or you'll be out
singing for your supper!

1345
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:41,362
But Madam Lucia,
what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.

1346
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,446
Sure.

1347
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,907
You make the bad joke home
where I can't hear it.

1348
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,243
Go now. Go home.
It's closing time. Shoo!

1349
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,579
ALL:
Buenas noches, Madam Lucia.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1351
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,082
You put down the shades?
Yes.

1352
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,459
Turn off the lights,
and lock the doors.

1353
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:58,129
Buenas noches, Anita.

1354
01:26:58,255 --> 01:26:59,589
Buenas noches.

MARIA: AdiÃ³s.

1356
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,467
The jail is open.

1357
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,261
I thought
she'd never leave.

1358
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,388
It's hard to believe
that old bag of a witch

01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,472
(BELL RINGING)

1360
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:09,557
was once
a young bag like us.

1361
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,351
Let's go before
she changes her mind
and comes back.

1362
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:15,229
You go, querida.
I will lock up.

1363
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,606
ANITA: Why?

1364
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:17,773
I have work.

1365
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:19,317
ANITA: Do it tomorrow.

1366
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:20,901
I'm in no hurry.

1367
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:22,153
I am!

1368
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:25,615
I'm going home now
and take a nice,
long bubble bath.

1369
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:27,658
Black orchid.

1370
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,327
Black orchid?

1371
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,454
All over.

1372
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,165
I gotta date with Nardo
after the rumble.

1373
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,167
What rumble?

1374
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,502
Oh, well, um...

1375
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:41,714
Nardo's Sharks
and those boys
at the dance.

1376
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,175
They fight each other tonight?

1377
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,344
They don't play patsy.

1378
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,848
Why must they always fight?

1379
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,810
You saw how they dance,
like they gotta get
rid of something quick.

1380
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:56,771
That's how they fight.

1381
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,856
To get rid of what?

1382
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:02,818
Too much feeling.
And they
do get rid of it.

1383
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:06,614
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours
is so healthy.

1384
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:09,617
Definitely black orchid.

Buenas noches.

"You go, querida.
I will lock up."

Buenas tardes.

...buenas tardes.

He just came
from the drugstore
to deliver aspirin.

1393
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:42,983
You'll need it.

1394
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,695
Not us. We're fine.

1395
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,571
We're out of the world.

1396
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,198
You're out of your heads.

1397
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,409
We're 12 feet in the air.

1398
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,077
Anita can see that.

1399
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,875
You will not tell?

1400
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:04,630
Tell what?

1401
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:07,550
How can I know
what goes on 12 feet
over my head?

1402
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,555
You better be home in 15 minutes.

1403
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,816
It's all right.
She likes us.

1404
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,861
But she is worried,
and so am I.

1405
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,320
That's foolish.

1406
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:30,114
Are you going to
that rumble tonight?

1407
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,991
- No.
- Yes!

1408
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:33,659
Why?

1409
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:34,994
You must go and stop it.

1410
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:38,789
I have stopped it.
It'll only be a fistfight
between two of 'em. Nardo...

1411
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,000
Any fight is no good for us.

1412
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,043
Everything is good for us.
We got magic.

1413
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,045

Yes.

Who was the boy?

I didn't believe hard enough.

Loving is enough.

2217

Not here.

2218
02:22:37,341 --> 02:22:39,133
They won't let us be.

2219
02:22:39,885 --> 02:22:41,677
Then we'll get away.

2220
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:46,474
Yeah.

2221
02:22:46,892 --> 02:22:48,142
- We can.
- Yes.

2222
02:22:48,226 --> 02:22:49,602
- We will.
- Yes.

MARIA: Stay back!

2231
02:24:15,689 --> 02:24:18,023
How do you fire
this gun, Chino?

2232
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:21,444
Just by pulling
this little trigger?

2233
02:24:22,028 --> 02:24:24,405
How many bullets
are left, Chino?

2234
02:24:25,198 --> 02:24:26,741
Enough for you?

2235
02:24:26,908 --> 02:24:28,159
And you?

2236
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:31,245
All of you!

2237
02:24:31,496 --> 02:24:35,207
You all killed him,
and my brother, and Riff...

2238
02:24:35,834 --> 02:24:37,877
...not with bullets
and guns.

2239
02:24:38,628 --> 02:24:39,962
With hate!

2240
02:24:40,756 --> 02:24:44,508
I can kill, too,
because now I have hate!

2241
02:24:45,093 --> 02:24:48,012
How many can I kill, Chino?
How many?

2242
02:24:48,597 --> 02:24:51,265
And still have one bullet
left for me?

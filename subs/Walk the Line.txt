than in Heavenly Highway Hymns.Look, J.R., if I'm gonna be
a preacher one day......I gotta know the Bible
front to back.I mean, you can't help nobody
if you can't tell them the right story.They said by noon it's gonna be 104.Them radio stations say anything
to get them niggers off.Ray, why don't you let J.R.
Take the babies in?I told Rollins

and we're shy?You ready to unload that piano?We're not selling Daddy's piano.And I'm not the one in Bardstown
drinking every Saturday.Am I a soldier of the crossA follower of the LambAnd shall I fear to own His causeEh, what's up, doc?Whoa.Hey, what did that...? That rooster
say when he was all blown up......by TNT and picking his feathers up
outside that henhouse?"Fortunately, boy, I keep my feathers
numbered for just such an emergency."I got it. I got it.Can we go soon?Mr. Coles gave me a dollar
to cut the whole pile and not half.Go on ahead, J.R. Catch a fish.Put a worm on a hookAnd drop it in a brookIf things go rightYou'll fry some fish tonightWhere you been? Where you been?Throw that pole down. Get in the car.
In the car.You hear them, J. R?Do you hear them angels?I can hear them, Jack.They're so beautiful.They're beautiful.Jack?Do something.Do something.You know what that is, J. R?- You know what that is...?
- Stop it, Ray.Nothing.Nothing. That's what that is.That's what that's worth.And that's what you are.Leave him alone, Ray. He didn't do this.The devil did this.
He took the wrong son.Stop it, Ray.
He was my best. Now he's gone.Jack, please don't leave me alone.Ray.
Quiet!Stop it...
Quiet! Everybody, quiet!You're gonna miss your bus.How come they put "John"
on there, J. R?Your name's J.R., not John.Letters don't cut it in the Air Force,
Reba. They told me to pick a name.Communist troops
have been driven out of Seoul...... by U.S. Forces,
led by General Douglas MacArth...Oh. What's that?- Anybody seen Tommy? Hey.
- He's leaving, Ray. Come on.Now, don't start crying, Mama.- Be careful with that rifle, J.R.
- Yeah, I will, Mama.Last month that Purvis boy
got confused and shot himself.Ain't gonna be no battles, Carrie.He's going to Germany.
The war is in Korea.I love you.
- Love you too.Take this.Thanks, Mama.Take care of yourself, Donzil.
Take care of my sister too.I will.Hey, Tommy? Be a good boy.- You're gonna miss your bus.
- Yeah.Excuse me. May I?"Dear Vivian, I really miss you.Boo hoo hoo."It don't matter what you write, Cash.No chassis like that's gonna stay parked
in her daddy's driveway for two years.Cash.Write something.I saw this church in DÃ¼sseldorf
made of limestone.Big as a train station.We can get married there
and go to Venice.That's in Italy, Viv. The streets
are made of water. I ain't kidding.Johnny...I haven't seen you for two years.We only dated for a month.My daddy says there's
something wrong with you.Well, what do you say, Viv?I mean, I thought you said
you loved me.I do. Oh, I do. I...Well, then don't be scared.
You tell him that.- You tell him I love you too.
- He says that's impossible.- He says that you hardly know me.
- I think I know perfect when I meet it.Let's go, Cash.Viv...Listen, baby. You tell your daddy
I'm your man.Tell him we'll make a family, and I'm
gonna be on the radio because I am.You tell him we'll have a nice house,
and we'll be happy.We'll live in Memphis.
Tell him I'll love you forever.- You promise?
- That's a promise, Viv. You hear me...?Five minutes was up
five minutes ago.I am Folsom Prison.At one time they called me
Bloody Folsom.And I earned the name.
My own prisoners built me.Every block of my granite
is cemented by the blood of men.Is it any wonder a man
sometimes went berserk...... and fought the hated walls
that shut him in?Knock it off, you.
Let a guy get some sleep.This was a common scene
in those old days.I had so little work for them to do.I hear the train comin'Comin' down the lineI can't see no sunshineFrom this window of mineI'm stuck.When I was just a baby
My momma said to me, "Son""Always be a good boy""Don't you mess around with guns"But I killed a man in RenoJust to watch him dieWhen I hear that whistle blowin'I hang my head...- and cryYou gonna try today, John?Really try to sell something?- What does that mean?
- I cleaned out your case last night.Baby, all I found were peanut bags
and music magazines.I need you to think
about what my daddy offered.Viv, I'm trying. I mean,
I'm really trying to sell stuff.Hello, ma'am. I'm from Home Equipment
Company over on Summer......and we have a lot of products...Enamel colors that you can choose from,
uh, that we can...Hello, I'm John Cash, and I'm from the
Home Equipment Company on Summer.Lucretia. Lucretia, who is it?Hey, you are late.Well, I woke up this morning
Looked out the doorI can tell that old milk cow
By the way she lowedWell, if you've seen my milk cow
Please ride her on homeI ain't had no milk and butter
Since that cow's been goneI've tried to treat you right
Day by dayGet out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and prayYou're gonna needYou're gonna need your lovin'
Daddy's help somedayWell, then you're gonna be sorry
For treating me this wayOh, come now!A little higher.You're close. Little higher.A little... Yeah, a little higher.Now play the chord.That's good.Let's hear your E, Marshall.There's my E.Loulabelle, time to come in.Jack. Jack, get in here.- Let's go.
Jack.Let's go, John.There are some peopleSay you cannot tellWhether you are saved or
Whether all is wellThey say you only can hope andTrust that it is soWell, I was there when it happenedAnd so I guess I ought to knowYes, I know when Jesus saved me- Saved my soul
- The very moment He forgave meMade me wholeHe took away my heavy burdensLord, He gave me peace within- Peace within
- Well, Satan can't make me doubt itI won't doubt itI'm gonna shout it...Viv?Viv, open the door.Viv.Viv, don't embarrass me.
Everyone's out there watching.I wanna see my daddy.I wanna go home, John. Please.He's just got a job sitting in there,
in San Antonio waiting for us.- It's just sitting there, waiting.
- Viv. The guys are here.My band is here in Memphis.Your band? John, your band?Your band is two mechanics
who can't hardly play.Oh, baby, can't you hear the difference
between you and that?You have your wife and your baby
in a dump, John......and another one on the way.
And we can't even make rent.John...Soon your sugar-daddies will all be goneYou'll wake up some cold day
And find you're aloneYou'll call for me
But I'm gonna tell you, "Bye, bye, bye"When I turn around and walk away
You'll cry, cry, cryYou're gonna cry, cry, cryAnd you'll cry aloneWhen everyone's forgotten
And you're left on your ownYou're gonna cry, cry, cryHey.- You hate me?
- No, I don't.That's a mean song.Stupid is what it is, Viv.Yeah.Vi... Viv, it's just a song.Excuse me, sir?
You the owner of this place?- That's me.
- Hello. I'm J.R. Cash.Sam Phillips.Good to meet you, Mr. Phillips.
I'm a singer, and I got a band.We've been working on some songs.You wanna cut a record, son,
it's $4.Well, what about the guys there
on the wall in the pictures?- I mean, they pay $4?
- They're on my label.Well, how do I get on there?- You audition.
- Right now?No...Call my secretary, Marion,
when she comes back.She's at the salon. She'll get you
an appointment next month.- I can't wait that long, Mr. Phillips.
- Excuse me?I can't wait that long.- What about this one? I can iron it.
- No.John, you can't wear that one.
It's black.It's the only color of shirt we all have.
Nothing wrong with black.- It looks like you're going to a funeral.
- Well, maybe I am.Yes, I know when Jesus saved me
Saved my soulThe very moment He forgave me
- Made me wholeHe took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within- Peace within
- Well, Satan can't make me doubt itI won't doubt it
- It's real and I'm gonna shout itI'm gonna shout itHold on. Hold on.I hate to interrupt,
but you guys got something else?I'm sorry. I can't market gospel
no more.So that's it?I don't record material
that doesn't sell, Mr. Cash.And gospel like that doesn't sell.So is it the gospel
or the way I sing it?Both.Well, what's wrong
with the way I sing it?I don't believe you.- You saying I don't believe in God?
J.R., come on. Let's go.No. I wanna understand.
I mean, we come down here......we play, and he tells me
I don't believe in God.You know exactly what I'm telling you.
We've already heard that song.A hundred times. Just like that.
Just like how you singing it.- Well, you didn't let us bring it home.
- Bring it...Bring it home?
All right, let's bring it home.If you was hit by a truck, and you
was lying out in that gutter dying......and you had time to sing
one song, huh?One song people would remember
before you're dirt......one song that would let God know
what you felt about your time......here on Earth, one song
that would sum you up......you telling me
that's the song you'd sing?That same Jimmie Davis tune
we hear on the radio all day?About your peace within
and how it's real......and how you're gonna shout it?Or would you sing
something different?Something real? Something you felt?I'm telling you right now,
that's the kind of song......people want to hear.
That's the kind of song......that truly saves people.It ain't got nothing to do
with believing in God, Mr. Cash.It has to do with believing in yourself.Well, I got a couple songs
I wrote in the Air Force.You got anything
against the Air Force?No.I do.J.R., whatever you're about
to play, we ain't never heard it.I hear the train a-comin'It's rollin' around the bendAnd I ain't seen the sunshineSince I don't know whenI'm stuck in Folsom PrisonAnd time keeps draggin' onBut that train keeps a-rollin'On down to San AntoneWhen I was just a babyMy momma told me, "Son""Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns"But I shot a man in RenoJust to watch him dieWhen I hear that whistle blowin'I hang my head and cryI bet there's rich folks eatin'
In a fancy dining carThey're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigarsWell, I know I had it comin'I know I can't be freeBut those people keep a-movin'And that's what tortures meWhere you been?Are you drunk?- What happened?
- He didn't like our gospel.So I played him some songs
that I wrote.And we made a record, Viv.I mean a real, real record.We did it like six times. I had to sing
the song over and over again.And I'm playing it, and you should've
seen Marshall, he was so nervous.But, I mean, we made
a real record of my song.- Oh, gee.
- I can't believe it. It's still...Yes, sirree, you're listening
to the Tennessee Farm Hour.Now, here's a new one
from our girl Patsy.Good lyrics.Did you write it?Yeah, it won a poetry prize
in Stars and Stripes.That was before...
That was before I set it to music.Hey, flip that over for me, will you?This is Bob Neal, and you're listening
to the Tennessee Farm Hour......brought to you
by Bronson Seed and Feed.Mr. Phillips? Oh, man, I broke it.
I broke it, I broke it.John. John. Broke what?
- The record, man, it's smashed.Mr. Neal, he asked me to flip it over......and when I went to do it,
it slipped out of my hands and it broke.The worst part is, I think he liked it.John, I know.
We can do it right now.- Let's get Luther and Marshall.
- We don't need to record it. Sit down.- I wanna record it.
- John.Sit down, John.
You don't have to record another one.What you broke is the test press.The factory sends me one of those
before they do a run of a thousand.He's yanking your chain, Mr. Phillips.Ain't no way nobody
could be that dumb.Leave him be, Jerry Lee.John?
Hmm?When are we gonna talk about......how this tour is gonna work?Because you're......out of town three out of four weeks
for the next three months.Well...You wanted it.
- Viv, I don't believe it.He's playing it again.Them folks at Sun tell me...... this boy starts a
four-state tour next week.Ho-ho! Son of a gun!We got a baby sleeping. Come on.Vivian, you hear that?Hey! Hey, that's my song!Oh, the baby.Hear Daddy in the wind?Cry, cry, cryI think she really likes it.My name is Jerry Lee Lewis

From getting the bluesHe grinned as he raised his little headHe popped a shoeshine rag
And then he said"Get rhythm when you get the bluesCome on, get rhythm

Makes you feel so fineIt'll shake all the trouble
From your worried mindGet rhythm when you get the blues"All right.Well, I sat down to listen
To the shoeshine boyAnd I thought I was gonna jump for joySlapped on the shoe polish
Left and rightHe took a shoeshine rag
And he held it tightHe stopped once
To wipe the sweat awayI said, "You're a mighty little boy
To be a-workin' thataway"He said, "I like it"
With a big, wide grinKept on a-poppin' and he said again"Get rhythm when you get the bluesCome on and get rhythmAll right!When you get the bluesIt only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoeIt does a million dollars' worth

I've ever seen, no kidding.Where are you?
- Texarkana. Baby, I miss you.Hey, do you hear Orbison doing our

- Damn it.What's the matter?Damn it. Roseanne just ran
her head into the table.Roseanne.
Roseanne. Here, talk to Daddy.Hey, Roseanne? Hey, it's Daddy.Honey, don't, don't cry.

- Good. Heck, I'm great, ma'am.- Hello, John, I'm Ezra.
- Yeah, I know.- It was nice to meet you, son.
- Real good to meet you, sir.I walked into a honky-tonky
Just the other dayI dropped a nickel in a jukebox
Just to hear it playI didn't have no tune in mind
I didn't wait to chooseJust dropped a nickel in the slot
And played the Jukebox BluesThere's a guy in there
With an old tin hornAnd a feller on an old banjoAnd the man on the fiddle
He wasn't no slouchHe could really drag that bowYou sounded good tonight, Cash.
Real tight.Oh, thanks, man.You want some chili fries?Oh, no, that's okay.She's been in the spotlight since
you and me was biting ankles.They say Maybelle
had a crib at the Ryman......so she could pull her out
and let her whoop and holler......and pop her back in
and go to sleep.It must have been a drumIt gave that song a solid beat
Boy, he was goin' someI walked into a honky-tonky
Just the other dayI dropped a nickel in a jukebox
Just to hear it playI didn't have no tune in mind
I didn't wait to chooseJust dropped a nickel in the slot
And played the Jukebox BluesI've played a lot of jukeboxes
Most every one in townBut that's the first tune I ever heard
That could make one dance aroundPlay the Jukebox BluesSuch a rhythm I never heard
I danced out both of my shoes- We're leaving in an hour, John.
All right.Oh, that's a sweet story, honey.All right.No.I'm leaving in, like, five minutes.All right.Is everything else all right?I love you too.- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
How you doing?- Coffee?
- Yeah......and some toast, please.- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?Good. Do you mind?No, not at all.- Did you lose your voice?
- I did.I was just singing my heart out
up there.I got to ask you how you came up
with that sound.What sound?That sound everybody's talking about.
Steady like a train. Sharp like a razor.Well, we'd play faster if we could.You know, I guess
it just come out like that.I gotta close my register.
- Oh, yeah, sure.Thank you.Here's a picture of my wife, Viv.- My baby, Roseanne.
- Oh, look at her. She's beautiful.Thanks. Got another one on the way.- I got a little girl too.
- Yeah?Her name's Carlene. Yeah.
She's about the same age.When I was in the service,
I used to look at pictures of you.- You know, in magazines.
- Oh.No. No, it wasn't like that.I mean, I...
I liked your music, you know?- Yeah?
- Yeah.I mean, I... You were... Well, you are...
I mean, I... I kept track of you.Yeah, you and your family, you know.I listened to your voice my whole life,
you know?Now, me and my brother, Jack,
we always listened to your songs.- You know, like "Swallerin' Place."
- Yeah.Yeah, we liked it
when you'd sing one alone.Well, you and Jack are the only ones.- What do you mean?
- I'm not really much of a singer, John.I mean, I got a lot of personality,
I got sass.I give it my all, but my sister Anita's
really the one who's got the pipes.- Well, who said that?
- Everybody.My mama, my daddy.That's how come I learned to be funny.
So I'd have something to offer.Well...Parents aren't always
the best judge of things......you want my opinion.So how long you on the tour?Another couple of weeks.
We just got on board......but I tell you,
it feels like a lot longer.I'm sure.I'm headed off.
I'm going to the Ryman.Tell your brother Jack to tune in,
I'll sing him something.What does he like?Oh, that's... That's sweet.
But he passed.I'm sorry. Were y'all real close?Yeah. Yeah, he's, uh...It's funny, I ain't talked about Jack
in a long time, you know? It's...After he died, I...
I talked about him all the time......but I guess people grew tired of it.So I just stopped.John?You're tired, aren't you?Yeah.It'll slow down.It will.I better get going.It was good to talk to you.- You too.
- Take care.Hopefully, I'll see you soon.
- You better tune in.- I'll sing you that "Swallerin' Place."
- I will. I really will.Okay.That's fine. That's... That's perfect.Yes, ma'am.When was the last time you heard him
moving around in there?I don't know.Thought you were gonna
help me today, John.You head out tomorrow.- Yeah.
- Yeah.Better start living life here with us
when you come home......before you have to leave again.You know, I was thinking.You know, maybe I could get Bob
to push my dates.I'm happy when I'm here.I like waking up and seeing your face.John, those bags over there...Those letters in there
are 10-to-one from girls.Ten to one. And they're obscene.Reba's been trying to answer
some of them.Half of them ain't even 15......and they are sending pictures
of themselves in bathing suits.Pictures for you to look at
while you're doing time at Folsom.- Oh, Viv.
- This one girl, she sent you her diar...Viv, don't even read
those letters, they're...It's just crazy right now, that's all.You know.Hell, you should have seen last week.We was at the fair......and this bus full of 4-H girls
pulls up, you know......and they come piling out of there.They go running, screaming
after Carl and Roy. I mean, running.John. I have a casserole in the oven
and your sister......in the kitchen, and I don't want
to talk about the tour.Well, Viv, you, you're the one
that brought it up.In fact, that's my new rule.When you come home......I wanna get right down
to talking about regular things.Viv, don't give me no rules.All I got are rules.All I got is to be
at this place at this time.I'm trying to go there......and I'm trying to spend time
with you, the kids.And write songs through this.
What do you want from me?I got you your dream house. All of your
things, all the pretty little things.I got you your car.
What do you want from me?I want you, John. I want you. And I
want everything that you promised me.Well, what if I can't do that?Got your mind on something?What are you doing up there, man?I'm building a bomb.Where are we going again?Tyler. George Jones' show.Where was it we just was?- Have another one, Carl.
Austin, Carl.That's where y'all picked me up.Hey, John,
you seen the new charts?"Cry, Cry, Cry" was 14, I think.Yeah, I heard that,
but I haven't seen it.Wherever we've been, I can tell you
where we're going.Everybody in this car's going to hell.And what about the car up there?We're all going to hell
for the songs we sing.People who listen to them
will go to hell too.You shut up with that.God gave us a great big apple, see?And he said, "Don't touch it."He didn't say touch it once in a while
or take a nibble when you're hungry.He said, "Don't touch it."Don't think about touching it.Don't sing about touching it.Don't think about
singing about touching it.And what about me, Jerry Lee?
Am I going to hell?No, June. You're beautiful.Sleepy is what I am.She's making me fall in love with her.Feel my heart. Come here. Sincerely.Feel my heart, baby.
It's just a-beating for you.- Stop.
Come on, feel it.- I'm falling for you.
Hey.- No, you're not. Jerry Lee.
Jerry Lee.Come on.Sit your ass down. Just sit down.The 1957 Chevrolet.
There's new designs...Looks like we're here.Oh, thank goodness.Get me out of this car
and all these boys.Let's go. Home sweet home, boys.You can just put those
right there. That'd be great.Oh, wait. I wanted
to give you that Billboard.Oh, right.It's in here somewhere.You got a library in there, June.Here it is. I circled it for you.
It's right there.Yeah, 14.I can't believe it.Um, I wanted to give you this.I just finished it. It's really amazing.- "The Prophet"?
- Yeah.Keep it.- Oh, no. You don't...
- Whenever I finish a book......I give it away to somebody.
It just lightens my load.John.I just went through a terrible divorce.And I got a world of judgment
on me right now.And, um, it's really
none of my business......but you seem like you have
a nice family.I'm sorry. It just happened.Just happened?Yeah.And you wear black because you can't
find anything else to wear?You found your sound
because you can't play no better?And you just tried
to kiss me......because it just happened?You should try taking credit
for something every once in a while.John.- Hey, Luth.
- Hey, John.You okay?I'll let you know in a few minutes.
How you doing?Okay. That boy Elvis
sure likes to talk poon.That's all I heard since Lubbock.- You want some?
- What is it?They'll make you wanna drive
all the way to Jacksonville......and enjoy yourself
once you get there.Elvis takes them.Yeah.Yes, sir.
Try some.That's a lot. Be careful.Here comes Marshall with his bomb.You got your lighter, J. R?
- Yeah.All right, you help me
get up in there. Grab that fuse.How long we got us after we light it?About 30 seconds a foot.All right.He light it?
Does your wife know......you like to blow stuff up?Sure she does. That's why
I married her, John.Well, you light it?There's a bomb up there...It'll go.It didn't work.Way to go, Johnny boy.It was around about four

spot for about 10 minutes......staring at that Polly Pepper book.Well, I can't... I can't figure which
one Roseanne would like more.She got brown hair,
which makes me think this one.- Right.
- But this is "Baby Sisters."And she got a baby sister, and...Well, I got that one for Carlene,
and she liked it.- Mm-hm. I missed her birthday.
- Oh.So I wanted
to get her something more......you know? Like one
of these dollhouses.But I don't know how
to get it out to her.Want me to help you?I think there's a lake right

fancy reels before.Well, what'd you use, a sapling?Yeah.Okay, hold on. I'll help you.It's like there's some kind
of lock on it or...No. My daddy taught me
how to do this, I'll show you.Keep your thumb there
on the button.That loosens the line.And then you're gonna bring it back.Then you're gonna throw it out there.And then when you're ready,
if you got a good spot for it......you let go of the button. All right?- Sidearm?
- Yeah, sidearm.All right.See? There you go.Just around the corner

And promised to loveAnd to cherish me over
All others aboveHow my heart is now wondering

- Where's my friend John?What'd he get, high? Or is he incognito?
Is he gone?Because I don't like this guy Cash.I ain't incognito.I'm right here. You see?- I'm here.
- Fine. Where's your car?It's in make up.- You walked here?
- Yeah.You walked here all the
way from Nashville?Yeah, well, walking's good for you.
See, I'm trying to get in shape, June.It cleans out your system.
Well, it's a spiritual thing.I'm on a love walk.- The June Carter love walk. Immemorial.
- You know what?I am supporting more than
myself right now.Please do not blow another tour.Oh, June, love's more
important than a tour.- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.Well, then start loving yourself.
So we can go back to work.All right, June.Hey, you keep your phone on,
and I will too.I'll call.I'll call you.When you're feeling better, I'll call.Oh. Oh, come on.Listen, you know,
times like this, I say to myself......I say, "Jack, what would
the baby Jesus do?"- That's your name? Jack?
- Mm-hm. Jack.Shit, I need another drink.Ahh. I am lit up of the spirit.
Yes, sir, Jack needs another drink.June Carter, June Carter
Would you give me some time?How much longer will it be till
Till I can call you mine?When you see Johnny, would you tell him
That you're gonna stick around?And then Johnny will buy youA nice white gownHey, that's a beautiful house.Hey, man.Beautiful place, man.- Yeah? Thanks.
- Uh-huh.Hello?
- June?- Hey, it's John.
- Hi.Hey. How you doing?I'm fine, John. How are you?Uh, doing a lot better than
last time you saw me.Well, that's good.
I'm glad to hear that.- You still taking those pills?
- No.That was, you know... That was
a rough patch there, June.I just needed to,
you know, get some time.I'm doing better,
though, now, you know?I got out of that apartment......and got this place out
in Hendersonville on a lake. Big spread.- I heard that.
- Yeah, I'm......trying to get things together.
- Uh-huh.Are you alone on Thanksgiving, John?Yeah... My folks are coming
down with Reba and Roseanne......and I got this big bird, but I don't
know when to put it in the oven......or really what
temperature to set it at or...Uh-huh.It is beautiful.
Really lucky.I'm really proud of you.
- You see? It goes from right up there......clear across halfway around the lake.
- Yeah.What's going on down
there with that tractor?Uh, I got it stuck. I was trying to pull
this stump, and I come up...Doing something dangerous.
- Yeah, but...That's a fine piece of equipment to
leave in that mud.Is that the way you take care
of your things?Hey.Thanksgiving, okay?Look at this.
Hey.Hey.
Happy Thanksgiving.Here, Carlene.- Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey, John.Hi.
- I like this place here.Oh, thanks. Hey, Rosie.
Happy Thanksgiving.Thank you.
- Hey.Let's go and meet John's...
- House is beautiful.Thanks. Thanks for coming.- John, how you doing?
Let me help you.- That's my mama, Carrie.
- Maybelle Carter, Happy Thanksgiving.- This is my daddy, Ray.
- How you doing?- Good to meet you.
- My mama, Carrie.- How do you do?
- Carrie was gonna cook for y'all......but J.R., he doesn't have
a pot or a pan, so...We're happy to share our food.I just moved in, you know.Thanks.
- Come inside.If you gonna get out on big
water like lakes or a river......you're gonna need something
you can cast out pretty good.If you haven't got one,
I'm gonna tell you......you need to get you a Zebco 33.That's about the best
reels you can get.Don't tangle up much, and you can cast
them about as far as you want.There in them little farm ponds, you
don't need nothing but a cane pole......and a float and maybe some crickets
or worms, if you can dig them up.That's all we ever had.The Zebco 33 is probably your best bet.
I bought June one when she was 12.- Remember that?
- That's right. I caught a lot of fish.You sure did.So, what do you think, Daddy?About what?About the house.It's a fine big house, John.- Thanks.
- It's not as big as Jack Benny's.What, you been to Jack Benny's, Ray?Saw it on the TV.Carrie, I was meaning to ask you,
did you teach the boys to play?Well, J.R. Always sang pretty, but I
don't think I could take credit for it.I'll bet you did. I bet you
learned the same way I did.Oh, out of the hymnals, sure.
I knew you'd say that.You know, you'd be surprised how many
musicians can't read shape notes.I can't imagine.
I know.But my husband's uncle, E.M. Bayes,
he taught me with hymnals too.Well, how about you, John?
You know how to read shape notes?John.Mama asked you a question, John.I'm really glad y'all
could be here today.Especially you, Daddy.Glad he came......to dinner,
and Thanksgiving, and all.Not everybody's here.Jack's not here, is he?Huh?"Where you been?"That's what you said to me.
Remember?And I was 12 years old......youse got Jack's bloody clothes......and you says to me,
"Where you been?"Well......where were you?Where were you?I quit drinking a long time ago, J.R.What about you?
You still taking them pills?- That'll kill you, you know.
- Yeah, well, so will a car wreck.You're sitting on a high horse, boy.I never had talent. I did the
best I could with what I had.Can you say that?Mister Big Shot?
Mister Pill-Popping Rock Star?- Ray.
Who are you to judge?You ain't got nothing.
Big empty house. Nothing.Children you don't see. Nothing.Big old expensive tractor
stuck in the mud.Nothing.Come on.Let's do it. Come on.You is a son of a bitch, ain't you?
Come on.Do it, do it.Come on.Come on.I'm gonna sit in the middle this time.Come on, you son of a bitch.- John?
A fine piece of equipment, huh?- John.
Come on.You should go down to him.
Mama.- He's mixed up.
- I am not going down there.- If I go down there...
- You already are down there, honey.Let's do it. Let's do it.John.John.John.John. John.- John.
- Aah!John. John.- June?
Come on.You should have left me.John?Go on ahead, J.R.You know what that is?Just please get away from me.Daddy?John?Hey, John?Oh, shit. Jesus. Hey...
What...? Hey, John?Get your ass out of here, boy.
- Hey, John.Get out.
Take your poison with you.Okay. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.Hey.Mom and I picked
these up down the road.They're good.It's good to see you again.Can I get you something else?Just stay.Okay.You're an angel.No, I'm not.You've been here with me.I had a friend who needed help.You're my friend.But I done so many bad things.You done a few. That's true.My daddy's right.Should have been me on that saw.Jack was so good.He would have done
so many good things.What have I done?Just hurt everybody I know.I know I've hurt you.I'm nothing.You're not nothing.You are not nothing.You're a good man.And God has given you a second
chance to make things right, John.This is your chance, honey.This is your chance.Hi, how are y'all?Could you...?It's okay. Come on.- The evidence of things not seen.By faith, Abel offered God a better gift......than his brother, Cain.
Better by faith.Cain left God. Cain fell from faith.He went out from the Lord
and he dwelt in the land of Nod......on the east of Eden.Amen.Let's all rise.What about the Tropicana?
What's wrong with the Opry?He was banned after he
smashed up the footlights.Well, if he smashes lights at Folsom,
they're gonna keep him there.Look, Frank, while Johnny was
out recuperating, the world changed.Dylan's gone electric.The Byrds are electric, the Beatles are
electric. Hell, everybody's electric.He needs a fresh sound,
and all he wants to do......is cut a live album with
the same old pickers......at a maximum security penitentiary.You can talk to me, you know.
I'm standing right here.And what's with the black?
It's depressing.Looks like you're going to a funeral.Maybe I am.Your fans are church folk, Johnny.Christians.They don't wanna
hear you singing......to a bunch of murderers and rapists,
trying to cheer them up.Well, they're not Christians then.I'm fine with you doing a live record.Just not at a prison.
That's my compromise.January 13th......l'll be at Folsom Prison
with June and the boys.You listen to the tapes.If you don't like them, toss them.Mr. Cash?M... Mr. Cash?Mr. Cash?Might I suggest you refrain from
playing any more tunes......that remind them, the inmates, that is,
that, well... That they're in prison.You think they forgot?Perhaps you and your wife
could do another spiritual.That's not my wife, warden.I keep asking her,
and she keeps saying no.You ever drink this water, warden?No. No, I'm a Coca-Cola man.All right.I wanna remind you we're
recording live here today......so you can't say hell or shit
or anything like that.I gotta tell you, I can't tell you
how many shows we've done......but this is the best
audience we ever had.I wanna thank you for that.You know, standing back there in
your shop, catching my breath......I come to admire you even more.You see, I never had to
do hard time like you.Although I have, on occasion......got myself busted.Once in El Paso I had this bag of...
Oh, you heard about that?You been in El Paso too?Well, anyways I felt tough,
you know?Like I'd seen a thing or two,
you know?Well, that was till a moment ago.Because I gotta tell you,
my hat's off to you now.Because I ain't never had to drink this
yellow water you got here at Folsom.This song is for your warden.Early one mornin'
While makin' the roundsI took a shot of cocaine
And I shot my woman downI went right home and I went to bedI stuck that lovin' forty-four
Beneath my headGot up next mornin'
And I grabbed that gunTook a shot of cocaine and away I runMade a good run but I run too slowThey overtook me
Down in JuÃ¡rez, MexicoLate in the hot joint takin' the pillsIn walked the sheriff from Jericho HillHe said, "Willy Lee, your name is not
Jack Brown""You're the dirty hack that
Shot your woman down"I was dressed in black.When I was arrested
I was dressed in blackThey put me on a train
And they took me backHad no friend for to go my bailThey slapped my dried-up carcass
In the county jailThe judge, he smiled
As he picked up his penNinety-nine years in the Folsom penNinety-nine years underneath that groundI can't forget the day
I shot that bad bitch downCome on, you gotta listen unto meLay off that whiskey
And let that cocaine beAll right!In the back.Hey, June.June.What's wrong, John?I don't know. Bad dreams. Memories.Well, you need to get
some rest, sweetie.You did good tonight.- But we got another show tomorrow.
- Yeah.Hey, listen.The thing is, I think it's time now.You know? I think it's about time.- Time for what?
- For you and me......to get married.Go to sleep, John.I don't wanna sleep.I wanna marry you,
and I'm telling you it's the time.Well, I am telling you with 100
percent certainty that it is not the time.It's not about time.It's not the right time.
It's not even a quarter to the right time.June.How do you know when...?You haven't been clean
even six months.Except for a honeymoon, you have not
thought about what you're asking me.Yes, I have.I have. It's all I've thought about.Well, how's it gonna work, John?Where we gonna live?What about my girls?What about your girls?
What about your parents, John?Your daddy won't even look at me.June, that stuff will
just work itself out.No, it doesn't work itself out.People work it out for you,
and you think it works itself out.- You're scared.
- What?Scared of being in love.Scared of losing control.
And you know what, June Carter?I think you're scared of living
in my big fat shadow.- That's your problem.
- Oh, really?- Is that my problem?
- Yeah, it is.My problem is it's 2 a.m.My problem is I'm asleep.I'm on a tour bus with
eight stinking men.Rule number one:
Don't propose to a girl on a bus.You got that? Rule number two:Don't tell her it's because
you had a bad dream.- June?
- What?Marry me.Okay.Well, that's... That's the last time
I'm asking.Well, good. I hate reruns.I got your extra bag.
You don't have to bother...Hey, June?June.June?What, you're not talking to me?You are not allowed to speak to me.
After that stunt......you're only allowed to
speak to me on-stage.- Do you understand?
- What'd I do?Why don't you ask
your big fat shadow?- Come on, baby.
- "Come on, baby."Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.The taste of love is sweetWhen hearts like ours meetI fell for you like a childOh, but the fire went wildI fell into a burning ring offireI went down, down, down
And the flames went higherAnd it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fireThe ring of fire
The ring of fireThe ring of fire
The ring of fireAll right. Thank you.I don't know if y'all know
who wrote that song......but it's this long-legged gal standing
right here, Miss June Carter.Thanks, y'all. Thank you very much.So, June, you gonna
stand over there all night......or you wanna come over
here and sing with me?I'll sing with you.
You sure that's what you want?- Yeah.
- All right. Hold on.- Well, folks, what do you say?
All right, Johnny.You wanna hear "Jackson"?I thought you was gonna wax
poetic a little bit longer.- Oh, no, I'm done with that, June.
- Okay, good.- We got married in a fever
- We got married in a fever- Hotter than a pepper sprout
- Hotter than a pepper sprout- We've been talking about Jackson

before we finish this song.What's that, John?Will you marry me?Why don't we just sing
the song, John.No, darling.Come on, finish the song.
People wanna hear us sing.Sorry, folks......but I just can't do this song anymore
unless she's gonna marry me.It'd just be like we're lying.You got these people
all revved up, John.- Now, come on, let's sing "Jackson."
- You got me all revved up.I've asked you 40 different ways, it's
time you come up with a fresh answer.Please sing.I'm asking you to marry me.I love you, June.Now, I know I've said and
done a lot of things......that I hurt you. But I promise
I'll never do that again.I only wanna take care of you.I will not leave you like that Dutch
boy with your finger in the dam.You're my best friend.Marry me.All right.Yeah?In case none of y'all heard,
she said yes.She finally said yes.Grandpa, here. Let's talk on this.- What do you want me to do with it?
- Well, you listen and you talk.It's a tin-can telephone,
and the sound goes up the string.Hello, grand girls.Hello, grand girls.Can you hear us?
- Hello, Roseanne.- Hello, Carlene.
- You gotta pull it tight, Daddy.Grandpa, speak.
Talk, Grandpa.- Tell us a story.
Speak. Grandpa.- Take it and talk to them.
- They wanna talk to their grandpa.Well, I don't got no stories.
You got all the stories. You...Why don't you tell
them about the flood?About how you made a boat out of the
front door and got us all out of there.They'll like that.Tell us.

Show her in, Mrs Pearce.You know, this is rather a bit of luck.
l'll show you how l make recordsWe'll set her talking and then l'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...then in broad Romic, and then
we'll get her on the phonograph...so you can turn her on when you want

as you would for French.So, l won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave itDo you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income ...it works out as fully equivalent of. ..60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.By George, it's enormous
lt's the biggest ofer l ever had .Sixty pound<i>s</i> What are you talkin' about
Where would l get 60 pound<i>s</i>l never ofered you 60 poundsBut l ain't got 60 poundsDon't cry, you silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.Sit down!Anybody'd think you was my father!lf l decide to teach you,

a pebble on the beach.Why notWhy not But you don't know
anything about her.What about her parents ?
She may be married.Garn!There. As the girl very properly says, garn!Who'd marry me ?By George, <i>E</i>liza ..the streets will be strewn

She'll have food and clothesShe'll only drink if you give her money.You are a brute ! lt's a lie!Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me .Sir, you're a gentleman.

No feelings we need worry aboutWell, have you, <i>E</i>lizal got me feelings same as anyone else .Mr. Higgins, l must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.What 's to become of her
when you've finished your teaching?You must look ahead a little, sir.What 's to become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs Pearce?That 's her own business ,
not yours, Mr. HigginsWhen l'm done we'll throw her back.Then it'll be her own business again.
That 'll be all right, won't itYou've no feelin' 'eart in yaYou don't care for nothin' but yourself.l've 'ad enough of this l'm goin', l am !You ought to be ashamed of yourselfHave some chocolates, <i>E</i>liza'Ow do l know what might be in 'eml've 'eard of girls bein' drugged

Mrs Pearce is quite rightlf this girl's going to put herself
in your hands for six months ..for an experiment in teaching, she mus

for the next six months ..learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.lf you're good and do what you're told,
you shall sleep in a proper bedroom. ..have lots to eat , money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxisBut if you are naughty and idle...you shall sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles ..and be walloped by Mrs Pearce
with a broomstick.At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.lf the King finds out
that you are not a lady...the police will take you to the Tower of
London where your head will be cut of ...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girlsBut if you are not found out
you shall have a present of. ..seven and six to start life with

You should at least answer itAll right, leave it on the des , Mrs Pearce.
l'll try an' get to itlf you please, sir. There's a dustma
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.Phew! l say!Well, send the blackguard up.He may not be a blackguard, HigginsOh, nonsense .
O' course he's a blackguard, Pickering.l'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.No, l think not Any trouble to be had ,
he'll have it with me . Not l with him.Doolittle, sir.-Professor 'lggin<i>s</i>
-Here!Where?Good morning, Governor.l come about a very serious matter,
Governor.Brought up in Houndslow.Mother Welsh , l should think.What is it you want , Doolittle?l want my daughter, that 's what l want .
See?Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?l'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left .She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.What ?Take her away . Do you think l am going
to keep your daughter for you?Now, is this reasonable, Governor?ls it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that ?The girl belongs to me . You got 'er.
Where do l come in?How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me !You sent her here on purpose !Don't take a man up like that , Governor.The police shall take you up.
This is a pla ..a plot to extort money by threatslshall telephone the police.Have l asked you for a brass farthin'?l leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have l said a word about money?Well, what else did you come for?What would a bloke come for?Be 'uman, Governor.Alfred, you sent her here on purpose .So help me , Governor, l never did.Then how did you know she was here?l'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd only let me get a word in.l'm willing to tell ya
l'm wanting to tell yal'm waiting to tell yaYou know, Pickering, this chap 's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.''l'm willing to tell you. l'm wanting
to tell you. l'm waiting to tell you.''That 's the Welsh strain in 'im.How did you know <i>E</i>liza was here
if you didn't send 'er?Well, she sent back for her luggage
and l got to 'ear about itShe said she didn't want no clothesWhat was l to think from that , Governor?
lask you, as a parent, what was l to think?So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?-Yes, sir, Governor. That 's right
-YesMrs Pearce!<i>E</i>liza' s father has come to take her away .
Give her to him will you?Now wait a minute , Governor.
Wait a minute .You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs Pearce.lthink so indeed, sir!Here, Governor.l've took a sort of a fancy to you and ...if you want the girl, l ain't so set
on 'avin' her back home again...but what l might be open to
is an arrangementAll l ask is my rights as a father.You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.l can see you're o' the straight sort,
Governor.So...what 's a five pound note to you?
An' what 's <i>E</i>liza to me ?lthink you ought to know, Doolittle...that Mr. Higgins' intentions are
entirely honorable.Of course they are, Governor.
lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.Do you mean to say you'd sell
your daughter for 50 pound<i>s</i>Have you no morals, man?No, l can' t afford 'em Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me .Not that l mean any 'arm mind ya, but ..if <i>E</i>liza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me , too?Why notWell, look....Look at it my way . What am l?lask ya, what am l? l'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that 's what l am .Now think what that means to a man.lt means he's up agains
middle-class morality for all the time .lf there's anything goin' an' l puts in
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:''You're undeservin', so you can' t have it ''But my needs is as great as the mos
deservin' widows that ever got money...out of six diferent charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband .l don't need less than a deservin' man,
l need more.l don't eat less 'earty than he does
and l drink...a lot more.l'm playin' straight with you.lain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, l'm undeservin'...And I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that 's the truth.But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?And I leave it to you.You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales- We'd better give 'im a fiver.
- He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won'tJust one good spree
for meself an' the missus...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to othersAn' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.You couldn't spend it better.Oh, this is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten, Governor.Ten pounds is a lot o' money.Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality, Doolittle.Why don't you marry
that missus of <i>yours</i>After all, marriage isn 't so frightening.
You married Eliza' s mother.Who told you that, Governor?Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally...If we listen to this man for another minute
we shall have no convictions left.- Five pounds, I think you said.
- Thank you, Governor.Are you sure you won't have ten?No. No, perhaps another time.I beg your pardon, Miss.I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.Blimey, it's ElizaWell, I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.She does me credit, don't she, Governor?Here! What are you doin' here?Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.That 's the way to improve 'er mind.Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, ElizaThere's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...a common dustman, one o'

I knew 'em before I come.If you know them say them.Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.A, <i>E,</i> I, O, U.That 's what I said. Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.That 's what I been sayin' for three days
an'I won't say 'em no more.I know it's dificult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.There's no use explaining.
As a military man you ought to know that.Drilling is what she needsLeave her alone or she'll be turning to you
for sympathy.Very well, if you insis

Ithink the time has come to try her outAre you feeling all right, Mr. <i>Higgins</i>Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?- Very well, thank you.
- Good.Let's test her in public
and see how she faresMr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.Do you know what it might have been?I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?If this goes on, Mrs Pearce,
you'd better see a doctor.- I know. We'll take her to the races
- The <i>races</i>My mother's box at Ascot- You'll consult your mother firs
- Yes, of course.No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.First thing in the morning,
we'll go out and buy her a dress.Now get on with your work, ElizaBut, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.What better time to work
than early in the morning?Where does one buy a lady's gown?Whitely's, of course.How do you know that?Common knowledge.Let's not buy her anything too flowery.I despise those gowns
with, sort of weeds here and weeds there.We'll buy something
sort of simple and modes...and elegant. That 's what 's called for.Perhaps with a bow.Yes That 's just rightYou've all been working much too hard.
Ithink the strain is beginning to show.<i>Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins saysYou must put down your books

Mother, I've got a job for you.A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.Oh, no, not a love affair.
She's a flower girl.I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out firs- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you know the Embassy Ball.So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?Common flower girl?Itaught her how to speak properly.She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.She's to keep to two subjects:
The weather and everybody's health."Fine day!" and "How do you do?"
Not just let herself go on things in general.Help her along, darling.
You'll be quite safe.Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?Well, she's got to talk about something.Where is the girl now?She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't quite fit.Itold Pickering we should have
taken her with us- Mrs Eynsford-Hill.
- Good afternoon, Mrs HigginsYou know my son, Henry.How do you do?- I've seen you somewhere before.
- I don't know.It doesn 't matter. You better sit down.Where the devil can they be?Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for teaThank you, Mrs Higgins
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?My dear, Miss Doolittle.How kind of you to let me come.Delighted, my dear.- Lady Boxington.
- How do you do?- Lord Boxington.
- How do you do?How do you do?- Mrs Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
- How do you do?How do you do?And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.How do you do?How do you do?Miss Doolittle.Good afternoon, Professor HigginsThe first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.I'm so sorry that you missed itWill it rain, do you think?The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.How awfully funny.What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it rightSmashing.Has it suddenly turned chilly?I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spellsThey bring on so much influenzaAnd the whole of our family
is susceptible to itMy aunt died of influenza, so they said.But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.Done her in?Yes, Lord love you.Why should she die of influenza...when she come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.Fairly blue with it she was.They all thought she was dead.But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl of the spoon.Dear me!Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...have to die of influenzaAnd what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?Somebody pinched itAnd what I say isThem 'as pinched it, done her in.Done her in? Done her in, did you say?Whatever does it meaOh, that 's the new small talk.
"To do somebody in" means to kill them.But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?Do I notThem she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.But it can' t have been right
for your father...to pour spirits down her throat like that.It might have killed her.Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of itDo you mean that he drank?Drank? My word. Something chronic.Here, what are you sniggering at?The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?Have I said anything I oughtn 'tNot at all, my dear.Well, that 's a mercy anyhow.I don't know if there's enough time
before the next race to place a bet...but come, my dear.I have a bet on number seven.
Ishould be so happy if you would take itYou'll enjoy the race ever so much more.That 's very kind of you.His name is Dover.Come along, Eliza<i>There they are again</i><i>Lining up to run</i><i>Now they're holding steady</i><i>They are ready for it, look</i><i>It has begun</i>Come on. Come on, Dover.Come on.Come on, Dover!Come on!Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' assOh, my dear.You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.Don't you think she's ready for itDear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.Her language may need
a little refining, but- -Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...then you must be
absolutely potty about her.Ladvise you to give it up

<i>They don't bother me</i><i>For there's nowhere else on Earth</i>
<i>That I would rather be</i><i>Let the time go by</i><i>I won't care if I<i>Can be here on the street</i>
<i>Where you live</i>It really is, Higgins
It's inhuman to continue.Do you realize what you've got to try
and teach this poor girl in six <i>weeks</i>You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call of the betI know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.This experiment is over.And nothing short of an order
from the King could force me to recant.You understand, <i>Higgins</i> It's over.Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...if Miss Doolittle sufers
any embarrassment whatever...it'll be on your head alone.<i>Eliza can do anything.Suppose she's discovered?
Remember AscotSuppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.Think of how agonizing it would be.If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.You could always rejoin your regimentThis is no time for flippancy, HigginsThe way you've driven her
the last six weeks...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.For God's sake, stop pacing up and down.
Can' t you settle somewhere?Have some port lt'll quieten your nervesI'm not nervous- Where is it
- On the piano.The car 's here, sir.Good. Tell Miss Doolittle, will you?Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn 't fit.I warned you
about these French designersWe should have gone to <i>an</i> English shop.
They would've been on our side.- Have a glass of port
- No, thank you.Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?Well, we shall see.Suppose she doesn 'tI lose my betThere's one thing I can' t stand about you,
that 's your confounded complacency.At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of portAnd what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn 't matter at all.Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she mattersWhat do you think I've been doing
all these <i>months</i>What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...and change her into a diferent human
being by creating a new speech for her?It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...and soul from soul.Oh, she matters immensely.Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.Thank you, Colonel Pickering.Don't you think so, <i>Higgins</i>Not bad. Not bad at all.Maestro! Maestro!Don't you remember me?No. Who the devil are you?I'm your pupil.
Your firs your greates your best pupil.I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.Imade your name famous
throughout Europe.You teach me phonetics
You cannot forget me.Why don't you have your hair cutI don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.Where did you get all of these old <i>coins</i>These are decorations for languagesThe Queen of Transylvania is here
this evening.I'm indispensable to her
at these oficial international partiesIspeak 32 languages
I know everyone in Europe.No imposter can escape my detection.Professor Karpathy.The Greek ambassador.Greek, my footHe pretends not to know any English,
but he cannot deceive me.He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...without betraying his origin.I help him pretend, but I make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.<i>Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs

- Good evening.What an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening.Well, who is she?Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins
<i>Excuse me.Professor HigginsSuch a faraway look,

some more about the Greek ambassador.Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.Does he really come from Yorkshire?<i>Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...</i><i>and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.</i>Charming. Quite charming.Miss Doolittle, Madam.Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.Absolutely fantastic.A lot of tomfoolery.It was an immense achievementWell, Mr. <i>Higgins</i>Atriumph, Mrs Pearce. A total triumph.Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?Not during the whole evening?Not when I saw we were going to win.Lfelt like a bear in a cage hanging aboutIt was an immense achievementIf I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given it up two months ago.Absolutely fantastic.Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.Higgins, I salute you.The silly people don't know
their own silly business.<i>Tonight, old man, you did it</i>
<i>You did it, you did it</i><i>You said that you would do it</i>
<i>And indeed you did</i><i>I thought that you would rue it</i>
<i>I doubted you'd do it</i><i>But now I must admit it</i>
<i>That succeed you did</i><i>You should get a medal</i>
<i>Or be even made a knight</i><i>Oh, it was nothing, really nothing</i><i>All alone you hurdled</i>

<i>The "oohs"and "aahs"</i><i>Everyone wondering who she was</i><i>You'd think they'd never seen</i>
<i>A lady before</i><i>And when the Prince of Transylvania</i>
<i>Asked to meet her</i><i>And gave his arm</i>

<i>You did it, you did it"</i><i>They thought she was ecstatic</i>
<i>And so damned aristocratic</i><i>And they never knew</i>
<i>That you</i><i>did it</i>Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom.Karpathy? That dreadful Hungaria
Was he there?Yes, he was there all right
and up to his old tricks<i>That blackguard</i>
<i>Who uses the science of speech</i><i>More to blackmail and swindle than teach</i><i>He made it the devilish business of his</i><i>To find out who this Miss Doolittle is</i><i>Every time we looked around</i>
<i>There he was</i><i>That hairy hound from Budapest</i><i>Never leaving us alone</i>
<i>Never have I ever known</i><i>A ruder pest</i><i>Finally I decided it was foolish</i>
<i>Not to let him have his chance with her</i><i>So I stepped aside</i>
<i>And let him dance with her</i><i>Oozing charm from every pore</i>
<i>He oiled his way around the floor</i><i>Every trick that he could play</i>
<i>He used to strip her mask away</i><i>And when at last the dance was done</i>
<i>He glowed as if he knew he'd won</i><i>And with a voice too eager</i>
<i>And a smile too broad</i><i>He announced to the hostess</i>
<i>That she was a fraud</i>No!<i>"Her English is too good,"he said</i>
<i>"That clearly indicates that she is foreign</i><i>"Whereas others are instructed</i>
<i>In their native language</i><i>"English people aren't</i><i>"And although she may have studied with</i>

without dreading tomorrow.- Good night, Mr. Higgins
- Good night, Mrs Pearce.Ithink I'll turn in, too. Good night, Higgins
It's been a great occasion.Good night, Pickering.Mrs Pearce?Damn, I meant to ask her to give me
cofee in the morning instead of teaLeave a little note for her will you, Eliza
And put out the lights.Must be downstairs Oh, darn itI'll leave my head behind
one of these daysWhat the devil have I done
with my <i>slippers</i>Here are your slippersTake your slippers and may you never
have a day 's luck with them.What on Earth? What 's the matter?Is anything wrong?No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?That 's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?You won my bet
You presumptuous insect I won itWhy did you throw those slippers at me?Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up, the gutter?You thank God it's all over. Now you ca
throw me back again! Do you?Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?Sit down and be quietOh, what 's to become of me?
What 's to become of me?How the devil do I know
what 's to become of you?What does it matter?You don't care. I know you don't care.You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.Not as much as them slippersThose slippersThose slippers I didn't think it meant
any diference now.Why have you suddenly begun
going on like <i>this</i>May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs Pearce?Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?Well, I'm glad to hear that.Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.Would you have a chocolate?No, thank you.Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.Nothing more to worry aboutNo, nothing more for you to worry aboutOh, God, I wish I was dead.Why? In heaven's name, why?Now listen to me, Eliza
All this irritation is purely subjective.I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.Go to bed and sleep it of.Have a little cry and say your prayers
You'll feel very much more comfortable.I heard your prayers"Thank God it's all over."Don't you thank God it's all over?Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?Where am I to go? What am I to do?And what 's to become of me?Oh, that 's what 's worrying you, is itI wouldn't worry about that if I were you.I'm sure you won't have any dificulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.I didn't quite realize you were going away.You might marry, you know.You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devilsYou're not bad -Iooking.You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimesNot now, when you've been crying.You look like the very devil, but...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.Go to bed, have a good night's res
get up in the morning...and have a look at yourself in the glass
You won't feel so bad.I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.We were above that in Covent Garden.What do you meaIsold flowers, I didn't sell myself.Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.Oh, tosh, Eliza
Don't insult human relations...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into itDon't marry the fellow
if you don't want to.What else am I to do?Oh, there are lots of thingsWhat about the old idea of a florist shop?I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.He'll pay for all those togs
you're wearing.And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 poundsOh, come on now. You'll be all rightWell, I must be of to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.I was looking for something. What was itYour slippersOh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.Before you go, sir.Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?Why bother about that
in the middle of the nightWhat may I take away with me?I don't want to be accused of stealing.Stealing?You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.I'm sorry. I'm only a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.There can' t be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn 'tTake the whole damned houseful
if you want.<i>Except the jewelry. That 's hired.
Will that satisfy you?Stop, please.Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?I don't want to run the ris
of them being missed.Oh, hand them over! If these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...I'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.The ring isn 't the jeweler's
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.I don't want it now.Don't you hit me!Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heartI'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.You've caused me to lose my temper.
That 's hardly happened to me before.I don't wish to discuss it further tonight
I'm going to bed.Leave your own note for Mrs Pearce
about the cofee...for it won't be done by me!Damn Mrs Pearce,
damn the cofee and damn you!Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!<i>Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins</i>
<i>Just you wait!</i><i>You'll be sorry</i>
<i>But your tears will be too late</i><i>You will be the one it's done to</i><i>And you'll have no one to run to</i><i>Just you wait</i><i>I have often walked</i>

Tell him what he's done to me.What 's he done to you?Ruined me, that 's all.Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.And don't you defend him.Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to a
old American blighter named Wallingford...who was giving five millions
to found Moral Reform societies...to tell him the most original moralis
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...a common dustmaSounds like one of his jokes.You may call it a j
It's put the lid on me. Proper.The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.Itouched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.Now I'm tied neck and 'eels

without telling me a thing about itWhat am I to do?
I got tea this morning instead of cofee.I don't know where anything is,
what my appointments are.- Eliza' d know.
- Damn it, she's gone!Did either of you gentlemen
frighten her last nightWe hardly said a word to her.
You were there.Did you bully her after I went to bed?She threw the slippers at me.I never gave her the slightest provocation.The slippers came bang at my head
before I uttered a word.She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand itWe always gave her every consideration.
She admitted itI'm dashed!Oh, Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!Phone the police.
What are they there for in heaven's name?You can' t give Eliza' s name to the police...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrellaBut why not I want to find the girl.She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.Quite right Hello. Scotland Yard, please?Get me some cofee, would you please?Scotland Yard?I beg your pardon, yes This is,
this is Colonel Pickering speaking.27 A Wimpole StreetI want to report a missing person.Miss Eliza Doolittle.About 21.Oh, I should say about 5 foot 7.Her <i>eyes</i> Let me think now.
Her eyes Her eyes- -- Brown.
- Brown.Her hair? Oh, good Lord.
Well, sort of nondescript neutral sort of- -Brown, brown, brown!You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yesNo, no, no. This is her residence. 27 A...Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00
this morning, I understand.No, no, no...
No, she's no relation, no.Well, just let's call her a good friend,
shall we?I beg your pardon?Listen to me, my man,
I don't like the tenor of that question.What the girl does here is our affair.Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing itWell, I'm dashed!<i>What in all, in heaven</i>
<i>Could have prompted her to go?</i><i>After such a triumph at the ball</i><i>What could have depressed her?</i><i>What could have possessed her?</i>

at this end. Could I come and see you?Well, I could, yes Now, straight away?Right Good. Thank you.Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.Mrs Pearce, I'm going along
to the Home Ofice.I do hope you find her,
Colonel Pickering.Mr. Higgins will miss her.Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!- Mrs Pearce?
- Yes, sir.Where's the Colonel?He's gone to the Home Ofice, sir.There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs
for help. Now there's a good fellow.Mrs Pearce, you're a woman.<i>Why can't a woman be more like a man?</i><i>Men are so decent</i>
<i>Such regular chaps</i><i>Ready to help you</i>
<i>Through any mishaps</i><i>Ready to buck you up</i>
<i>Whenever you are glum</i><i>Why can't a woman be a chum?</i><i>Why is thinking</i>
<i>Something women never do?</i><i>And why is logic never even tried?</i><i>Straightening up their hair</i>
<i>Is all they ever do</i><i>Why don't they straighten up</i>
<i>The mess that's inside?</i><i>Why can't a woman behave like a man?</i><i>If I was a woman</i>
<i>Who'd been to a ball</i><i>Been hailed as a princess</i>
<i>By one and by all</i><i>Would I start weeping</i>
<i>Like a bathtub overflowing?</i><i>Or carry on as if my home</i>
<i>Were in a tree?</i><i>Would I run off</i>
<i>And never tell me where I'm going?</i><i>Why can't a woman be like me?</i>You mean that after you'd done
this wonderful thing for them...without making a mistake...they just sat there
and never said a word?Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?Not a word.They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...and what a bore it had all been.This is simply appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.Ishould have thrown the fire ironsWho's that?Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.Now, remember...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.Mother, the most confounded thing...
Do you...You!Good afternoon, Professor Higgins
Are you quite well?Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some teaDon't you dare try that game on me.
Itaught it to you.Get up, come home and stop being a fool.You've caused me enough trouble.Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.How did this baggage get here?<i>Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.If you don't promise to behave yourself
lmust as you to leave.You mean, I'm to put on
my Sunday manners for this...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?That 's precisely what I meaHowever did you learn good manners
with my son around?It was very dificult I should never have
known how ladies...and gentlemen behave
if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.You see, Mrs Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...the diference between a lady
and a flower girl isn 't how she behaves...but how she is treated.Ishall always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.I know I'll always be a lady
to Colonel Pickering...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.Henry, don't grind your teeth.The bishop is here, Madam.
Shall I show him into the garden?The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!Ishould be excommunicated.I'll see him in the library.<i>Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...I give you full permission
to have him evicted.Henry dear, I suggest you stick to
two subjects: The weather and your health.You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.Have you had enough and are you going to
be reasonable or do you want any more?You want me back to pick up
your slippers...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.I didn't say I wanted you back at all.Indeed? Then what are we talking aboutWell, about you, not about me.If you come back you'll be treated
as you've always been.I can' t change my nature or my mannersMy manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering'sThat 's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.And I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.Oh, I see. The same to everybody.You see, the great secret
is not a question of good manners...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manners...but having the same manner
for all human soulsThe question is not
whether I treat you rudely...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.I don't care how you treat me.I don't mind your swearing at me.
Ishouldn't mind a black eye.I've had one before this
But I won't be passed over!Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.You talk about me as though
I was a motorbusSo you are a motorbus All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can' tI know you ca I told you, you could.You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...whether I could get along without you?Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.So I can, without you or any soul on Earth.Ishall miss you, Eliza I've learned
something from your idiotic notionsI confess that humbly and gratefully.Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.When you feel lonely without me you ca
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurtWell, I can' t turn your soul on.Oh, you are a devil!You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.What am I to come back for?For the fun of it That 's why I took you on.You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.Yes And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.And live with my father?Yes, or sell flowers
Would you rather marry Pickering?I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he isI'll talk as I like.
You're not my teacher now.That 's not what I want
and don't you think it isI've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that itNo, I don't That 's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.I want a little kindness.I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...but I'm not dirt under your feetWhat I done... what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to... came...to care for you.Not to want you to make love to me...and not forgetting the diference
between us, but...more friendly like.Well, of course. That 's how I feel.And how Pickering feels
<i>Eliza, you're a fool!That 's not the proper answer.It's the only answer
till you stop being a idiotIf you want to be a lady,
you must stop feeling neglected...if the men don't spend
half their time sniveling over you...and the other half giving you black eyesYou find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?Of with you to the sort of people you like.Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.If you can' t appreciate what you've got,
you'd better get what you can appreciate.I can' t talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.I'm always in the wrong.Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...to be trampled on and talked down.I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.That poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...even if he had the guts to try for itWoman, don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.I'll go and be a teacher.What 'll you teach, in heaven's name?What you taught me. I'll teach phoneticsI'll ofer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant HungariaWhat, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying <i>ignoramus</i>Teach him my methods, my <i>discoveries</i>You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.That 's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.Now, I don't care for your bullyin'
an'your big talk.<i>What a fool I was</i><i>What a dominated fool</i><i>To think you were the Earth and sky</i><i>What a fool I was</i><i>What an addle-pated fool</i><i>What a mutton-headed dolt was I<i>No, my reverberating friend</i><i>You are not the beginning and the end</i>You impudent hussy!There's not an idea in your head or a word
in your mouth that I haven't put there.<i>There'll be spring every year</i>
<i>Without you</i><i>England still will be here</i>
<i>Without you</i><i>There'll be fruit on the tree</i>
<i>And a shore by the sea</i><i>There'll be crumpets and tea</i>
<i>Without you</i><i>Art and music will thrive</i>
<i>Without you</i><i>Somehow Keats will survive</i>

<i>Without you</i><i>I can do</i><i>Without you</i><i>You, dear friend</i><i>Who talk so well</i><i>You can go to</i><i>Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire</i><i>They can still rule the land</i>

<i>So can I<i>I shall not feel alone</i>

<i>I knew it, I knew it</i><i>I said I'd make a woman</i>
<i>And succeed I did</i><i>Eliza, you're magnificentFive minutes ago you were
a millstone around my neck...and now you're a tower of strength.A consort battleship.I like you this way.Goodbye, Professor Higgins
You shall not be seeing me again.Mother!Mother!What is it, Henry? What 's happened?She's gone.Well, of course, dear.
What did you expectWhat am I to do?Do without, I suppose.And so I shall.If the Higgins' oxygen burns up
her little lungs...let her seek some stufiness
that suits her.She's an owl sickened
by a few days of my sunshine.Let her go. I can do without her.I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul!My own spark of divine fire!Bravo, Eliza<i>Damn, damn, damn, damn</i><i>I've grown accustomed to her face</i><i>She almost makes the day begin</i><i>I've grown accustomed to the tune</i>
<i>That she whistles night and noon</i><i>Her smiles, her frowns</i>

<i>Before we met</i><i>Surely I could always be that way again</i><i>And yet I've grown</i>
<i>Accustomed to her looks</i><i>Accustomed to her voice</i><i>Accustomed to her face</i>Marry Freddy.What an infantile idea What a heartless,

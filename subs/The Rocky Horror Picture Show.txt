-JanetNow I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, JanetI love youDamn it, JanetOh, Brad, I'm madDamn it, JanetI love youI would like, if I may. . .. . .to take you on a strange journey.It seemed a fairly ordinary night. . .. . .when Brad Majors and
his fiancée, Janet Weiss. . .. . .two young, ordinary,
healthy kids. . .. . .Ieft Denton that
late November evening. . .. . .to visit a Dr. Everett Scott. . .. . .ex-tutor and now friend
to both of them.It's true there were
dark storm clouds. . .. . .heavy, black and pendulous. . .. . .toward which they were driving.It's true also that the spare tire
they carried. . .. . .was badly in need of some air.But they, being normal kids and. . .. . .on a night out. . .. . .they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.On a night out.It was a night out. . .. . .they were going to remember. . .. . .for a very long time.I have never been a quitter.To leave office before my term
is completed is abhorrent...... to every instinct in my body.But as president......l must put the interests
ofAmerica first.America needs a full-time president......and a full-time Congress......particularly at this time....Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.They sure do take their lives
in their hands.Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap
to that type.What's the matter, Brad, darling?We took the wrong fork
a few miles back.Oh.Where did that motorcyclist come from?I guess we'll just have to turn back.What was that bang?We must have a blowout.Damn it! I knew I should've gotten
that spare tire fixed.You stay here and I'll go for help.We're in the middle of nowhere.Didn't we pass a castle
a few miles back?Maybe they have a telephone
I could use.I'm going too.-Both of us don't need to get wet.
-I'm coming with you.Besides, the owner of that phone
might be a beautiful woman. . .. . .and you might never
come back again.In the velvet darknessOf the blackest nightBurning brightThere's a guiding starNo matter whatOr...... who you areThere's a lightOver at the Frankenstein placeThere's a lightBurning in the fireplaceThere's a light, lightIn the darknessOf everybody's lifeThe darkness must goDown the riverOf nights dreamingFlow morphia slowLet the sunAnd light come streamingInto my lifeInto my lifeThere's a lightOver at the Frankenstein placeThere's a lightBurning in the fireplaceThere's a lightLightIn the darknessOf everybody's lifeAnd so. . .. . .it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet. . .. . .and they had found the assistance
that their plight required.Or had they?Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.Hello.Hi! My name's Brad Majors.This is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.Do you have a phone we might use?You're wet.Yes, it's raining.Yes.Oh.I think, perhaps,
you better both come inside.You're too kind.I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?It's probably some kind of
hunting lodge for rich weirdos.This way.Are you having a party?You've arrived on
a rather special night.-It's one of the master's affairs.
-Oh.-Lucky him.
-You're lucky.He's lucky, I'm lucky,
we're all lucky!It's astoundingTime is fleetingMadness takes its tollBut listen closelyNot for very much longerI've got to keep controlI rememberDoing the time warpDrinkingThose moments whenThe blackness would hit meAnd the void would be callingLet's do the time warp againLet's do the time warp againIt's just a jump to the left-And a step to the right

how to Madison?-Brad, please, let's get out of here.
-Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.-But it seems so unhealthy here.
-It's just a party, Janet.-Well, I want to go.
-We can't till I get to a phone.-Then ask the butler or someone.
-Just a moment.We don't want to interfere
with their celebrations.This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.They're probably foreigners
with different ways.They may do some more folk dancing.I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.I'm here, there's nothing
to worry about.How do you doI see you've metMy faithful handymanHe's just a little brought downBecause when you knockedHe thought you were the candymanDon 't get strung outBy the way I lookDon 'tjudge a book by its coverI'm not much of a manBy the light of dayBut by night I'm one hell of a loverI'm just a sweet transvestiteFrom Transsexual......

the aces when the time is right.Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.Hi. My name's Brad Majors and
this is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.You are. . .?You are very lucky to be invited
up to Frank's laboratory.Some people would give their
right arm for the privilege.People like you, maybe?I've seen it.Come along. The master doesn't
like to be kept waiting.Shift it!Is he--? Frank, I mean,
is he your husband?The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.-We are simply his servants.
-Oh.Magenta.Columbia.Go and assist Riff Raff.I will entertain. . . .Brad Majors and this is
my fiancée, Janet Vice.-Weiss.
-Weiss?Enchanté.Well, how nice.And what charming underclothes
you both have.But here, put these on.They'll make you feel less vulnerable.It's not often
we receive visitors here.Let alone offer them hospitality.Hospitality! All we wanted to do
was use your telephone. Goddamn it!A reasonable request you have ignored!-Don't be ungrateful.
-Ungrateful?!How forceful you are, Brad.Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.You must be awfully proud
of him, Janet.Well, yes, I am.-Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
-Certainly not.Oh, well. How about you?Everything is in readiness, master.We merely await your word.Tonight, my unconventional
conventionists. . .. . .you are to witness
a new breakthrough. . .. . .in biochemical research.And paradise is to be mine!It was strange the way it happened.Suddenly. . .. . .you get a break.All the pieces seem to fit into place.What a sucker you've been.
What a fool.The answer was there all the time.It took a small accident
to make it happen.-An accident!
-An accident!That's how I discovered the secret.That elusive ingredient.That spark. . .. . .that is the breath of life.Yes.I have that knowledge.I hold the secret. . .. . .to life itself!You see. . .. . .you are fortunate.For tonight is the night. . .. . .that my beautiful creature
is destined to be born.Throw open the switches
on the sonic oscillator.And step up the reactor power input. . .. . .three more points!Oh, Brad!It's all right, Janet.Oh, Rocky!The sword of Damocles

Gonna be cutting the threadOh, woe is meMy life is a miseryOh, can 't you seeThat I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downerI woke up this morning with a start
When I fell out of bedThat ain 't no crimeAnd left from my dreaming
Was a feeling of unnameable dreadThat ain 't no crimeMy high is lowI'm dressed up with no place to goAnd all I knowIs I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer-That ain 't no crime.
-Oh, no, no, no.-That ain 't no crime.

-Oh, no, no, no.That ain 't no crimeWell, really!That's no way to behave
on your first day out.But since you're such
an exceptional beauty. . .. . .I'm prepared to forgive you.Oh, I just love success!-He is a credit to your genius.
-Yes.-A triumph of your will.
-Yes.He's okay.Okay?Okay?!I think we can do better than that.Now, Brad and Janet. . .. . .what do you think of him?Well. . . .I don't like men
with too many muscles.I didn't make him for you!He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.A weakling weighing 98 poundsWill get sand in his faceWhen kicked to the groundAnd soon in the gymWith a determined chinThe sweat from his poresAs he works for his causeWill make him glistenAnd gleamAnd with massageAndjust a little bit of steamHe'll be pinkAnd quite cleanHe'll be a strong manOh, honey

Oh, babyI can make you a manEddie!Whatever happened to Saturday nightWhen you dressed sharp, felt all right
Don 't seem the same since cosmic lightCame into my life
I thought I was divineI'd go for a ride with chicks who 'd go
And listen to the music on the radioA saxophone was blowing
On a rock 'n ' roll showWe climbed in the back seat
We really had a good timeHot patootie, bless my soulI really love that rock 'n ' rollHot patootie, bless my soulI really love that rock 'n ' rollLovely party!My head used to swim
From the perfume I smelledMy hands kind of fumbled
With her white plastic beltI'd taste her baby pink lipstick
And that's when I'd meltShe'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mineGet in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his last songWith your arms around your girl
You tried to sing alongIt felt pretty good
Really had a good timeHot patootie, bless my soulI really love that rock 'n ' rollHot patootie, bless my soulI really love that rock 'n ' rollOne from the vaults.Oh, baby!Don't be upset.It was a mercy killing.He had a certain naive charm. . .. . .but no muscle.But a deltoidAnd a bicepA hot groin

Oh, babyI can make you a manI don 't want no dissensionJust dynamic tensionI'm a muscle fanIn just seven daysI can make you a manDig it if you canIn just seven daysI can make you a manRocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!There are those who say
that life is an illusion. . .. . .and that reality is simply
a figment of the imagination.If this is so, then Brad and Janet
are quite safe.However, the sudden departure
of their host. . .. . .and his creation. . .. . .into the seclusion
of his somber bridal suite. . .. . .had left them feeling
both apprehensive and uneasy.A feeling which grew
as the other guests departed. . .. . .and they were shown
to their separate rooms.Who is it? Who's there?It's only me, Janet.Brad, darling, come in.Oh, Brad!Yes, my darling! But what if--?Everything's going to be all right.Oh, I hope so, my darling.-It's you!
-I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never. . . .Yes. Yes, I know.But it isn't all bad, is it?I think you'll really find it
quite pleasurable.-So soft, so sensual.
-Stop! I mean, help!Brad. Oh, Brad!Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!I was saving myself.Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.Promise you won't tell Brad?Cross my heart and hope to die.Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!It'll destroy us.Don't worry. We'll be away from here
in the morning.Oh, Brad, you're so strong
and protective.You!I'm afraid so, Brad.
But isn't it nice?Why you--
What have you done with Janet?Nothing. Why, do you think I should?You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.-So soft. So sensual.
-No, stop.Oh, Janet.Janet!Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.I thought it was the real thing!Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.You liked it, didn't you?There's no crime in giving yourself
over to pleasure.Oh, Brad, you have wasted
so much time already.Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.You promise you won't tell?On my mother's grave.Master, Rocky has broken his chains
and vanished.The new playmate is loose
and somewhere in the castle grounds.Magenta has just released the dogs.Coming!What's happening here? Where's Brad?Where's anybody?Oh, Brad!Brad, my darling, how could I
have done this to you?Oh, lf only we hadn't
made this journey.If only the car hadn't broken down.If only we were amongst friends
or sane persons.Oh, Brad.What have they done with him?Brad, how could you?But you're hurt.Did they do this to you?Here. I'll dress your wounds.Baby, there. Oh."Emotion: agitation or disturbance
of mind.... . .vehement or excited mental state. "It is also a powerful
and irrational master.And from what Magenta and Columbia
eagerly viewed on their TV monitor. . .... there seemed little doubt
that Janet was indeed......its slave.Tell us about it, Janet.I was feeling done inCouldn 't winI'd only ever kissed beforeYou mean she--?I thought there's no use gettingInto heavy pettingIt only leads to troubleAnd seat wettingNow all I want to knowIs how to goI've tasted blood and I want moreMore, more, more.I'll put up no resistanceI want to stay the distanceI've got an itch to scratchI need assistanceTouch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch meI wanna be dirtyThrill me, chill me, fulfill meCreature of the nightThen if anything growsWhile you poseI'll oil you up and rub you downDown, down, down.And that's just one small fraction

on the monitor.Master.Master, we have a visitor.Hey, Scotty!Dr. Everett Scott.You know this earthling--
--this person?I most certainly do. He happens
to be an old friend of mine.I see.So this wasn't
simply a chance meeting.You came here with a purpose.I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.I know what you told me, Brad.But this Dr. Everett Scott,
his name is not unknown to me.He was a science teacher
at Denton High.And now he works for your government.He's attached
to the Bureau of lnvestigation. . .. . .of that which you call UFOs!
lsn't that right, Brad?He might be. I don't know.The intruder is entering
the building, master.He'll probably be in the Zen Room.Shall we inquire of him in person?Great Scott!Frank N. Furter.We meet at last.Dr. Scott!Brad! What are you doing here?Don't play games, Dr. Scott.You know perfectly well
what Brad Majors is doing here.It was part of your plan, was it not?That he and his female
should check the layout for you?Well, unfortunately for you all,
the plans are to be changed.I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.I know Brad is.I assure you, Brad's presence
comes as a complete surprise to me.I came here to find Eddie.-Eddie? I've seen him. He's--
-Eddie?What do you know of Eddie?I know a great deal
about a lot of things.You see, Eddie happens to be
my nephew.Dr. Scott.-Janet!
-Dr. Scott!-Janet!
-Brad!Rocky!-Janet!
-Dr. Scott!-Janet!
-Brad!Rocky!Listen! I made you. . .. . .and I can break you just as easily.Master, dinner is prepared!Excellent.Under the circumstances,
formal dress is to be optional.Food has always played a vital role
in life's rituals:The breaking of bread,
the last meal of the condemned man. . .. . .and now this meal.However informal it might appear...... you can be sure there was to be
very little bonhomie.A toast.To absent friends.To absent friends.And Rocky.Happy birthday to youHappy birthday to youHappy birthday, dear Rocky-Happy birthday--
-Shall we?We came here to discuss Eddie.Eddie!It's a rather tender subject.Another slice, anyone?Excuse me.I knew he was in with a bad crowd,
but it was worse than I imagined.Aliens!Dr. Scott!Go on, Dr. Scott.Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?Just what exactly are you implying?It's all right!That's all right, Brad.From the day he was bornHe was troubleHe was the thornIn his mother's sideShe tried in vainBut he never caused her
Nothing but shameHe left home...... the day she diedFrom the day she was goneAll he wantedWas rock 'n ' roll pornUnd a motorbikeShooting up junkHe was a low-down, cheap little punkTaking everyone for a rideWhen Eddie said
He didn 't like his teddyYou knew he was a no-good kidBut when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife-What a guy
-Makes you cryUnd I didEverybody shoved himI very nearly loved himI said, hey, listen to meStay sane inside insanityBut he locked the door
And threw away the keyBut he must've been drawnInto somethingMaking him warn meIn a note which reads:What's it say? What's it say?"I'm out of my headOh, hurry, or I may be deadThey mustn 't carry out
Their evil deeds"When Eddie said
He didn 't like his teddyYou knew he was a no-good kidWhen he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife-What a guy
-Makes you cryUnd I didWhen Eddie said
He didn 't like his teddyYou knew he was a no-good kidBut when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife-What a guy
-Woe, woe, woe-Makes you cry
-Hey, hey, heyUnd I didHeyOh.Oh, Rocky!How could you?!This way! This way!Shut up!I'll tell you once
I won 't tell you twiceYou'd better wise up
Janet WeissYour apple pie
Don 't taste too niceYou'd better wise up
Janet WeissI've laid the seed
It should be all you needYou're as sensual as a pencilWound up like an E or first stringWhen we made it
Did ya hear a bell ring?You got a block
Well, take my adviceYou'd better wise up
Janet WeissThe transducer
Will seduce yaMy feet! I can't move my feet!My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.It's as if we were glued to the spot.You are.So quake with fear, you tiny fools.We're trapped.It's something you'll get used to
A mental mind fuck can be niceNo!You won't find Earth people
the easy mark you imagine.This sonic transducer. . .. . .it is some kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular transport device?-You mean. . .?
-Yes, Brad.It's something we ourselves
have been working on for a while.But it seems our friend here has found
a means of perfecting it.A device capable
of breaking down solid matter. . .. . .and then projecting it
through space, and who knows. . .. . .perhaps even time itself!He's gonna send us to another planet?Planet schmanet, Janet.You'd better wise up
Janet WeissYou'd better wise up
Build your thighs upYou'd better wise upAnd then she cried out:Stop!Don 't get hot and flusteredUse a bit of mustardYou're a hot dogBut you'd better not...... try to hurt herFrank FurterYou're a hot dogBut you'd better not...... try to hurt herFrank FurterYou're a hot dogMy God! I can't stand
any more of this.First, you spurn me for Eddie, then you
toss him like an old coat for Rocky.You chew people up
and then you spit them out again.I loved you.Do you hear me? I loved you.And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.You're like a sponge. You drain
others of their love and emotion.Well, I've had enough!Choose between me and Rocky, so named
because of the rocks in his head.It's not easy, having a good time.Even smiling makes my face ache.And my children turn on me.Rocky's behaving just the way
that Eddie did.Maybe I made a mistake. . .. . .splitting his brain
between the two of them.I grow weary of this world!When shall we return to Transylvania?!Magenta. . .. . .I am indeed grateful to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.You have both served me well.Loyalty such as yours
shall not go unrewarded.You'll discover that when the mood
takes me, I can be quite generous.I ask for nothing, master.And you shall receive it in abundance!Come. We are ready
for the floorshow.And so, by some extraordinary
coincidence.... . .fate, it seemed, had decided
that Brad and Janet. . .. . .should keep that appointment
with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.But it was to be in a situation. . .. . .which none of them could have
possibly foreseen.And just a few hours
after announcing their engagement. . .. . .Brad and Janet had both tasted. . .. . .forbidden fruit.This in itself was proof. . .. . .that their host
was a man of little morals. . .. . .and some persuasion.What further indignities
were they to be subjected to?And what of the floorshow
that had been spoken of?In an empty house. . .. . .in the middle of the night?What diabolical plan. . .. . .had seized
Frank's crazed imagination?What indeed?From what had gone before,
it was clear. . .. . .that this was to be no picnic.It was great when it all beganI was a regular Frankie fanBut it was over when he had the planTo start working on a musclemanNow the only thing that gives me hopeIs my love of a certain dopeRose tints my worldKeeps me safe

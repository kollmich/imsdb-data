- Yes.Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?120 years with
my existing power cell.Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?So you can be...
you know, more human?Not such a dork all the time?My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,hat Skynet presets to READ

at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.Why him?In a few months he creates
a revolutionary typeof microprocessor.- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplierof military computer systems.All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,becoming fully unmanned.Afterwards, they fly with
a perfect operational record.The Skynet Funding bill is passed.The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.It becomes self-aware at 02:14 am
Eastern time, August 29.In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?Because Skynet knows that
the Russian counterattackwill eliminate
its enemies over here.Jesus!How much do you
know about Dyson?I have detailed files.Want to know everything.What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.Miles!- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.This thing is kicking my ass.It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.I can't.
I'm on a roll.This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.I know. You told me.It thinks and learns like we do.It's superconducting
at room temperature.Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.Why is that so important?I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel likeI'm going crazy here.Baby, I am this close.Come here.Imagine a jet airliner with
a pilot that never gets tired,never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.Meet the pilot.Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.Your heart and your mind
are in here.But it doesn't love you

I think women
can do anything.Well, I mean,
just because they can,doesn't mean they should,
right?Think about women
fixing cars,driving a taxi,installing
some drywall.- Why not?
- No.Look, trust me.A girl like you,
you don't really want this.- A girl like me?
- Mm-hm.I mean, I want
all my options availableso I can decide
for myself.Ah, Miss Independent.That's right.- That's me.
- I love it.Mm...- Come here.
- Hm...Oh, mm...Except
you're sitting here,eating my food,
enjoying my view.By choice.Mm, I chose you
to join me.- I chose to make you notice me.
- Ah, mm-mm.- That is not your choice, Sabina.
- Mm.That is God's gift to you.Gosh...But don't you think
it's sort ofwhat you do with those gifts
that really matters?Mmm.- Every one of us.
- Mm?Men, women.We all just wanna
fulfill our potential,live our heart's desires.That's the kind of world
I wanna live in.Ah.Well, my world
is me making millionswith you by my side.Hm?It's just that I'm so goodat so many things.- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.Like what?- Well...
- Hm?At my job,it's actually considered
a huge advantage to be a woman.Hm.Yeah,
if you're beautiful,nothing else
is really expected of you.And if you're not,you're pretty much
rendered invisible.- And in my line of work,
- Mm...invisibility,
low expectations...they come in very handy.Housewife, sounds like.Nothing wrong with being a housewife.Just not my choice.- I don't speak Portuguese.
- I know.Yeah, that's it.- Did you know...
- What?That it takes men
an additional seven secondsto perceive a woman
as a threat compared to a man.Isn't that wild?- Who are you?
- Who, me?I'm just the decoy, stud.- How many?
- Nine!Send the lot.You stole aid money from women
and children and refugees!It's called embezzlement!"Embezzlement"?
That's fancy.- You must be the accountant.
- Who are you?Open the safe.Oh, baby, baby,
you swiped right!I'm your girlfriend now!Everything on the bottom row.
Let's go.You're not cut out for this.
I recommend a new line of work.Bosley!Evening, Angels.Well, all this looks
very promising.Outstanding.But what about
Australian Jonny?Ta-da!- Oh, you're gonna regret this.
- Yeah.I was gonna
give you the world.The thing is, is you just talk
way too much.You're super clingy
and come on way too strong.You are the most
incredible woman- I've ever met.
- I know.So that's four months'
surveillance, two countriesand the most embarrassing date
I have ever been on in my life.- Are we good?
- I will address thisto the
U.S. Justice Department,along with, uh,
all your new friends here.- We're good to go.
- Sweet.I'm out of here, man.
I'm gonna take a week off,party my ass off
on a Thai beach.Jane,
you should give it a shot:beaches, letting someone
play with your, uh...I have fun
in my own ways.Oh. Cool.You sharpen
your samurai swords at night?Cosplay Catwoman?I'd actually pay
to see that.Occasionally eat gluten
at night and feel...That was fun.So who were they?You were in the presence
of Angels.But the question is, Jonny...who are you?Hey, Ingrid.You are late.
Mr. Fleming is waiting.Oh, wasn't the meeting
set for 9?Yes, 9 a.m. is when
the meeting starts,which is exactly now.Have you ever spent time
with him? Mr. Brok?No, of course not.He had me over
to his chÃ¢teau,which is in France.And we were sitting there,
and I'm asking him,I said, "Mr. Brok, have you
ever heard of Humphry Davy?"- And he says, "No."
- Oh.I say, "Have you ever
heard of Joseph Swanor Alexander Lodygin?"
"No clue."So I say, "Okay.Uh, what about
Thomas Edison?""Well, of course. Who hasn't?
He invented the light bulb."- Right? But guess what?
- Uh...So did those
other three guys.Before Edison.But Edison
was first to market.Do you see my point?We have a product that willrevolutionize
the power industry.But we have to be first.The time is now.And that's what I told Mr. Brok,
and he agrees with me.Obviously.- I...
- Elena, thank you for coming in.I love how
this conversation went.Technically, I haven't
said anything.Let's not get caught in
a game of who said what.Mr. Fleming, I know how
important Calisto is, okay?I'm the lead programmer on it.
It's my baby.- Yeah.
- But as I wrote in my report,right now
there is a possibilityfor the harmonic range
to be reversed.We both know how dangerous
that could be.Well, I mean, you don't know
what I know. Heh.Y-you know Julio?
The second engineer?He's actually still in hospital
after a brain seizure,and he was only partially
exposed during a test.Allegedly. Allegedly.And Julio was an idiot.All I need is root accessand time
to permanently fix the flawin the blockchain
so it will stay safe...Ingrid,
can I get a cappuccino?Okay. I read your report.I've had others
read your report.We just simply
disagree with you.Has Mr. Brok read my report?
I think that if he read...Let me be crystal clear here.We have developed Calisto
for five years,and we are going to market.It is safe and it is ready,and that's what
we're telling Mr. Brok.And you are telling
Mr. Brok nothing.Look, Elena,
you're much too smartto keep pushing
this forward, aren't you?Good.- I knew who Humphry Davy was.
- Good for you.- You dropped something.
- Oh, no. That's not mine.Well, I don't litter,
so it must be yours.You might need it.Bosley, 001.You old codger.
You really thoughtwe were gonna let you
just sneak away quietly?You didn't have to.It's not just me.<i>Surprise!</i>Surprise!- Hey! Bonjour.
- <i>Buenos dÃ­as, seÃ±or.</i>- <i>Buenos dÃ­as.</i>
- Gang's all here.We all wanted to wish you
a happy retirement.Thank you, Bosley.- And you, sir.
- Bosley.Bosley. Thank you.- You!
- You've had one hell of a run.It deserves to be celebrated.I even put together
a little walk down memory lane.- Shall we? Ha, ha!
- Oh, no, no.Here it comes.Oh, yeah! Ha, ha!- Fresh-faced Oxford graduate.
- Yeah!- Oh, Lord.
- I dug deep. Look at that.That's not a disguise.You clearly had a
lot of fun over the years.You know,
life was good in those days.Where did you get that suit?Monte Carlo.It really happened.
There's the proof.Well, when you opened
the European offices,you took the Townsend Agency
international.None of us would be here
without you.- Yes.
- Especially me. Thank you.Well, I'm very touched.
Thank you. All of you.<i>Say a few words. Come on,
speech, Bosley. Speech!</i>- Oh, no.
- <i>Speech, speech, speech!</i><i>Speech, speech, speech!</i>Uh...Well, frankly,
I am overwhelmed.I'm grateful...for all the work
that we have done together.And, you know,
Charlie wasn't surethat we could replicate
the successthat he had
here in California.- But we made it work...
- That's right....in a world that was
really not ready for the Angels.For 40 years,I recruited them,
I trained them...and I'm so very proud
of them.Bosleys...- you keep them safe.
- Will do.- Hear, hear.
- <i>We will, my friend.</i>And so for me,
as Charlie said,time to make
an exit stage left.Wha... Ah,
speaking of Charlie...<i>Hello, Bosley.</i>Hello, Charlie.<i>If you look around this room,
old friend,</i><i>you'll see the men and women</i><i>who will carry your legacy
into the future.</i><i>Your leadership and commitment
is unparalleled.</i><i>We owe you a debt
we cannot repay.</i><i>So instead,
we got you a watch.</i>- A watch?
- Yes.- Oh!
- Thank you, Charlie.<i>Enjoy your retirement.</i><i>You deserve it.</i>A toast!You really like to party.It's the day drinking.
That's what I like the most.You're not bad either.<i>To Bosley.</i>- To Bosley!
- To all of you.âª This speech is my recital
I think it's very vital âªâª To rock a rhyme, that's right
On time, "It's Tricky" is... âªThank you. That's it.
Please move. He's coming.- For sure.
- Are we ready? Thank you.That was a sick flow,
bro.- Oh, shut up, shut up.
- You really went for it.There's two seats over there.- âª It's tricky âª
- âª Tricky âª- âª Tricky âª
- âª Tricky âªLangston, shut up.Everyone, please help me
welcome our founder,our benefactor,
Alexander Brok.Mr. Brok, you have setthe highest standards
for innovation.I believe that I, along
with a little help from my team,have met that challenge.Today, I instructed
the Hamburg power utilityto disconnect this building
from the electrical grid.But we are far from
powerless.Mr. Brok,would you grant us
root access?<i>Hello, Alexander.</i><i>Root access granted.</i>Calisto,
turn on the lights.Calisto, pair
with sister devices.Calisto, full power.Brok Industries
can power the world.So you went with
rare-earth magnetics in the end?Ah, yes.Inside a cyanide
crystal matrix.- It's kyanite, but...
- Kyanite.- Um, may I?
- Please.You delivered on
the safety protocols?Oh, absolutely. Calisto only
talks with electrical circuitry.The current never touches
people, pets, plants.It's smart, and it's safe.Although, uh, in the spirit
of full disclosure,I should mention
one small thing.It can be manufactured
in pastel colors for the ladies.You...Ah, well, this is it.We can bring clean energy
to everyone.Sustainably.Calisto is the future.And I am holding the future
in my hands, finally.Good work, guys.Good work.Come on, let's celebrate.
Drinks in the bar!Keep your form. Block.One, two.Let's take this one off.
Make it tighter.Okay.Thanks.Paris is not so bad, right?Did you take the apartment
with the good light?Yes. But if you get me a plant...- I'm just gonna kill it.
- Of course.<i>D'accord, d'accord.</i>I'm ready for a new assignment.Listen,
I've set a meeting with a new client.A corporate whistle-blower.Putting a team together.- A... A team?
- Yes.Hey, Bosley.- You wanted to see me, right?
- Ah, yes.Oh, hey.You're the former
MI6 ninja.Is it June?Oh, Jane.Oh, Jane. Jane.
Not the month.Sabrina?Sabina. It's Italian.Oh, are you Italian?No. I... Maybe...We have a situation in Hamburg,
a new client.Hamburg. Interestingly, not
where hamburgers were invented.That was in Frankfurt,where frankfurters were
not invented, which...- I don't think that this is...
- I'm sorry. I'm vegetarian.Thank you very much.
But I recall hearingyou two worked
well together in Rio.I recall her
pushing me off a roof.I recall
it was time to go.Heh. That makes sense.Who's the client?Follow me.- Elena?
- Hi.Welcome.Uh, Mr. Bosley?- Just Bosley.
- Thank you for seeing me. Um...- Would you like anything?
- Uh, espresso, <i>bitte.</i><i>Merci, Ã§a va.</i>Espresso.COS perimeter check."COS"?I have less than no idea
what that means,but you are good up here.I would say,the coast is clear.<i>Yes, exactly.</i>I have thought
about this a lot.All we have to do
is get it to Mr. Brok.<i>And I have tried
to contact him.</i>Well, it takes a lot
to come forward,and I appreciate
your courage.You sure you wanna
take this risk?Yeah.Okay, we can help you.- It's just getting out of hand.
- Stop it, you're so cute.I gotta get a dog.<i>I can't sleep at night,</i><i>knowing and not being allowed
to do or say anything about it.</i>I can fix it,but I just need
the opportunity.I believe you. Were you able
to get the evidence?All my reports, all my data.What can I bring you?Your check, sir.Was that the signal?- Elena...
- <i>What's happening?</i>You need to go
to the ladies' room.- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Quickly.<i>Hey, what's happening? Jane?</i>Now!Hello... Oh, shit!Shit!Ah! Shit, shit, shit!That's my gun.Sabina! Hurry!- Go!
- Go!Yeah! Evac the client!
That's what I was gonna say!Whoa!What's going on?- Oh, God. You're not a waitress?
- No.I'm Jane. Nice to meet you.- Did you bring the big gun?
- In the back.- Can you move your feet?
- Oh, sure. Mm-hm.Oh, do you know how
to use that?Motherfucker!Oh, my God!
Is he shooting at us?!- Hold on, ladies.
- Whoa!Whoa!Is that a tank? Oh, my God.
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?- I think we lost him!
- Bit much for just this girl, no?Who is this chick?Who am I?!Who are you?! Who is he?And why is he
shooting at us?Keep it steady.Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.Oh, no! He's back!Oh, my God!Oh, shit!<i>Merde!</i>Stay low. Stay low.- Do a J-turn on my mark.
- Ready.Now!Bosley.Stay down!Jane!Hey, I said, stay down!Hey! Stop moving!Sandwich?It's tuna.Unless it's cheese,
and it's not good.How about you?
You hungry?Charlie sends love, Angels.Who is she?
Who is she?Hey, she's in shock,
and she smells like puke.Who are you?- I'm Bosley.
- Bosley?Bosley's a rank
in our organization.It's like a lieutenant.The real name of the man
you met was Edgar Dessange.Edgar.Jane, I'm really sorry.- I know how much he meant to you.
- Oh, I don't need a hug.Well, I do.He was my friend too.Hugs work.Okay, let's get you
cleaned up.Come on.Is that a stolen car?Okay.Bosley, 342.
Open Safe House 6.Boz, who else knew we were
meeting with Elena in Hamburg?Well, protocol would
be not to tell anyone.Why do you ask?Well, Bosley...Edgar thought...Okay, you didn't see
this guy.He was a pro, and he brought
a lot of firepowerfor such an easy target.Yeah, he was so extra, right?I could take that girl out
with a flyswatter.He rocks up in this
urban assault vehicle.So we're thinking what?
He was...Maybe she was
being watched...but what if we are?- And by who?
- Hey, you guys. All cleaned up.- Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.I'm kind of getting this,
you know.You guys are
like lady spies and...I just need you to explain
who this guy is- and why was he shooting at you.
- Oh, you.- He was shooting at you.
- Jane.At me?- Oh, God.
- Hey.- Okay.
- Just have some tea.The shooter's a ghost.
Facial recognition's popped himin a few places over the years
but no name, no record, nothing.He's got friends
in high places.- I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm obliged to remind you,Charlie frowns on revenge,
Jane.So, Ms. Houghlin,your file says you are a systems
engineer on the Calisto project.Uh, you know about Calisto?We know about
a lot of things.That you graduated top
of your class at MIT,you take Krav Maga,
you ride your bike to work.You think yellow
is one of your colorswhen, in fact,
it's no one's.That you could be dating moreif you played up the cheekbones
in your online profile pictures.What we don't know is
why someone wants you dead.<i>I know it can be fixed.</i><i>Let's take this
one step at a time.</i><i>There's a flaw in the system.</i>What's the flaw?Calisto can be weaponized.I mean, I can fix it.
But right now,any decent hacker,
curious or criminal enough,could turn Calisto into an EMP
on the human body.An electromagnetic pulse.A brain seizure,
essentially.- Yes.
- See? I know stuff.It disrupts
the neural networksand looks like
a stroke or an aneurysm.So it can be used
without a trace of evidence.A perfect
assassination machine.Yeah.
And it can be triggered remotelyacross the network
that I created.Dope. See, that
is what you can do- if you pay attention in school.
- Who knows about this?I filed a report after
it almost killed my colleagueduring a security test,
but I think it was buried.My report,
not my colleague. No.Julio is fine. He, uh...He just can't speak
or see color anymore.It's not in production yet?No, we're behind schedule,
but there are six prototypesin the Brok facility vault,
plus the one at my labthat I was using
to program the fix, which...Let's get those prototypes
out of there.Uh, I'm sorry. Can we just
hit pause for a second, please?Does your company
have a websitewith an employee directory
with photos?Yes, but Brok Industries is
equipped with insane security.- There's no way...
- There we go.Do you think she still has
security clearance?If she doesn't,
we'll knowthe threat comes from within,
so either way...- We get the information we need.
- No, no, no.No, no.- Ooh!
- No.- No, no, no.
- I...Huh. Hm...- Bowl cuts.
- Bowl cuts.Bowl cuts.Bowl cuts.Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.Just trying
to get to work, Ralph.Well, I gotta do my job too.Okay.- New look, huh?
- Mm-hm.I like it a lot.Aren't you holding
people up, Ralph?Well...you have yourself
a good day.And don't... Don't forget
to smile, yeah?What?How...? How did you
even get in the...?Oh, God. What did
you do to Pradeep?Pradeep Prasad.<i>Nothing. Pradeep's fine.</i><i>I nabbed his ID card
from the gym this morning.</i>Hi.Bye.- Hi.
- Hi.And Sven?<i>I compressed his carotid</i><i>and deoxygenated
his brain stem.</i><i>What?</i>Well, that sounds painful.Yeah, it's like
taking a nap.You smell burnt toast,
then everything goes dark.Hey, don't worry,
he's gonna wake up.Heh, unless he doesn't.- What...?
- We should go.If we're in the building
when they do their sweep,we're going
to German prison.Hm, and then it's schnitzel.
All the time.Not such a bad deal,
actually.Sabina, you get Calisto
from the vault.Elena, you get the prototype
from your lab.I'll keep security
distracted.Okay. You ready?Yeah. High five.
Girl power.Oh.Thank you.No puking.Buggy piece of shit.Whoa... No.- Boz, you with us?
- I'm here. What do you got?Calisto's gone.
It's not here.<i>Someone beat us to it.</i>The plot thickens.
Can you get an ID?There we go. Some guy.
Peter Fleming.Let's see what Elena
comes back with.Hold up. We might have
another problem.Your boy Pradeep
just showed up.Pradeep didn't spin?But he signed up
for the Groupon and everything.Well, he's here.- Ralph?
- Yeah?We've got
Pradeep Prasad here.The system says
he's in the building.Yeah, there's a glitch.The computer
thinks Elena Houghlin is...Right now, I'm sending you
an image of Elena Houghlin.Get it to all our guys.
I want her- detained for questioning.
- Yes.She's in her lab.Let's go.And here comes
the cavalry.The heat is assembling,
ladies.Oh, they know.All right, meet me
at the pickup.Sabina?
This one's real hard.I need you to exhibit
some attention-seeking behavior.I have so many ideas.Houghlin?Where is she?- Where is she?
- I don't know.- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?- Now I got her.
- Where?Here.Eleven?Guys, she's on 11.
Level 11, women's restroom.Hi. Uh, who are you?Shh. Sit down.
Hands where I can see them.Are you with Health and Safety?God, these things
are impossible to open.Um, you're really not supposed
to be touching things in hereunless you're supposed to be
touching things in here.You put your mouth on it.Twenty billion bacteria
reside in the human mouth.You're adorable.Jane?
Jane, is that you flirting?Hey!Stop! Hey!Hey!Oh, come on.You ready?Hey! Hey!- Sorry!
- Hey!Oh, my God!Get back here!Who has eyes on her?She set a fire on four.We are following her
to three.- Let's go, guys! Come on.
- Three? She was on 11.Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!What did you...?- Hold this.
- Okay.Oh, that's...
That's not you.No.- Hold this.
- Okay.Can you unzip me?Yeah, yeah. Uh...Sorry.Bye.- You don't want your...?
- Keep it!- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Susan.Mr. Fleming would like you
in the lab right away.- <i>I'll be right there.</i>
- Okay. Thanks.- Did you see her?
- Yes.Not on-screen. With your eyes!- You go there, you go there. Now!
- Okay!<i>I'm out.</i>I'm out.- Main lobby. I see her!
- Where?!Lobby level.
Lobby level!Let's go, guys. Come on!Put your hands
where I can see them.Get on the ground! Now!Let me see your hands!- Do it!
- What for?I don't know.
I don't know! Ah!I don't know what for.
What are you looking for? Ah!Sorry, Susan."Susan Olsen."Put all the exits on lockdown.
Sweep from the bottom up.Jane. I got it.The unit's gone. We need to go.
Someone beat us to it.Are you kidding?
They were stolen?- Oh, no, no, no!
- Oh!- Oh!
- God!Any ideas?
Is there another way out?Wait, wait. I can hack this.Turn it into an EMP, overload
the electronics in the door.Won't that kill us
in the process?It's short proximity. We should
be okay if we keep our distance.- How far?
- Uh...Here is far enough, I guess.You guess?
Do scientists usually guess?Of course. It's the first step
in the scientific method.Hypothesis.Calisto, short-range
power burst.Okay, it's powering up.
It's powering up.This should work.- Ralph.
- No.God.- I have time.
- No.- I have to. I have to.
- No. No. Stay here!Ralph? Ralph.
Get over here now.- There you are.
- Ralph, it's about to blow.I can't stop it.
Get over here.You think
I'm gonna listen to you?- Ralph, come! Get over here now!
- Put hands where I can see them!Let's get out of here.
Do we need that?- No, it's useless now.
- Then leave it.Move it or lose it, ladies.
Let's go. We gotta go.Come on, come on. Get in.Do you think
Ralph's gonna be okay?Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's fine.- He seemed fine, right?
- Yeah.I'm sure... I'm sure he's okay.
I'm sure he's fine.Oh, well, that's a shame.Obviously, this is
a disappointing setback,but we have time.Do you know what?
Just get John on the phone.Now.Well, then wake him up.Everything all right?Can I have your phone?Bosley, 342.Welcome to the Berlin
outpost of the Townsend Agency.Is there food?
I'm starving.All women are starving
all the time.- <i>Mi chico.</i>
- Here they are. Welcome back.<i>Mi amor, como estas?</i>- Very <i>bien.</i>
- Good.- Cool.
- Well...Hey.You owe me a burpee now, okay?- Hey. Bombay sister. How are you?
- Master.Good to see you.- This is Elena.
- Pleasure to meet you.- Saint.
- Wow.Wow. You have
this beautiful energy.- Thank you.
- Yeah.- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, wait, what?- Oh, my God. Yeah, um...
- Oh, no.I would love to apply
a firm touch to your back.- Do you consent?
- Yeah, sure.Okay. Just let me
try to find this.- Oh! Oh.
- Oh, yeah.- Oh.
- Good?Oh, yeah, yeah. Amazing.Displaced rib.
Very common.If you ever need additional
adjustments, I'm here for you.The Saint takes care
of our health and well-being.- Keeps us in fighting shape
- Yeah. Well, I try.He feeds our mind,
body and soul.Oh, should we take
a moment to remember Edgar?I prepared a mini feastto honor our beautiful friend.I got Pecorino Nero,
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Manchego,- and, of course...
- Thanks.- He loved Brie.
- Yeah.- Ah! And wine.
- Especially wine.Wow, I thought
you guys were gonna serve,like, bean sprouts
and wheatgrass.Eating is all
about the intentionyou put into your meal.If you honor the cow,the cheese is
gonna be good for you.By the way, I understand
the circumstancesthat brought you here
have been stressful.- So stressful.
- If you ever need to talk,I'm a licensed
psychotherapist.Wow. I can really see
why you guys call him...- The Saint.
- Yes. Okay.- Oh, electrolyte-enhanced water?
- Mm, fine.Oh, and also try this. It's
really good for your breath.- Oh, thank you.
- Good.I sent the ID of the last person
to access the vaultthrough our search system,
ran every CCTVand security cam
in Hamburg.Fleming. That's my... That's
the guy that buried my report.- Hm.
- Look. There.He was at the airport
five hours ago.- So he's left Germany.
- With the case.He knows exactly
what Calisto can do.He knows what it's worth
on the black market.If he's selling it,
he'd want you out of the way.- I'm broadening the search.
- I'm sorry.Fleming tried
to have me killed?Maybe. Maybe at
the direction of a buyer.Bad guys don't like loose ends,
you made a fancy new toy...But I worked for him.
I mean...he flirted with me.Oh, honey.A man can love you
and want you dead.Ha, not me.There was a gunfight
at my wedding.- Wait, you're married?
- No. I was the better shot.All right. I need cheese."Cheese." Is that
a code for something?Yes. It's code for
"I'm 40 and single,and I have a cheese-size hole
in my soul to fill."I also have vegan ice cream
for your soul.You really know what I need.I should have
just gone around Flemingand not followed
some stupid chain of command.Gone directly to Brok.
But, no, I just rolled over.You're probably
the last peoplethat would know
what that feels like.I grew up with
major abandonment issues.It led to some pretty
self-sabotaging behavior,which landed me in various
institutional facilities.Charlie bailed me out.And if it wasn't
for Charlie...I'd probably be dead or back
in prison, so I feel you.I pretty much grew up on the
corner of powerless and ashamed.Wait. You grew up on Park
Avenue. Aren't you an heiress?More money, more problems.So, what about you?
How did Charlie find you?Jane is former MI6.
Youngest recruit ever.You worked
for British intelligence?She said "former."I also followed the rules.The chain of command didn't
work out so well for me either.Ralph's dead.I killed Ralph.I'm... I'm a murderer.- No.
- No, no, no.Collateral damage.I wouldn't take that on.The point is, if Calisto
falls in the wrong hands...I mean, we have to get it back
before it hurts more people.Well, now's our chance.Mr. Fleming just cleared
passport control in Istanbul.- Oh, no.
- No.What's your problem
with Istanbul?I got food poisoning
from undercooked lamband yogurt sauce I left out,
but then I got hungry.- What about you?
- Not that.Will you excuse us?We'll be right back.I wanna be sure that assassin
stays away from us.We should keep this quiet until
we know who all the players are.We don't know what this
Calisto is or who wants it,so let's play it safe.What about
Ralph-killer in there?Take her to the closet,
gear her up.And if anybody asks,
we're going to Brazil.Okay.Istanbul.What about Elena Houghlin?I think you know what to do.<i>I took it apart.</i>Nothing. No tracker.It's not emitting
any signals.What had you worried?To be honest, I don't know.A feeling.Something in the bones.
Hmph.Old habits.Perhaps it's simply
that you miss the job.We all get old, my friend.Retirement is not
a death sentence.Says the man
who refuses to retire.Mm, come on.What?Something in the bones,
indeed.Who would do this to you?Someone who knows
I'm on to her.Thank you.Look at this.This is the closet
of my dreams.And I just get
to take whatever I want?- Borrow.
- Oh.Is that an actual rule?Okay. So you wanna start
with a protective base layer.I recommend
a beaded camisole. Yeah?Oh. Some kind
of polymer material.Uh, bulletproof,
composite body armor.It was originally developed as a
protective layer for spacecraft.Yeah. And it's a bra
that doesn't dig. Progress.How we doing down here?Ah, we're still
in the first closet.There's another closet?Hm. Armory open.Jane, I wanna show
you something.- Whoa.
- Come on, check it out.- Here, try these on.
- Oh, thank you.Why? What do they do? Whoa!What do they do? Whoa.Huh. You're younger
than I thought.I've lived hard.Think you can put
that MIT degree to use- with something like this?
- What is it?Universal Interface. Lets you
hack into almost anything.Mm-mm, not almost anything.
Everything.- So here's the new baby.
- What's that?High-velocity rifle, customized
to fire tranquilizer darts.The load: nonlethal,
fast-acting, very potent.Jane, you have
a new cuddle buddy.Oh, Jesus.Shall we fit Elena
with comms?I think so.Oh, that in-ear radio thing
you guys have?Ah, even better.It's a subdermal transmitter.Works through
bone conduction. See?So I'm getting a tattoo?Uh, no. Tattoos are earned
by Angels over time.You'll get
a less permanent version.Yeah, comms are concealed
in the link.As long as you have it on,
you can hear us.Cool. Hey, can I take
these mints?No. Avoid the mints.Actually, let's just stop
the touching around here.- You know, some of this blows up.
- Oh.This place is amazing.It's the crossroads of the world.
Danger and money.We need to figure out where
Mr. Fleming's meeting his buyerand get Calisto back
before it becomesevery bad guy's
favorite new weapon.- Like suitcase nukes.
- Pet tigers.- Jet Skis.
- Sea-Doos.Cars that go fast
really furiously.So how do we find him?Well, we're off
the agency's grid here, so...How do we find him? We hit
the streets. We go old-school.We sling some bills.
We get violent.I feel like a tiger today,
maybe a leopard.But either way,
I am down to get wild.I might have
a contact here.An asset
from when I was with MI6.Uh, "might" as in?As in she definitely
lives here,and she definitely hates me.Practice your English?- Good morning.
- Good morning. Well done.- Candy!
- Candy.Still spoiling
the local kids?You. Get away from me.Fatima, wait.
Please, just talk to me.Talk to someone else. I can't
get involved with you again.Fatima, please wait.I waited for you already.Remember?And I wasn't there for you, but
I don't work for MI6 anymore.- I work for these people now.
- I don't care.I don't help you.You know why.They are very well-funded.
Non-governmental, NGO.They can get whatever you need
to get up and running today.No waiting.
No broken promises.Thank you.It's only tea.What do you want from me?Have you seen this man?Maybe...you know someone who has.Please. I can help you.Rebuild the clinic.- You can help me now?
- I'm sorry.I believed them when they
told me my asset was safe.And I believed you,
but I lost everything.I had to turn away unwed mothers
I could no longer help.I know.It's why I quit.But let me rebuild our trust.I brought you the usual.It's right outside.Show me.I can get you another shipment
in six months.Four.So how long will it take
for your sources to find our guy?Because we really need to...Is this what
the doctor ordered?Okay. Let's get this
off the street.All right.Good job, Jane.Your man is in a hotel.
The Pasha Hotel.The Ibrahim Pasha?Do you know anybody
who can get us into his room?Of course.I will take the van too.Of course.Pasha. Let's go.<i>Let's learn all we can about
Mr. Fleming's trip to Istanbul.</i><i>When Fleming goes out,
we go in.</i><i>Double his devices.
Gather all his communications.</i><i>The when, the where, the who.</i>He's been looking at property
in Costa Rica.And he's got
an offshore bank account.Gotcha.<i>What about me?
What should I do?</i><i>Seeing as you're supposed to be
dead, why don't you relax.</i><i>Fleming could recognize you,
and we can't risk it.</i>No, thank you. Full.<i>Let's get in there.</i><i>Jane, he's almost there.</i><i>Sabina, text him now.</i>Sir, is everything all right?No, I can't find my hat.Let me help you with that.- Your hat.
- Thank you. Yes. Thank you.Have you seen my phone?- Your bag.
- Oh, thanks.- Oh, there it is.
- Thank you.<i>Alrighty, here it is.
We filtered his communications,</i>and it seems Mr. Fleming
is selling Calistotomorrow
at the Turkish derby.Veliefendi Hippodrome.<i>Of course,
this particular racetrack</i><i>is popular with a syndicate
of wealthy businessmen.</i><i>No doubt with connections</i><i>to international arms deals,
drug trade and...</i><i>All parties who might
be interested in Calisto.</i><i>Familiarize yourselves:
syndicate members,</i><i>wealthy horse owners
expected to attend.</i><i>Flag anyone Fleming
could be in business with.</i>I wanna help.Look, I am not
just some frightened girlin your witness
protection program.If you need help getting in and
out of someplace, I can do it.I can hack any system,
and I can do it fast.You need me, Mrs. Bosley.And don't tell me I can't do it
because I know I can.I am... I'm done
sitting still. I'm...I've had a taste.
I want more.I want in.You know, I once saw
a really fat babygiving Eskimo kisses
to a kitten.And that was more adorable.Also, it's implied
that you're comingbecause you're in
this briefing.Yeah, she gave you
the universal hacking tooland the bracelet,
right?Mm-hm. Yeah.But how'd that feel? It looked
like it felt really good.- Felt nice.
- I was just gonna give you- the tablet once I was done.
- Mm.- Uh, carry on.
- Great.As I was about to say,<i>there's a lot of ground
to cover,</i><i>so we're gonna need
to spread out.</i><i>Elena, you'll be
our eye in the sky.</i><i>The track's mainframe's located
just inside the press box.</i><i>We'll get you in. You hack
into the security cameras.</i><i>Watch for Mr. Fleming.</i><i>Jane's on crowd control.</i><i>Turkish derby attracts
thousands of spectators</i><i>who need to be scanned
and assessed.</i><i>Start low, go high.</i><i>From your nest,</i><i>you can provide
tactical support.</i><i>Take out any threats
to the operation.</i><i>Sabina, you'll run
the ground game.</i><i>Once the target's on site,
you make the grab.</i><i>We need Fleming,
his buyer and Calisto.</i><i>No loose ends.</i><i>I'll take care
of the transportation</i><i>and prep for extraction.</i><i>We're taking everybody
out of there with us.</i><i>I have just the vehicle
to do it.</i>Okay, and I'm in.Hey, Jane.Ah, there you are.Comm check. Sabina.Good.- <i>Jane.</i>
- Good.- Elena.
- <i>Good.</i>Don't talk into your bracelet.I just missed a superfecta.Better luck in the third run,
I hope.Hey, what's your bet?Um...The blue one.Mm.Six minutes to post time.
Anybody see anything?Nothing yet.<i>Jane, you got anything yet?</i>Nothing.Excuse me, who is that?Alim Hassan.Qatari prince.- Oh, "Qatari prince."
- Yeah, serious money.- "Serious money."
- Owns hundreds of horses.- "Owns hundreds of horses"?
- Yeah.<i>We get it. He's rich.</i>Is he the buyer?<i>I don't have an angle.</i>Sabina! Fleming.<i>That's him. Light blue suit!</i>Yeah, he's here.That's definitely him. Sabina?Got him.He has the goods.Moving in.Jane?In my sights. Boz?The ride is ready.He's talking to somebody.
Gray suit.Is that the buyer?- It's the assassin.
- Bae showed up.If you think you're
killing him before I kill himI'll kill you first.Take the shot, Jane. Bag him.In the car? All right.- Oh, shit.
- They're in the Mercedes.- There's no sale here.
- We gotta go! Get down here.I'm coming!Shit, shit!Shit!<i>Get a tracker on that Mercedes!</i>On it!Come on! Hyah!Come on.Coming in!Come on. Move, move, move.- <i>Come on, Elena!</i>
- I'm coming!Go, go, go!Come on!- Giddyup.
- Sabina!- Hey, guys.
- Get in here.Okay, punch it.- Here we go! Great job!
- Whoo!How did you...? I didn't know
you could jump horses.- More money, more horses.
- Huh.Can somebody
please track this mofo?We cannot tail him in this.Hold on.They're headed north
out of town.We've left city limits.There's nothing out here
but a rock quarry.Bring up the specs.I'll circle until you signal.The sale will definitely
go down here.Let's take everything.
We don't know who's in there.I-I think
I'm a little overdressed.Okay, um...You need this.I see a way in.Ja... Jane! Jane!Come on.Huh?In your dreams.Hi.Hey, he's gonna wake up.
Come on.You've got all the dots.I signaled you,
you went rogue.- Should we toss him?
- Yeah, let's do it.Man. Whoever Fleming's
in business with,he is in
way over his head.Seal that gate.
Lock them in.- Then lock yourself in here.
- Okay.These are for you.They are not mints.- You got it?
- Not mints.- Let's go.
- Lock this. Not mints.- No, I know.
- Lock it!Okay, the gate is locked. Only
other exit is up three stories.Nicely done, Elena.There he is.- Mr. Fleming.
- Yes.That's Australian Jonny.Didn't we hand him
over to the Americans?Well, he's here.If you think
you're gonna kill mebefore I kill him...What was the thing
you said?So, uh, you are...?I represent a buyer
who wishes to remain anonymous.Ah.- Let's have a look.
- Of course.<i>Guys, that's Calisto.</i>There we go.The money?COD.Plus wire transfer.Great.But before we close the deal,my employer would like
a little demonstrationjust to make sure
the devices do what you say.You want me
to kill somebody?Damn.No, I don't,
but my employer insists.<i>So, yes. Pick anybody.</i>- Obviously, don't pick me.
- Uh...- Sidam, go get somebody.
- Uh, no, no, no.Uh, I-I-I gave you
the report.It's all outlined in there, so
that was never part of the deal.<i>Well, Mr. Fleming,
it is now.</i><i>Look, it's a complicated process.
Obviously, I don't...</i>You don't even know
how it works, do you?<i>It'll require root access</i>or a world-class hacker.Whoa, whoa!What are you thinking?
Bloody hell!That was not part of the plan,
Mr. Hodak!Damn it!Boz, Fleming is down.<i>The assassin works
for Jonny Smith.</i><i>Boz.</i>We need to engage.
Ready for exfil?Let's get out of here! Someone
grab that. Get me out of here.Boz, they are leaving.<i>Go, no-go?</i>Where the hell is she?I can't see her anywhere.It won't open.Well, then fix it.Go upstairs and fix it.Oh, no.
Guys, someone's coming.<i>He's headed your way.</i>Together.- Up there!
- Shit.- Find them!
- Oh, my God. Guys?- Go!
- <i>What's happening?</i>I'll take the assassin.
Cover me.Go. Go, go, go!Oh, Miss Independent.Um... Uh, just a minute!Um, <i>ocupado.</i>Whoa! Oh...- Who are you?
- Gah! Oh!Stay away.
I know Krav Maga.Where you learn?
Shopping mall?One! Two! Three!Krav Maga! Yeah.Don't shoot.Jonny Australia,
the pleasure is all yours.Come on.Jane, where's
that sleepy-neck button?<i>I'm a little busy.
Figure it out!</i>Ooh!Elena? Help me!Ah!Thanks, Elena.I have dreamed of this momentsince the day I met you.
Except your hair was longer.But I like this too.
This is great.- Hey. Don't even think about it.
- You want to run away with me?Oh, you're so desperate.Hey, stop right... Elena!I want to live
to see you again!<i>Close the gate!</i>Too late!<i>Jane, where are you?!</i><i>The assassin's getting away!</i><i>Sabina!</i>Uh...Who are you?Elena, stop this thing!No!Give me the case!Oh!<i>Elena?</i>- Hold on!
- <i>Elena!</i>Elena!Oh, God. Oh, no!Come on. Elena?
I need you, man! I need you!Sabina, stay to the side!Awesome!Get me out of here!Stop it!Elena!<i>It's about to get
very crush-y in here!</i>Jane, we need you!I've nearly got it!<i>Jane, hurry!</i><i>Jane!</i>I'm on my way.Sabina,<i>reach up.</i>Jane! Jane!This one! This one! There!Oh, thank God.Oh, God.You all right, Sabina?!Yeah. Better late than never.Ha!Oh, it's the wrong side.Hey,
did the rookie just tranq herself?Yup.Where's your boyfriend?- Hodak. The assassin?
- Gone.Took Calisto with him.- Where's Jonny?
- He scurried off.He's a little bitch.Where's Boz?We probably
shouldn't be caughtstanding over
a dead body.Not dressed like this, no.Is she dead?You want to touch her?Come on.Touch her.She feels alive!You woke her up.Hey, you.Are we on a boat?Yeah.- Bosley!
- Boz?Mrs. Bosley?Boz.Do Bosleys usually leave?No, this is all wrong.- So she's gone?
- Well, we were made,so maybe she wanted
to do a sweep.Maybe.Or she's...What? No.
Boz was the first Angelto be promoted to Bosley.
She's one of us.She would not be
the first Angel to turn.It's happened.
You know the history.It was her idea to steal Calisto
from the lab.Exactly.
But Fleming beat her to it.It's been our mission the entire
time to get this thing back,and it just keeps
slipping us, like...We're better than that.
It's... It's her.Fleming's dead.
Calisto's gone.And so is she.Jonny said
he represented somebody...What if it's Boz?That's my room.Hello?Charlie sends love.
You're in grave danger.- <i>Get out of there now!</i>
- Guys?Jane?Elena, stay down! Stay down!Elena, stay down! Stay down!I'm Bosley.Let's get you out of here.Quickly.Sabina?Sabina.Sabina.Hey. Sabina.She means
a lot to you.We're new friends.I think.It's been a really
tough week.I can't lose her too.What are you doing?Oh! Oh, God.- Ow!
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.Why are you crying?Oh, I'm not crying. Heh.Well, you are. That's...That's what's...Okay, fine, yeah,
I'm crying.But I didn't think
that you...cared about me.Why?Because...Because you don't think
I have any feelings.No, I...I can be really annoying.Most of the time.You can be so annoying.I don't try to be.
It just sort of...I don't have the filter thing
people have.- Hey.
- I don't knowwhat this is made of,
but it saved your life.Thanks.Where's Elena?I don't know.We have to find her,
so I called in for some help.- Because I got blown up?
- Yeah.But also because...you convinced me I don't
have to do everything by myself.Well done.Hello, Angels.
You owe me an explanation.This is not Brazil.- Hey.
- I brought supplies.Homemade kombucha
with probiotics.And the best part...I brought a friend.You.
You trai...- Hey!
- Jane.I'm not the mole.Then why are you here?The same reason you are.I should be dead.She called me
right after you did.I have an herbal compress
for the bruises.- Nobody wants that.
- Okay. Keep your bruises.So then who?- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.I had some clothes sent up.Take your pick.Um, why so formal?I'm sorry, is this
another headquarters?Have you heard from Jane
and Sabina? Will they come?So inquisitive.Curiosity of a cat.Or a ferret.It's the scientist in you,
isn't it?Just trying
to understand my situation.You wanted an audience with
Mr. Brok to discuss Calisto.Well, soon you'll have one.But Calisto's
been stolen now, so I...Well done.Satisfying when a plan
comes together.We'll give you some privacy.Oh, my...- No way.
- Oh, yes.I've been tracking him
for weeks.<i>When he landed in Istanbul,</i><i>I knew I needed to get to him</i><i>before he got to you.</i><i>Boz, they are leaving.
Go, no-go?</i><i>Boz.</i>Damn it!I'm sorry I left
the quarry, but...more sorry I was too late.I just can't believe that.
A Bosley?Mm, you had no trouble
believing it was me.- You heard that?
- Mm.Australian Jonny.- The one that got away.
- Yeah, again.The last time we saw him,- we were in Rio, and then...
- You pushed me off a roof.- You have got to get over that.
- Oh, my God.I am. Just processing.So then the last person
to see him was...- Was Bosley.
- Exactly.When Jonny
didn't make it to jail,Charlie suspected
Bosley had gone rogue.It turns out
he's building his own network,selling his services
to the highest bidders.He's using us
to date criminals now?Yeah. Jonny, Mr. Hodak, that
assassin, they work for Bosley.He always seemed like
kind of a weirdo.Freaky. English.- So Bosley has Elena.
- Mm-hm.- Do we know where?
- Of course we know.There's trackers
in most of the clothes.You have a lot of leather
jackets at your apartment.- See, I told you it was borrow and not take.
- Shh shh...Brok is hosting a party
at his compound. Elena's there.<i>Every year, he brings together
the wealthy and beautiful</i><i>for his annual Vision Party.</i><i>This year, he's planning to
present Calisto to investors.</i>Why would Bosley want
to take Elena to Brok?Bringing the Birdman
back to Alcatraz, I guess.The who?It's a movie.
Burt Lancaster.<i>Birdman.</i> Michael Keaton.- No, Michael Keaton is Batman.
- No, Ben Affleck is Batman.I mean, is he?Am I the only person here
who knows who Burt Lancaster is?- I'm concussed.
- Doesn't matter.- It's an old movie. It's from...
- How old are you?How old am I? What?
That has nothing to do with it.- I don't have your references.
- There are film buffs- of all ages.
- Let's go get our girl.What do you want with me?Did you raid
your mom's closet for this?What else of hers
do you play with?I've spent an entire career
estimating the talents of women.And you, my dear,are marvelously clever.You betrayed them.You betrayed the Angels.Well, I no longer work
for the Townsend Agency.I was retired.So you are going
to show mehow to hack this
and reprogram root access...to me.You thought Fleming
could do it.He always had a habit
of claiming credithe didn't deserve.- How long will it take?
- Forever. I'm not touching it.Ha, ha, you think
you have a choice.It's adorable.They'll send...
They'll send love.They'll send love.Ooh, feisty.
You've been studying.I hope they come.<i>The compound has
nearly 60 rooms on four levels.</i><i>There's 36 security guards
contracted for the party,</i><i>plus Brok's private crew.</i>That's my song!Oh, did you want one?- I'm good.
- Okay, let's do this.<i>Elena's being held on the top
floor, northwest corner.</i><i>She's our priority.</i>- Oop! Hey.
- This is a private floor.I'm just turned around.
This place is huge.I was looking for
the bathroom.It's just that
I really need to pee.Am I in the wrong place?
I thought may...Sweet dreams.We're in.Why are you doing this?To neutralize an enemy
discreetly and anonymously.That's a gold standard
in my business.What you deem a flaw,
I deem a gift.One that not only
provides power...but confers it as well.Whoa, what are you doing
in my office?Mr. Brok? Oh, my God.
Thank God. Please help me.- What is she doing here?
- These men...John, I'm a little confused.
I thought you handled her.Handled me?It was you?You wanted to sabotage me.What were you expecting,
flowers?A handwritten thank-you note?Get rid of her already.Actually, I believe
that she can still prove useful.- Do you even know who he is?
- Yes. My global security chief.John's just recovered Calisto
from Peter Fleming,that shortsighted,
greedy traitor.They killed him.
They killed Fleming.Whoa, whoa,
la-la-la-la-la!This is the problem
with you, right?You keep telling me shit
I can't know.Plausible deniability.
You ever heard of it?You're a terrible employee.Yeah, and who cares
if people die, right?As long as the investors
are happy.Grow up, little girl.Calisto is about
to change the world.If you want to bake a cake,
you got to break a few eggs.It's omelet. If you're gonna
compare dead people to eggs,could you at least use
the correct phrase?I shouldn't be here, ha, ha.
You're a security threat.You take care of her
and finish what you started.That's exactly the plan.Oh, excuse me.
I have a party to host.- Yo, Tats, move.
- Take a seat, Mr. Brok.Uh, no.Sorry, what
the hell's happening here?Oh, my God.Let me out now.Sorry, you work for me.All right,
all of you work for me!You dumbass. Ha, ha.Why are you laughing?You idiot.They're stealing
Calisto from you.They're gonna use it as
a weapon. To assassinate people.Beep, bop, bloop.Bloop, beep, bloop,
boop, boop!- That ought to do it.
- I think so.If you would grant root access,
please, Mr. Brok.Heh, you're crazy.
Heh, heh.I'm not giving you
my access.You could alter
the blockchain.You could ruin it. You could
literally ruin everything.Ow! Ow!Our intention is
for Calisto to be releasedinto the market as planned.In fact, the more units
there are out therefor me to hack into,
the better.Don't do it.
They've killed everyonewho knows about this
except you and me.Mr. Brok is complicit
in the deaths of two people.- Oh...
- Now, I am very happyto inform my former colleagues
in law enforcement.<i>Hello, Alexander.</i><i>Root access granted.</i><i>âª All I do is win, win, win âª</i><i>âª No matter what
Got money on my mind âª</i><i>âª I can never get it off âª</i>Do you want to answer that?No.<i>âª All I do is win, win, win
No matter what âª</i>Yes.<i>âª ...on my mind
I can never get it off âª</i>Oh, great.
It's an attempted access alerton my personal safe.You're up, my dear.Go to hell.Well, let me see
if I can change your mind.Perhaps if I gave you
another delightful surprise.âª Ah âªLangston. Oh, my God.He's been in there
all the time.You hid a person
in my Louis XIV?What is wrong with you?No sense of humor,
that's your problem.I was hoping
it would be you.- Bitch.
- Fair warning.Since we last met,
I made a friend.Jane, what's the update?<i>Yeah!
We're almost done with him.</i>You sit tight.Switching root access.Name and thumbprint.John Bosley.<i>Hello, John.
Root access granted.</i>- Done.
- Good girl.I'll have to check, of course,
that it's actually working.Calisto, short-range
power burst.- No override.
- Ah, whoa, whoa!What are you doing?
It will kill us.Don't be daft.
It will kill her.And what's-his-name. Not us.We're gonna be downstairs
enjoying your party. Come on.You want me to go down there
and pretend everything's fine?Everything is fine.You're gonna disrupt
the power industry!Go, you.You know, retirement
is better than I expected.I'm so sorry, Langston.
Oh, God!Ah!That guy is a total dick.- Did you get it?
- Yeah, girl, I got you.Of course I got it.Have fun, guys.See ya!- Excuse me. Sorry!
- Hey.Whoop! Yow!This is your party, Alex.
Enjoy it.The world is on fire, Alex.But I'm sure your generation
is gonna figure it out.- Hey, help us!
- There must be a key somewhere.You see, it was
my mentor, Edgar,who taught me
how to win a fight.You thought you beat me
twice before? No.I was learning.You've got seven moves,
Mr. Hodak.I know them all.Seven moves...and a fragile ego.Why is this happening?!- Got her.
- <i>Good job.</i>- Yes! Oh, ho, ho!
- Sabina! Oh, my God.You came for me.
Look at you.- Why is that thing doing that?
- Oh, that? That's nothing.I just programmed it
to light up and make noises.You two, with me.Directly to the exit, please.
Get this man help.Calm down. Get out.
Everybody go.Just get out.Do you really think
you'd kill me, old badger?You know, Rebecca,
I really did.My name is Bosley,and I'm gonna kick your ass.You expect me to go quietly
after 40 years?This is what I do.You're outmanned, Angel.You always have been.Kill her.Send the love.Ingrid?You've been busy.How did you...?It's just business, John.He's with me now.I see.You know, I built this agency
from the ground up.It was supposed to be mine
after Charlie died.I was pushed out.What did you expect me to do?
Take up gardening?You thought you made us.
We made you.- Yeah, we trusted you, you dick.
- Good nigh...I was in the middle
of my speech.Sorry.All right, well...Sweep it clean, Angels.
Good job.So you want to go to California
and train to be an Angel?What? I...Really? You...- Oh, my God.
- We are recruiting you.To be an Angel like...- you and Jane?
- Let's go.What do you
think we've been doing?I don't know.I thought you were smart.Isn't that your thing?<i>It's done, Charlie.</i><i>And I decided what to do
with Elena Houghlin.</i>- <i>What's that?</i>
- <i>She's our new recruit.</i>Good. Thank you, Boz.<i>Good. Thank you, Boz.</i>I appreciate the call.<i>I appreciate the call.</i>- What do you do in California?
- Ever jumped out of a plane?- I don't really do heights.
- Oh, um...- Have you swam with sharks?
- Hey! It's you.How long can you
hold your breath?Sharks? Not long.- Oh, hey.
- Hi.What happened to you?Wait, you guys
know each other?- Yeah, I was eating a sandwich.
- Yeah.- I came in, and you gave me the...
- The phosphorus.That's my favorite
chemical.- Because you were...
- Exactly, mixed with...Um, did you...?Did you do that?Oh, uh, yeah.I think he, uh,
finally got the point.Is that a pun?
Because you impaled him?Are you doing, like, a joke
thing for the handsome nerd?- Of course not.
- I mean, it's working,if that is
what you're doing.So if I'm trying
to get in touch with you,- how would I do that?
- Oh, don't worry. I'll find you.You did that?Yeah.Elena Houghlin.Kelly Garrett.Welcome to the Townsend Agency.You lifted coming
into the last corner.You got to trust it.
Go again.Hands up. No fear.Fight through the pain.Focus.Try to last
90 seconds this time.You must clip the wiresin the correct order,
or you will...- Done!
- ...blow up.Good job not dying,
Houghlin.The rest of you,
clean up and start again.Houghlin, get up! Let's go!
Ten seconds to jump!- Everybody up!
- Okay.I'm not freaking terrified
at all! Let's go!Heaven above,
watch over us today.Don't make me a literal angel.I've been training for
this moment my whole life!All right, recruits!
One final challenge!When Ruth Bader Ginsburg
made this jump in '99...RBG is an Angel?Forget I said that!Let's make it happen!Be the love!Go, Chloe, go! Let's go!Get out of there!
Let's go!Where do you think
you're going?You need to land
this bird, Houghlin.I hope I see you
on the ground.I really, really do.Later.Shit!Shit. Okay, okay.Oh, my God.Okay.- Oh, I've missed her!
- Yes, yes!That's it, baby!
Bring her down!- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yeah!- Woo-hoo!
- Yes!Whoo!- There she is!

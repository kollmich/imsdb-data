WOMAN: Are you there?MAN: I'm here.WOMAN: Help me.
My client is going tojail.MAN: Oh, no, she's not.
I think I've got it.WOMAN: Really?MAN: Look up Hasson v. Conrad.Similar circumstantial evidence,
case was thrown out.WOMAN: Legaleagle, thank you.You are by far
the most brilliant mind in this chat room.MAN: Thank you, Lawyer-girl.I realize we have
certain anonymity here,but do you, by any chance,
have a name?WOMAN: It's Charlene.MAN: I missed you yesterday.How was your day?CHARLENE: Uneventful.
I exercised for an hour in the morning,poked around
in the yard in the afternoon,and visited with a girlfriend
down the block in the evening.MAN: Sounds innocent enough.CHARLENE: Don't let
my humdrum day fool you now.I also have a very dark side.(COMPUTER BEEPS)CHARLENE: Well, I'm 31,with long, flowing locks
and an athletic body.Peter, what do you look like?PETER: I'm a little older. 6'2".My hair is... Hmm... It's light.Uh, it's boyishly light.(KEYS CLACKING)And good night to you, Lawyer-girl.(COMPUTER CHIMES)(TIRES SCREECH)Gendler.- Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
- Hi.- Morning, Peter.
- How are you?(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)Gentlemen.Oh, good. Peter's here. We can begin.Okay. On to pressing business.Word has come to us
that coffee heiress, Mrs. Virginia Arness,has dismissed her current tax lawyers.Virginia Arness,74 years old,
born and raised in Athens, Georgia.At the age of 13, she was shipped off
to boarding school in England,where she's been residing
until just recently.That was only two days ago.Impressive.Now, we've all heard that Mrs. Arness
has a penchant for thriftiness.And that she brings
new meaning to the term "conservative."It's not going to be easy.She's paranoid and suspicious. Peter...TODD: I'm her guy.I'm single.
I'll give her nights, weekends.Aren't you
getting married on Sunday, Todd?That's flexible.And, Peter, I wouldn't
want this to interferewith your family's Hawaiian vacation.You go on. I got it all taken care of.Mahalo.Well, that's very
admirable of you, Todd.I mean, your youth
definitely makes you an ass......et to the company,especially at the annual softball game.But to an archconservative
74-year-old woman?What we will do is not charge
Mrs. Arness one single red centfor her estate planning.Why?Because we don't care
about that measly fee.We use it as a loss leader
to get her corporate business,the multibillion-dollar
Arness coffee conglomerate.(CLEARS THROAT)Hmm.How may I help you, Howie?Just thought I'd congratulate you
on turning it around.Turning what around?You snaked Gendler.Please. Gendler doesn't bother me.(KEYS CLACKING)Oh, that's right. He doesn't bother you.What the heck was I thinking?Listen, I thought maybe after work
you and me go tie one on,maybe check out
some of the local talent.Can't. I'm meeting Mrs. Arness at 6:00.(COMPUTER CHIMES)And by the way it's,
"You and I go tie one on,"not "You and me go."HOWIE: Somebody
messaging you here.Who's Lawyer-girl?- Nobody.
- Whoa!Did someone make
a blind internet date?No. I mean, you know,
well, technically, but no.I met her in a legal chat room.
She's very classy and smart.When do you nail her?I'm courting her tonight at 7:00.Oh, jeez. You're courting her.
Sounds like a hot one.- And this is her?
- Yeah,- she's attractive, isn't she?
- I suppose. I don't know.It's not my cup of tea.What do you... She is universally cute.She's a little too anemic-looking, Petey.I like my jello to jiggle,
if I'm not being too subtle.You're not being too subtle.All right, as long as
she spins your knobs, I'm happy for you.(SIGHS)Have you nailed anyone since Kate?Nail... I was supposed to call her.Sofia, can you
get my wife on the phone?- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife on the phone?SOFIA: Right away.Can't help you with this one, pal.
See you later.(DOOR OPENS)Peter, you cannot
break another promise to these kids.You can't! You just can't.I said I couldn't take them to Hawaii.
I didn't say I couldn't take them.They can spend the week with me.KATE: They are gonna
be so disappointed.I can't talk to you right now.Um... Daddy can't take you to Hawaii.(SARCASTICALLY) Oh, darn.He always does this.(SNIFFS)Sanderson, party of two.Oh, you're the last to arrive.How long has she been here?Mmm, about 20 minutes.Was she trouble?(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)Thank you.Hello. I'm Peter Sanderson.Well, I'm glad they didn't send a child.I told them I specifically
wanted someone my own age.What a wonderful French bulldog.My mother had one.
They make great companions.- (BARKS SHARPLY)
- What's her name?His name is William Shakespeare.Well, of course.Now, I've heard about
your unfortunate escapade.I don't have escapades.Fiasco with your previous attorney.The man was a thieving criminal.Just because I have a lot of moneydoesn't give people the right
to overcharge.I do not enjoy being taken advantage of.Which is why
our service is free of charge.After all,
you worked hard for your money.I'm an heiress.An heiress who worked hard
to keep her money.Now, shall we get down to business?Fine.So, now you may
hand over your proposal.I'll take it with me.Proposal?Well, I was expecting
to meet with you tomorrow.I was assured the proposal would be
ready for this afternoon.I see no point in our meeting tomorrow.- Until I...
- Excuse me. Madam, I'm sorry.We have a no-dog policy in the lounge.- (WHINING)
- Unfortunately, I'm gonnahave to ask you to remove the dog.Excuse me. I am Mrs. Arness' attorney,and because there is
no sign posted regarding dogs,that means there is
no policy toward dogs.Now, if you want to
avoid a legal situation,I would suggest you run to the kitchenand get some tuna tartare
for William Shakespeareon the house.Yes, sir.I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.Where and when tomorrow?WOMAN: Hello, Mr. Sanderson.Oh, Mrs. Kline. Always a pleasure.And when am I going to get to babysit
with your charming little Georgey again?Oh, uh, well, soon,because he just loves
coming over to your place.(LAUGHS) Mr. Sanderson?Those Latin people
who were skulking around...Oh. They were looking
at the Aruda house.Casing it?No, to buy it.(LAUGHING) Oh, please.If they're in this block
and not carrying a leaf blower...(LAUGHS) Yeah.Well, I'd love
to discuss this with you further,but I'm expecting someone.Oh.Yeah.Hey.(GRUNTING)Hi.(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)(SNIFFS)Yeah.(DOOR BELL RINGS)(CLEARING THROAT)I hope you like cham......poo.What's up, baby?Oh, champagne.
I love champagne. This for me?Oh, I'm sorry.
I think you have the wrong house.It is damn good to finally connect.- Pardon me?
- It's me, fool. Charlene!Oh! Food.- What?
- It's me, honey.Your date. Lawyer-girl.You can't be.
Hey, hey, hey. Leave that alone.Well, why can't I?Because you're not a blonde.Can't get nothing past you. (LAUGHS)You must be a bomb-ass lawyer.Oh, look at all of these pretty candles,
all romantic and shit.Somebody was planning
on getting some booty tonight.Hey! Leave that alone.
There are settings.And you can't be Charlene,
because Charlene is more of...Skinny white broad?- Yeah.
- (LAUGHING)You know, I get that a lot.But that's your fault
you're thinking that, bro.You must have not
have took a good look at that picture.I have looked at that picture a lot,
and trust me, you are not in it.Mmm-hmm.(SUCKING)Move, move, move.
Let me do it, let me do it.See?There I am.Sorry you got it twisted, dog.I don't get a lot of photo ops
where I been.Where exactly have you been?Oh, I got a rumble in the jungle.We still having dinner or what?I asked you a question.- Rolex.
- Rolex?I did time, baby, but I ain't do the crime.You're a convict?Bump that.Shoot, Roscoe cracked that door.I kicked it off the heezy and bounced.
For real, though.What did you just say?What, don't you hear good?All right. Let's see. How can I put this?I was recently liberated
from a correctional facility...All right. I get it.You're in the big house,
and you get someone to type for you,and you get on the internet,
and you misrepresent yourself.It happens, and I'm a sucker,but now you have to go,
because this is over.Uh-uh. No, no, no, biscuit.You misrepresented yourself.Boyishly light... Please! Gray.You said you was a criminal lawyer.
I pulled your file.You're just some
sorry-ass tax attorney.A tax lawyer is a criminal lawyer.Oh, yeah?Well, good, 'cause that's why I'm here.Well, do tell.Well, I want to reopen my case.And what did you do,
smoke some homies on a drive-by?Smoke? Homies?Well, you're a regular gangster, huh?No, man. I was in for armed robbery,
but I didn't do it.Yeah, nobody did it.- Now, you have to go...
- No, I really didn't do it.I can't be having this conversation- because you're a criminal-type.
- I'm not a criminal!If I was a criminal,
I would have shanked youwhen we were standing right there
and I had that knife in my hand.Just the fact that you even said
that raises a problem for me.- But I didn't think that...
- It's just time to go.Please, just listen to me.
Just give me one second.No, I don't have a second.Okay, look,
can I just say something, please?- What?
- I didn't do the crime.You rude mother...(LOCKS CLICKING)- I ain't goin'.
- Stop!(SIGHS)CHARLENE: (SOBBING) It is your baby,
Peter, and don't you deny it!That DNA test told on you!You lie, Peter!You know little Kareem is yours!(WAILING) Why?How you gonna do me like that, Peter?You told me I was
your beautiful African queen.And I loved you for that, Peter!I didn't care
if your little thing was curved.And little Kareem don't
want your child support.He just want a relationship
with his white daddy.A little chocolate vanilla swirlfrom that magical night
at the crack house.- Oh!
- (GRUNTING)Come on. Just be quiet!CHARLENE:
Wait just a second. My shoes.MRS. KLINE: Mr. Sanderson?
CHARLENE: Whoa!MRS. KLINE: Is everything okay?I thought I heard Negro.- (BUSHES RUSTLING)
- No.No Negro spoken here.Oh.Well, good night, then.Oh... Uh...Good night.Come on! Come on, come on!You stay. You stay. You wait right there.- Who you callin'?
- (PHONE SPEED-DIALS)The police.(TELEPHONE RINGS)WOMAN: Police department.
Sergeant Panella. Please hold.- What's that?
- It's all of our e-mails.You think anybody
at Tobias, Kline, and Barneswould be interested
in hearing about you lookingfor boom boom in the federal pen?And I'll send a photo.WOMAN: Thanks for holding.
Can I help you?(IMITATING ASIAN LANGUAGE)Now, this is just for tonight, understand?All right.I can work with this.But look, don't be gettin' no ideasabout sneakin' up in here
and hittin' this ass,'cause you blew your chance
with this fine sister.Dare to dream.(CLICKS TONGUE) Please.(DOOR CLOSES)Oh, my God! A bed!Oh, a nice, big, cushy bed.Oh! No roommates, no cellmates...(LOUD SNORING)(SNORING CONTINUES)Charlene?Charlene.(SNORING CONTINUES)Charlene! Come on,
you're not fooling anybody.Who that? Who there?Who want it with Lene?I put some bagels outside.I thought we could discuss your case.Ah!What up, dog? Where them bagels at?Hey, guess what, girlfriend?
Your game is up.Because I burned all those e-mails,including the second set
I found hidden in the lining of your coat.And I deleted everything
off my computer.So I never met you,
and you never met me.Don't even try, girlfriend,
because it's locked.And now, I am going to go get my kids,as in innocent young personswho will never even know you were here.
So now just go.Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!And locky locky!So ta-ta! And watch out.
The gate closes automatically.Well, what about my stuff?Oh, it's right there on the street.You put my stuff on the trash?Oh. (LAUGHS) Well, you know what?I wish you well. I really do.And you know what?
I had a great, great time.It was really fun.So... Oh, well.I guess I'll just see you in my next life.Bye! (LAUGHING EVILLY)Ha-ha. I'll see you when you get home.ASHLEY: So I said to him,"Just 'cause you whisked me off to Paris
on your private jet"doesn't mean I'm gonna
sleep with you."What does he think I am? A hooker?SARAH: Can Aunt Ashley
edit herself, please?(SCOFFING)You stayed in the same room with him.

Plenty of floor space.Sweetie pie, have a wonderful time.
I love you.And please be good to your brother

you were going to be here.What a pleasant surprise.Peter, you're almost aging well.PETER: Okay,
here's what we're gonna do.I thought we'd go down to the club
and we'll all take a swim.How does that sound?(MOCKINGLY) Ooh,
that sounds much more fun than Maui.You know, Ashley,
not all of us earn our livingby milking rich geriatrics
out of their money.Some of us have to work for a living.Peter, you sound much more intelligent
with your mouth shut.Oh, let's not start this.
I don't have time. Kids, go get your stuff.All right, fine.But I warned you about marrying
the first jerk-off you met out of college.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date.Don't be good.What morgue did you find this one at?Stop being so childish.(KNOCKING ON DOOR)Hey.Wow! You look beautiful.Thank you.Hi.Peter, this is Glen.Hey.Hey, Mr. Sanderson. Nice to see you.Yeah, nice to meet you.Uh... What do you say

and then one dayyou wake up in Thailand,
missing a kidney.I mean, he could have
made up this whole golf identity.He caddied for you when he was 14.That's little Glenny?Does that bother you?Not at all.
Go have fun on your statutory weekend.(SIGHS)This does too bother you. I know you.- Do you want to talk about it?
- Well, look...- I mean, it just looks a little silly.

Some things never change.I can't talk right now.Well, put him on.Hi.You promised us
you'd take us snorkeling.Things come up. That's life.I know. I'm really, really sorry.

How's school?I don't like school.Well, nobody likes school, but come on,there must be something
you like about it. Come on, one thing.He got into a fight the other day.Why? Why? Why'd you get in a fight?Some kids called me a baby
'cause of the way I read.Hey, some of the greatest minds
of all time had trouble learning,like Edgar Allan Poe

answer that, are you?Well, it might be...
Might be one of my kids.Just one minute.Sorry.Hello?Hey, it's me.Oh, hi, Ashley. Everything okay?I don't know.I saw Peter hanging out
at the club today.He was mingling with
a large black woman.What? What are you talking about?He said it was his nanny.She didn't look like
any nanny I'd ever seen. She was all...Tattooed and banjee and welfare-ish.- It was...
- (LAUGHING)Oh, is that funny to you? Is that funny?(LAUGHING)Am I funny to you?No, no. That's not funny.Were you laughing at me?Oh, I wasn't...
(GIGGLES) Stop. Get away.No, I wasn't laughing at you.Just... Hang on.You know, look, I know Peter.
I know him.He's not gonna spend
all his time taking care of the kids.He went and hired somebody!Seriously, Kate!
This woman was no nanny.You need to do something.I saw this woman.
I was there, you weren't.Shouldn't you at least
be looking at references?Thank you. Thank you.Listen, Peter is nothing
if not responsible.It's not like he's gonna
hire a convicted felon.- Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
- Oh!Okay, let's see. We got
resisting arrest, assaulting an officer,repeated attempts at eye-gouging,and scrotum crushing.Well, I was a little riled up,
being framed and all.And your clothes and ID
were found at the scene.All plants. I never robbed nobody!Okay.I know my rights. I get an appeal.- I get an appeal!
- No.You only get an appeal
if you were convicted and incarcerated.You were released.Look, why don't you just start over?(EXHALES DEEPLY)Go back to school
and get at least a passing familiaritywith the English language.I mean, it's no end to what you can
accomplish with a little commitment.My daughter, Sarah, is fully committed,and she's going places.Oh, she's goin' places, all right.HOWIE:

Come in, have a seat, spend some time.Thanks, homeboy, and, no,
it can't wait. You gotta check this out.- What is it?
- I found the deposition.The prosecution interviewed
an eyewitness,and she told them that the perpetrator
didn't have a tattoo on the chest.They never told my lawyer
about this shit.- That's withholding exculp...
- Exculpatory evidence.People v. Stanley, I know.How do you know that?Why wouldn't she know that?
She's got it goin' on.Damn, Pete,
all I did in there was read law books.And with comprehension.Made you think I was a lawyer.I mean, you obviously have
pockets of intelligence.So, why do you
walk and talk and act the way you do?Because it's sexy.(SCOFFS) It ain't actin'!This is who I am.I mean, you think I can't talk like you?(IN REFINED ACCENT) Oh, Peter,I absolutely love
what you've done with the place!It's so sterile, so bland, so wonderful!See? You can do it.(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
Oh, you like that, huh?Well, you can kiss my natural black ass,
because I don't need your approval.No, she don't need your approval.Hey, you don't think
I compromise the way I act?You think I like walking around
like an uptight honky?Yes. I know your lingo.(TELEPHONE BEEPS)SOFIA: Peter, Mr. Tobias

that another firm's in the runningfor the R&S account.We need to close this deal.Look...I have no problem
being Peter's wingman on this one.Oh, well, thanks anyway,

if there's enough food.(STAMMERING) I'm not... I'm not sure,because, uh, actually,
this is the night of, uh,Yiminum, the, uh... The holiday wherewhite people eat very little portionsbecause that was
the night the Lord came downand he was given food,and there was just too much
and he said, "No."And so, he had a smaller portion,and that's why
we might not have enough.So, I'll just go check
on what the Lord would say.Just one second.SARAH: Come here, William.Hey, come here.GEORGEY: Are you hungry?Charlene, if there was ever a time
I needed a favor, it's now.Okay. You got it, baby. Anything.Oh, thank you!Oh. Mrs. Arness?- Yes? Oh, yes.

we can sign the contracts.Of course.CHARLENE: Dinner is served.MRS. ARNESS: I was raised
in the South, you know.That smells just like our Ivy's jambalaya.She was so wonderful.We paid her nothing,

I'll trade with you.Oh.Thank you.What, Charlene?(SIGHS)Nothing, sir.Oh.MRS. ARNESS:
Oh, this food is so delicious.Serves him right, anyway,
makin' me wear this stinkin' outfit.MRS. ARNESS: You're very lucky
to have found such talented help.Well, our Ivy was with us for so long,we really thought of her
as one of the family.Mmm.And after every meal,my mother would
scrape all the food we hadn't eatenand put it on one big plate
and give it to Ivy.(GULPS)Charlene, what is
that particular taste? I...It is... It's familiar, yet...Is it some kind of herb like sage?No, it's sort of more like a milk of mint.Milk of... Whatever it is,
the taste is explosive.Mmm.Well, good, then. Enjoy.MRS. ARNESS: Oh, just one moment.Uh, you know, uh,
there's a lovely, sad Negro spiritual...(COUGHS)...that Ivy's brother used...Are you all right?Anyway, Ivy's brother used to sing this

You saw her and where is she?I don't know where she is.(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Don't drop the soap.What the hell does that mean?I just don't believe this, Peter.
I'm worried about her.I hate the fact
that she's out there all alone.You're worried about
the poor, innocent, frail creaturewho can hardly take care
of herself on the street?What about me?
Tobias is gonna fire me!Oh, and another goody,if Arness calls the cops,
I could go to jail!Here's the local number for the Bureau.The FBI takes harboring
a fugitive very seriously.You gentlemen
will be the first to hear from me.Arness didn't call the cops,
she called the FBI.- Now, you haven't seen me.

What are you... What... What... Peter!If you do hear from her,please tell her the cool points

I'm helping her.Bullshit!- Ugh!

to my headand tells me not
to reopen the case.I'm thinking, "Why is he doing this?"And then it dawns on me,
it's because he was involved.God damn him.I can't believe Widow did this to me.- Where do you think he is?
- I don't know.Probably downtown at this club
he hang out at called the Down Low.Got to get a confession.You can't go there.Eh, man, I'm serious.A white man at the Down Low
is either a cop, a corpse, or a crackhead.You can't even talk hood.I'll figure out something.Oh, and Howie told me to tell you
that the cool points are out the windowand you got him
all twisted up in the game.Really?That's the nicest thing

I'm not here to cause any trouble.Well, that would be a first.Julia? Julia?Julia a little tied up right now.Please, I just need you

1
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,883
He even took
the Gramophone on safari.

2
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:56,783
Three rifles...

3
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,900
supplies for a month and Mozart.

4
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:07,307
He began our friendship
with a gift.

5
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:10,768
And later...

6
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,399
not long before Tsavo...

7
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,446
he gave me another.

8
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,940
An incredible gift.

9
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:22,863
A glimpse of the world
through God's eye.

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,033
And I thought...

11
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:29,040
"Yes, I see.

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,169
This is the way
it was intended."

13
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,754
I've written about
all the others...

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,970
not because I loved them less...

15
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:44,933
but because
they were clearer, easier.

16
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,061
He was waiting for me there.

17
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:56,279
But I've gone ahead of my story.
He'd have hated that.

18
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:59,401
Denys loved to hear
a story told well.

19
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:04,038
You see...

20
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,115
I had a farm in Africa...

21
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,660
at the foot of the Ngong Hills.

22
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:12,161
But it began before that.

23
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,664
It really began in Denmark.

24
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:24,513
And there I knew two brothers.

25
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,386
One was my lover,
and one was my friend.

26
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,766
- It's too cold for champagne.
- It's too cold for anything but.

27
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,321
You said you'd be at Klampenborg.

28
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:42,030
I thought I'd come,
but then I didn't.

29
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,781
Was it fun?

30
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:52,790
Tanne?

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,371
Tanne, come on.

32
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,838
It's not as though you loved him.

33
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,133
You'd like to be a baroness,
that's all.

34
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,260
- He lied to me.
- Of course.

35
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,099
Would you be in bed
with him otherwise?

36
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,138
My brother's only dull,
but not stupid.

37
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,353
Pretend it's Hans.

38
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,779
- Where would you go?
- Anywhere.

39
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,814
America. Ceylon.
I would even go to Australia.

40
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:28,156
Well, perhaps not Australia.
But I've got to be away from here.

41
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,288
I'll give you all I've got.

42
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:35,714
That should get you into town.
God, it was fun.

43
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,882
- You could marry me.
- I have to marry a virgin.

44
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,174
I can't stand criticism.

45
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,053
For the money, I mean.

46
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:46,887
Probably.

47
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,060
Bror, listen to me.
I've got no life at all.

48
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,435
They wouldn't teach me
anything useful.

49
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,189
Now I've failed to marry.
You know the punishment for that.

50
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,401
"Miss Dinesen's at home."

51
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:03,356
You've gone through all your money.
You're off seducing the servant girls.

52
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,242
We're a pair, you and I.

53
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,779
I mean, at least we're friends.

54
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,660
We might be all right.
And if we weren't...

55
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,624
at least we'd
have been somewhere.

56
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,914
You don't think
you're being too romantic?

57
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:27,214
Am I supposed
to think you're serious?

58
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:33,683
I had a farm in Africa.

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,936
I had a farm in Africa...

60
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,361
at the foot of Ngong Hills.

61
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,150
I had a farm in Africa.

62
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,660
- Good morning.
- Have you had trouble?

63
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,747
Now and then. Have you?

64
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,749
No. I'm travelling to Nairobi.

65
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,751
Well, you caught
the right train.

66
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,672
Get away! Shoo! Shoo!

67
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,966
That's all my crystal.
My Limoges.

68
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,555
They didn't know
it was Limoges.

69
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,977
So you plan to stay, then?

70
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,905
I've come out to marry Baron Blixen.
Do you know him?

71
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,489
- Bror? Yes.
- We plan to start a dairy.

72
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,616
Are you quite famous?
They stopped the train for you.

73
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,576
It's rude not to here.

74
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,668
A dairy. Isn't it a bit soon
for milk at the door?

75
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,457
- Aren't you boarding?
- No, I'm going on.

76
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,129
On? To where?

77
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,837
Mention the ivory to Berkeley Cole.
Bror knows him.

78
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,971
I'm Baroness Blixen!

79
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,434
Not yet.

80
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,012
Finch Hatton, Denys!

81
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,778
Msabu, I am Farah Aden.

82
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,322
We can go now.

83
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,158
- Where is Baron Blixen?
- He's at Muthaiga.

84
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,152
Please, come.

85
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,454
Where is Muthaiga?

86
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,038
Muthaiga is a club
where British go for drinking.

87
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,383
Please.

88
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:25,769
Listen. On the train are my crates
with china and crystal.

89
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,098
- Do you know china?
- Yes, msabu.

90
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,268
China, it can break.

91
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,739
Stay.

92
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:33,125
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Baron Blixen.

93
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,840
Rajiv.

94
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,888
- Yes. I wondered if you might...
- Memsahibs must not be here.

95
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,309
- I'm simply looking...
- Memsahibs must not be here.

96
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,776
Where have you been?

97
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,574
- Where have you been?
- Arranging things.

98
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,822
How was the trip?
You can tell me later.

99
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,163
- Would you like to change?
- My luggage is still on the train.

100
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,918
Room "D," head of the stairs.
I haven't done anything about a ring.

101
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,083
- Do you care?
- Did you think I wouldn't come?

102
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,130
I didn't think you'd want to spend
the money. You will love it here.

103
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,546
Servants are wonderful.
Shall we get a drink?

104
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,549
We've got almost one hour
before the wedding.

105
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,184
One hour?

106
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,773
- Is it all right?
- I wondered what colour you'd choose.

107
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,155
It's ivory.
Oh, my God.

108
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,367
- I've got this man's ivory.
- Whose ivory?

109
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:08,138
I'm Sarah, Lady Belfield.
Shall I stand up for you?

110
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,852
- Thank you.
- Short or long?

111
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,855
Long, please. Give me time
to adjust to it.

112
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,601
Settle down, all.

113
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,399
By the authority of
His Majesty's government vested in me...

114
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,240
I declare that
the Baron Bror Von Blixen...

115
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,613
citizen of Sweden, and...

116
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,370
- What's your name, my dear?
- Damn it, Henry, I told you her name.

117
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,533
Karen Christentze Dinesen.

118
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,535
Karen Christentze Dinesen...

119
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,537
a female subject
of the King of Denmark...

120
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,918
are henceforth united
man and wife.

121
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,634
God save this company.
God save the king.

122
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,474
Thank you for this.

123
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,888
Did you hear about Shuttleworth?
No, I said.

124
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,599
"He's living up country," he says
"in a tree with a baboon."

125
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,852
"Male or female?"
I said to him.

126
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,570
"Female, of course." he says.

127
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,981
"There's nothing queer
about old Shuttleworth."

128
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,947
Sarah, where's
your muddle-headed husband?

129
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,081
The governor's at the punch bowl
hoping to avoid you.

130
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,950
Would you like to meet the bride,
or did you just come for the whisky?

131
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,750
Not for the company,
God knows.

132
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,042
Lord Delamere,
may I present Baroness Blixen?

133
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,049
Baroness Blixen,
Lord Delamere, such as he is.

134
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,097
Baroness.
A Swede, are you?

135
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,885
No. Danish, actually.

136
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,062
The little country
next to Germany.

137
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,232
If it comes to war,
where will Denmark stand?

138
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,435
On its own, I hope.
We do have that history.

139
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,359
Is there something we can call you
that gets around this "baroness"?

140
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,360
What do they call you?

141
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,861
"D," if I'm lucky.

142
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,633
My stupid name's Felicity,
but I do like your dress.

143
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,843
Oh, thank you.

144
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,840
That's not much
of a hat, though.

145
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,851
It's meant to be stunning.

146
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,763
We die of sunstroke here.

147
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,097
At least
I'm safe from the mosquitos.

148
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,769
The big ones.

149
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,979
- Good Lord.
- You nervous?

150
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,980
Should I be?

151
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,361
You know.

152
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,363
Wedding night
and all that.

153
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,512
So they're both naked
and not a shrub in sight.

154
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,850
Karen, have you met
Vicky Gresham?

155
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,771
Hello, Baroness.
I'd curtsy, but I'm drunk.

156
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,527
- May I see you, please?
- Excuse me.

157
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,614
If you want any friends,
I'd make them here.

158
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,198
- There's no one else.
- I want to see my house.

159
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,952
You may want to change.

160
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,949
It's a two-hour ride.

161
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,879
Excuse me.

162
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,645
My God,
these people drink.

163
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,693
I'm sorry. I was just...

164
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,363
- I'm afraid...
- No, it's all right.

165
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,987
I'm afraid you've
caught me snooping.

166
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,912
It's not my room. It's Denys's.
And Denys won't mind.

167
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,539
That's the thing about Denys.

168
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,624
Are you Cole?

169
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,583
Berkeley Cole.

170
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,543
I brought the ivory with me
on the train.

171
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,828
Well, thank you.

172
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,712
- You taking your quinine?
- Oh, yes.

173
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,759
He has got lovely books.

174
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,392
- Does he lend them?
- We had a friend...

175
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,641
Hopworth, he'd got a book
from Denys and didn't return it.

176
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,274
Denys was furious.
I said to Denys...

177
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,145
"You wouldn't lose a friend
for the sake of a book."

178
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,400
He said, "No, but he has,
hasn't he?"

179
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,034
- Did you come out through London?
- No, from Rome, actually.

180
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,875
I thought you might
have a newspaper.

181
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,248
No. Sorry.

182
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,254
Oh, nothing in them anyway.

183
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,089
I had a friend who I used to take
to the dances at Oxford.

184
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,799
They were in June
by the river.

185
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,017
She always wore
a new silk dress.

186
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,473
I think you're
wearing her perfume.

187
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,654
It's very nice,
but it's not the same.

188
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,113
We can go now.

189
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,631
This is Belknap.

190
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,470
- He runs the farm.
- Good evening, ma'am.

191
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,942
This is your cook.
Name's Esa.

192
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,028
And this is Juma. Houseboy.

193
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,410
Come. See your house.

194
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,589
When you leave me,
I'm going to marry Berkeley Cole.

195
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,423
- A man in trade.
- Is that what he does?

196
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,420
He's thick with the Somalis.

197
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,048
There's a crowd of them on his land
who think he's a prince.

198
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,467
He sells
Finch Hatton's ivory.

199
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,645
Belknap is a cheery sort.

200
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,563
Had a place of his own.
Went belly up trying to grow flax.

201
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:18,156
- Does he know cattle?
- I didn't buy cattle.

202
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,075
We're going to grow
coffee instead.

203
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,284
That's not what we planned.

204
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,166
You were in Denmark.
I had to decide.

205
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,043
We made a decision.

206
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,842
We don't know anything
about coffee.

207
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,462
- You plant it, it grows.
- We said a dairy. My mother...

208
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,925
Your mother doesn't care if it's cows
or coffee as long as it pays.

209
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,053
You have to be with a herd
or things go wrong.

210
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,017
I didn't come to Africa
to sit with silly cows.

211
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,144
Just tell her we changed our minds.

212
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,774
Next time you change your mind...

213
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,820
you do it with your money.

214
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:05,111
They bought you a title, Baronessa.
They didn't buy me.

215
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,330
Fetch some wine
for my lover's brother.

216
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,335
I think you're tired.

217
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,135
Be careful.

218
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,681
Did I tell you
Hans came to say goodbye?

219
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,247
Where is Baron Blixen?

220
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,207
- He's gone to hunt.
- Did he say when he'd return?

221
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,709
He says he can come
before the rain.

222
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,430
Is it going to rain today?

223
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,684
It can be many days
before the rain, msabu.

224
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,513
In Ohio we put up scarecrow
to keep the birds away.

225
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,385
Here, you hope there's enough leopard
to keep down the baboon.

226
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,967
They'll take your dog too.
But that's Africa.

227
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,849
- How much will we plant?
- A thousand acres.

228
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,558
- How long will that take?
- That depends on Kinanjui.

229
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,317
He's chief of the Kikuyu.
Gotta deal with him to get your help.

230
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,569
- When will be our first harvest?
- Well, these are seedlings.

231
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,948
It'll be three,
maybe four years.

232
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,410
- Four years?
- If they bear at all.

233
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,575
No one's ever
tried coffee this high.

234
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:22,715
- What will we live on for four years?
- I'm working to get home.

235
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,754
If you haven't got it, be good
if you could tell me right now.

236
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,471
We will plant 500.

237
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,147
Chief Kinanjui,
I've heard you're wise...

238
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,140
Not now, please.

239
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,641
And I look forward
to our dealings.

240
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,440
Your Kikuyu are good workers...

241
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,148
and I look forward
to dealing with them...

242
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,950
honestly and fairly.

243
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,609
Msabu, this chief
has no British.

244
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,574
- Tell him I am Baroness Blixen.
- Chief knows that, msabu.

245
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,712
Well, then tell him what I said.

246
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,659
What did he say?

247
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,622
He says this Kikuyu
can do this work.

248
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,335
What else did he...

249
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,357
Your leg is very sick.

250
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,696
You must come
to the house for medicine.

251
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,253
- Does he understand me?
- Yes, msabu.

252
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,049
If you don't come, the other boys
will say you are afraid.

253
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,304
I, myself, will think
only that you are foolish.

254
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,765
This boy must
come to my house for treatment.

255
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,764
See that he does.

256
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,271
What else did Kinanjui say?

257
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:52,146
He says coffee
must not grow this high.

258
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,325
Never mind, msabu.
He's a chief, but he's a Kikuyu.

259
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,945
If you put a dam here
to stop the water...

260
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,940
then I can make a pond here.

261
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,532
- Do you know how...
- This water must go home to Mombasa.

262
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,289
It can go home
after we make a pond.

263
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,290
Msabu, this water lives at Mombasa.

264
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,542
Come, then.

265
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,279
I wouldn't run.

266
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,619
If you do, she'll think
you're something good to eat.

267
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,412
Have you...
Do you have a gun?

268
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,213
She won't like
the smell of you.

269
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,710
Shoot it.

270
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,924
She's had breakfast.

271
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,461
Don't...

272
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:26,134
- Please, shoot her.
- No, let's give her a moment.

273
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,764
Oh, my God, shoot her!

274
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,450
Just how much closer
did you expect to let her come?

275
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,865
A bit.

276
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,740
She wanted to see if you'd run. That's
how they decide. A lot like people.

277
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,417
- She almost had me for lunch!
- It wasn't her fault. She's a lion.

278
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,505
- It wasn't mine.
- Doesn't that outfit come with a rifle?

279
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,675
It's on my saddle.

280
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,596
Better keep it with you.
Your horse isn't much of a shot.

281
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,173
For Berkeley.
He's brought you presents.

282
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,437
We stopped by your house
and them came looking for you.

283
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,094
Good Lord, you're sweet.

284
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,393
On the road, actually. We're off
to Magadi to shoot some ivory.

285
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:18,435
Now, at least, I have something good
to offer you.

286
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:22,030
Did you intend to tell Berkeley
what a fool I was?

287
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,985
- She had a lion a bit interested.
- A bit?

288
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,989
But not enough to bite.

289
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,371
It's all right to take a chance...

290
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,368
as long as it's you who'll pay.

291
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,462
- Wouldn't you say so?
- It's the sort of thing you'd say.

292
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,335
- Thank you.
- Not at all. Where's Blix?

293
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,261
- Hunting.
- Has he been out long?

294
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,543
Yes.

295
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,552
You'll need a good chat, then.
Shall we stay to supper, Denys?

296
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,556
- Blix will have jackets we could use.
- Do I have anything to say in this?

297
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:54,347
- Not really, but we'll hear you out.
- Then I would like you to stay.

298
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:57,359
Good. Denys.

299
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:00,315
I don't know. Do you sing?

300
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,315
Never.

301
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,985
Can you tell a story?

302
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,949
I happen to be
very good at stories.

303
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,956
I believe that.

304
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,917
What's happened to the cows, the dairy?

305
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:20,541
We changed our minds.
We'll grow coffee instead.

306
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,588
- A bit risky, this high.
- So I've been told.

307
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,344
- Didn't seem to bother you.
- I think they just haven't tried.

308
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,683
Every time I turn my back,
it wants to go wild again.

309
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,727
It will go wild.

310
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,647
- Your man...
- Kanuthia.

311
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,980
- He's not Kikuyu.
- No.

312
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,152
Shall I see
that he's given supper?

313
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,735
Don't do anything
for him, thank you, Baroness.

314
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,327
It's true of all Somalis. They're
the only tribe that knows horses.

315
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:58,831
They don't drink, charge interest
or chase other men's wives.

316
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,926
Got to go to town for that.

317
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,346
Did you know that
in all of literature...

318
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,103
there's no poem
celebrating the foot.

319
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:15,602
There's lips, eyes, hands, face...

320
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,397
hair, breasts...

321
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,641
legs, arms,
even the knees.

322
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,107
But not one verse
for the poor foot.

323
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:28,197
- Why do you think that is?
- Priorities, I suppose.

324
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,361
Did you think
you would make one?

325
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,363
Problem is there's nothing
to rhyme it with.

326
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,283
- Put.
- It's not a noun.

327
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,329
Doesn't matter.
Along he came and he did put...

328
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,827
upon my farm his clumsy foot.

329
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,008
We should have a story now.

330
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,387
When I tell a story
to my nieces at home...

331
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,017
one of them always provides
the first sentence.

332
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:03,271
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

333
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:11,449
There was a wandering Chinese
named Cheng Huan...

334
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,614
living in Limehouse...

335
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:20,292
and a girl named Shirley.

336
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,549
Who spoke perfect Chinese...

337
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,042
which she learned
from her missionary parents.

338
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:33,720
Cheng Huan lived alone
in a room on Formosa Street...

339
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,134
above the Blue Lantern.

340
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,437
He sat at his window...

341
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:46,561
and in his poor listening heart...

342
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,736
strange echoes
of his home and country...

343
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,972
They found them there
the next morning...

344
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,900
in their room
above the Blue Lantern...

345
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,392
the dead child
and the warlord...

346
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:31,525
with Cheng Huan's love gift
coiled about his neck.

347
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,829
Had you been to those places?

348
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,916
I have been a mental traveller.

349
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,163
- Till now.
- Yes.

350
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,293
Was this England?
Excuse me. Denmark?

351
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,086
I like my things.

352
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,181
When you travelled before
in your mind...

353
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:58,224
did you carry
so much luggage?

354
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,018
A mental traveller hasn't the need
to eat or sleep...

355
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,479
or entertain.

356
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,560
You're right.

357
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,982
Anyway, aren't you pleased
that I brought my crystal and china?

358
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,401
And your stories, yes.

359
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:21,204
The conquering heroes come

360
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:24,328
Sound the trumpets

361
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,875
Beat the drums

362
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:41,097
- I want you to come often.
- I'd like that very much.

363
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,188
- And you must promise it will be soon.
- I promise.

364
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,314
Did you save my life,
Finch Hatton?

365
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,405
No. The lioness did that.
She walked away.

366
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:04,618
So I'm not indebted, then?

367
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,999
Ah, but I am.

368
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,164
We pay our
storytellers here.

369
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,553
It's lovely.

370
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:19,921
But my stories are free...

371
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,389
and your present's
much too dear.

372
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:26,226
Write them down sometime.

373
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,732
Take care, Finch Hatton.

374
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,367
You wouldn't
rather call me Denys?

375
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,327
Baroness.

376
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,003
Goodbye.

377
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,203
What are you doing?

378
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,580
I want you to come home.

379
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,764
We never spoke
about children.

380
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,440
Did you...

381
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:58,486
Do you?

382
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:02,907
Yes. Is that all right?

383
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,547
These Kikuyu want to be sick now.

384
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,969
Good Lord.

385
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,769
Your leg has got worse.

386
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,815
You should go to hospital.

387
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,900
This leg may be foolish.

388
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,658
It may think
not to go to hospital.

389
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,193
This leg will
do as it pleases.

390
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,281
But if you will take it
to hospital...

391
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,829
I will think
that you are wise.

392
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:55,295
And such a wise man as this,
I would want to work in my house...

393
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,792
for wages.

394
00:36:56,882 --> 00:37:00,382
How much wages would come
to such a wise man as that?

395
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:06,967
More wages than come
from tending goats.

396
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,802
I will speak to this leg.

397
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,558
- What about air raids?
- Quiet! One question at a time.

398
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,853
The war is in Europe. How do we know
they're going to reach here?

399
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,693
German East is only 200 miles south.
General von Lettow is there.

400
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:05,070
I don't want to wait
until he joins us at the bar.

401
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,732
- Would we engage them?
- Blix, this is our war.

402
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:10,319
You don't have to be involved,
but thanks.

403
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:13,866
I've got crops coming in.
How long's this thing gonna last?

404
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,960
We just have to stay
and go as we must.

405
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,881
They won't fight
if we won't fight.

406
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,421
We could always arm the Masai
and point them south.

407
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,879
Do you want the job of collecting rifles
from the Masai when this is over?

408
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:29,257
What about our women and children?
Should we bring them into town?

409
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,719
We will deal with that problem
as it arises.

410
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:37,059
- Will they use native troops?
- I'd assume so, but not Masai.

411
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,058
Berkeley, what about your Somalis?

412
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:43,985
They'd make very good scouts. We could
cover the area from here to the border.

413
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,611
We could gather information
for when the regulars arrive.

414
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,907
What's it about?
Have you any idea?

415
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:53,409
- Not really.
- Then why do you want to get into it?

416
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,871
- Well...
- It's got nothing to do with us.

417
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,332
They've made agreements
we know nothing about.

418
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,330
Victoria and the Kaiser were
relatives, for God's sake.

419
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:07,672
They've divided Africa between them.
Do you know why there's a border?

420
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,720
Because she had two mountains,
and he had none.

421
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:12,476
So she gave him Kilimanjaro.

422
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,596
It's a silly argument
between two spoiled countries.

423
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:19,816
The sooner it ends, the sooner
we pick up where we left off.

424
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,028
It may end...

425
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:28,146
but we're not going to
pick up where we left off.

426
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:31,029
You don't have to go.

427
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,990
- You want to go.
- We've got to live here.

428
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,038
They have made it plain
they don't want you.

429
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,660
- I'll have to show them where we stand.
- I'm not so fond of their empire...

430
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,663
I'd have you shot for it.

431
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,425
More likely
chewed on than shot.

432
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:47,130
The farm will take care of itself,
and you've got Belknap.

433
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,339
The farm will not
take care of itself.

434
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,470
That's not the point.

435
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:59,350
I didn't expect
to like you so much.

436
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:07,231
You're not going to go
falling in love, are you?

437
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,983
Not with someone
who's always leaving.

438
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:18,958
If you need me,
send a runner to find Delamere.

439
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,119
That's where I'll be.

440
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,918
That's a fine kiss goodbye.

441
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,968
I am better at hello.

442
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,775
It's an odd feeling... farewell.

443
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,283
There is some envy in it.

444
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,581
Men go off to be tested
for courage.

445
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:02,533
If we're tested at all,
it's for patience...

446
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:05,380
for doing without...

447
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:09,794
for how well
we can endure loneliness.

448
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,423
But I had always known that.

449
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,429
It didn't require a war.

450
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:20,851
I said goodbye to Bror.

451
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:24,105
Denys left without a word...

452
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,935
which was quite proper.

453
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:30,897
Hello, the house!

454
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,943
Felicity!

455
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:38,404
I thought you might
want some meat.

456
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:42,162
- Is there any word?
- No, nothing new.

457
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,956
Not much fighting.
Awful fever, though.

458
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,669
I've got time for tea,
I should think.

459
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,763
Are you for the Germans?

460
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,846
Did they send you out
to ask me this?

461
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:07,558
- We had a row about it in town.
- Because of my bad English.

462
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,937
And whose side were you on?

463
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,072
Yours.

464
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:22,703
They want to send me home to school.
Mother says I'm growing up wild.

465
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,746
- I wanted to ask you about it.
- Me?

466
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:29,751
You've been round and about.

467
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,209
Someday, I'd like
to run my own show the way you do.

468
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:38,429
- Is that what I do?
- You don't seem to need us much.

469
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,058
Baroness, may I
ask you something?

470
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:49,065
I don't know much about men.

471
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:55,815
I want them to like me,
but I...

472
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:57,948
I want to be let alone too.

473
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:05,333
I'm supposed to want
to be taken, aren't I?

474
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,163
I've got this book.

475
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:15,796
But how do you know when to do
what they want you to...

476
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:18,923
and when not to?

477
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,725
I suppose you
ought to call me Karen.

478
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,413
They need paraffin and tinned food,
enough for 300 men.

479
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,037
He wants you to send a white man
with the wagon.

480
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:51,911
- Is he all right?
- Well enough to send the message.

481
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,254
And where would my husband
like this wagon sent?

482
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,213
He's with Delamere
on the border near Lake Natron.

483
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:00,296
That's confidential,
of course.

484
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:02,263
I will bear that
in mind, Lieutenant.

485
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:06,478
I only meant it wouldn't do
for it to be talk around Nairobi.

486
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:10,891
And we're going to have to move you
into town. We can't protect you here.

487
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:12,892
What do you mean?

488
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,903
With the men gone, we're worried about
the native element. We have orders.

489
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:18,028
Women and children into town.

490
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:20,357
That is internment, Lieutenant.

491
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:22,657
Women and children, Baroness.

492
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:27,743
- Is that one category or two?
- You'll want time to gather your things.

493
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,909
I'll send an escort
for you Thursday.

494
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:32,458
And I'm a captain, Baroness.

495
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,630
I'm not paid
to fight, Mrs Blixen.

496
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:47,682
Where is Lake Natron?

497
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,522
It's south, bush country.

498
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:52,682
It's no place
for a white man.

499
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:39,555
We should have crossed
the Sand River today.

500
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,106
I may have got us lost.

501
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:44,103
God is great, msabu.

502
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:41,913
- What the devil are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to Delamere.

503
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:44,162
Ridiculous.
We don't send women to war.

504
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:45,252
I'm going.

505
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:47,748
We haven't time for this.
You don't even know where you are.

506
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:49,385
I do now.

507
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,550
- You'll just get lost again.
- I'm going on.

508
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:56,761
- Talk to her, will you?
- No.

509
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:01,890
- She could be hurt or worse.
- I imagine she knows that.

510
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,477
Right. I tried.

511
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:12,529
Here.

512
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,620
Find a spot on the horizon
each morning and steer by it.

513
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:21,372
South, southwest.
About three days.

514
00:49:22,503 --> 00:49:24,045
I see.

515
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,667
Don't worry about us.
We'll be all right.

516
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:21,927
- What is it?
- Masai.

517
00:52:08,252 --> 00:52:11,835
Ismail! My rifle!
Where's my rifle?

518
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:40,527
Get away!

519
00:53:42,054 --> 00:53:45,589
Msabu's bleeding.
She does not have this ox.

520
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:50,389
This lion is hungry.

521
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:52,555
He does not have this ox.

522
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,391
This wagon is heavy.

523
00:53:56,485 --> 00:54:00,234
It doesn't have this ox.

524
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:02,445
God is happy, msabu.

525
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:04,572
He plays with us.

526
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:17,710
Tell Blix his wife's here.

527
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:08,798
I've brought you some things.

528
00:55:10,434 --> 00:55:12,343
You've changed your hair.

529
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:18,190
- You needed supplies.
- Send someone, I said.

530
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:20,185
You were lucky to get through.

531
00:55:20,277 --> 00:55:22,685
- It was really foolish.
- But I did get through.

532
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:26,818
And it was fun.

533
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,329
When are you coming home?

534
00:55:37,378 --> 00:55:38,576
Not just yet.

535
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:43,919
You're not going to help
at all with the farm.

536
00:55:48,514 --> 00:55:51,847
I could force you.
I could cut you off.

537
00:55:53,227 --> 00:55:55,979
I'll just hunt professionally.

538
00:55:57,648 --> 00:55:59,605
I might do it anyway.

539
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:06,270
It's not the way
we thought it would be.

540
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:10,118
Is it?

541
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,331
But I like it
that you're honest with me.

542
00:56:21,755 --> 00:56:23,665
I like you too.

543
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:33,558
Very much.

544
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:14,641
I had a compass from Denys.

545
00:57:14,725 --> 00:57:17,643
To steer by, he said.

546
00:57:17,728 --> 00:57:19,887
But later it came to me...

547
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,934
that we navigated differently.

548
00:57:25,152 --> 00:57:30,194
Perhaps he knew, as I did not...

549
00:57:30,282 --> 00:57:32,856
that the Earth was made round...

550
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:36,617
so that we would not see
too far down the road.

551
00:58:08,112 --> 00:58:10,021
You've got syphilis.

552
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:17,410
That's not possible.

553
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,908
Your husband is not ill?

554
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:32,009
Not the last time I saw him.

555
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:34,550
That was three months ago.
He's on the...

556
00:58:37,975 --> 00:58:41,011
He's on the border with Delamere.
He would have come home.

557
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:44,472
These cases vary.

558
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:46,474
He may have just a touch.

559
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:50,028
You're very ill.

560
00:58:59,288 --> 00:59:02,123
Is he the only possibility?

561
00:59:04,376 --> 00:59:06,416
Yes.

562
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:08,580
You'll have to go home
to deal with it.

563
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:13,802
The treatment's difficult,
but they have a thing called salvarsan.

564
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,883
Arsenic.

565
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,346
And if I'm not cured...

566
00:59:21,435 --> 00:59:24,602
then I will be insane, won't I?

567
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:26,646
You ought to go soon.

568
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:30,393
I'll have to see
your husband.

569
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,066
I will send for him.

570
00:59:36,158 --> 00:59:39,325
These ought to help with the fever
till you get home.

571
00:59:48,504 --> 00:59:50,876
And what are my chances?

572
00:59:50,965 --> 00:59:53,716
About even, I'm afraid.

573
01:00:03,602 --> 01:00:06,639
It's not what I thought would
happen to me now.

574
01:00:24,832 --> 01:00:27,157
- What?
- Your letters, msabu.

575
01:00:36,552 --> 01:00:38,545
Excuse me.

576
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:42,178
I heard you'd made it.

577
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:45,350
I'd have paid anything
to see their faces.

578
01:00:47,563 --> 01:00:49,721
- Would you join us for a drink?
- I can't.

579
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:51,808
How is it that you are home?

580
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:54,273
I brought Berkeley back.

581
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:56,568
- Has he been wounded?
- Fever.

582
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:59,775
More than usual, but he'll be all right
as long as the gin holds out.

583
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,445
And you?
How is it with the fighting?

584
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:08,204
We're taking a beating.

585
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:10,249
It's likely to last for a while.

586
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,464
- I still have your compass.
- Why don't you keep it?

587
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,040
You've earned it.

588
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:22,963
Besides, I don't always
want to know where I'm going.

589
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:31,604
Please don't
let me keep you.

590
01:01:35,277 --> 01:01:39,571
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Take good care.

591
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:44,909
- We're behind a story or two.
- Yes. When I get back.

592
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,573
Back? From where?

593
01:01:46,664 --> 01:01:49,119
When you get back, I meant.

594
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:54,712
- I thought it was malaria.
- Well, it wasn't.

595
01:01:57,133 --> 01:02:00,383
You may be all right,
but you have to be seen.

596
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:05,342
And the others,
whoever they are.

597
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:07,924
I hope they've got it.

598
01:02:08,018 --> 01:02:11,269
It's my fault. No one else's.

599
01:02:16,861 --> 01:02:18,236
I want to go with you.

600
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:21,777
No. Someone has to stay here
and run things.

601
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:24,107
And the factory
must be finished.

602
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:29,037
- Can you do that?
- That's little enough.

603
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:45,757
I'm sorry.

604
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:02,979
Where is memsahib?

605
01:03:04,408 --> 01:03:06,282
She can come soon enough.

606
01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:19,293
Later that day,
I left for Mombasa...

607
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:22,299
and the voyage home to Denmark.

608
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:26,711
It was a longer journey this time.

609
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:30,677
The war went on.

610
01:03:30,768 --> 01:03:34,053
I fought my own war.

611
01:03:34,146 --> 01:03:36,637
Arsenic was my ally...

612
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:39,057
against an enemy I never saw.

613
01:03:41,946 --> 01:03:45,943
I stayed in the room
where I was born...

614
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:47,942
in Rungstedland...

615
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:51,653
and tried to remember
the colours of Africa.

616
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:06,803
There was only the medicine...

617
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:08,796
and walks with my mother...

618
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:11,926
along a deserted stretch of beach...

619
01:04:12,017 --> 01:04:15,967
and this room in my mother's house.

620
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:22,059
Denmark had become
a stranger to me...

621
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:24,822
and I to her.

622
01:04:24,905 --> 01:04:28,440
But my mother's house
I came to know again.

623
01:04:29,452 --> 01:04:32,287
And knew I would
come back to it...

624
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:35,040
sick or well...

625
01:04:35,124 --> 01:04:38,742
sane or mad someday.

626
01:04:38,836 --> 01:04:41,541
And so I did...

627
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,588
after Tsavo.

628
01:05:35,684 --> 01:05:37,843
Almost everyone's
got them now.

629
01:06:51,385 --> 01:06:53,294
I am cooking now, memsahib.

630
01:06:53,387 --> 01:06:55,510
Yes, I have heard about this.

631
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:09,274
Are you well, Farah Aden?

632
01:07:10,488 --> 01:07:12,480
I am well enough, msabu.

633
01:07:13,282 --> 01:07:16,318
Then I am well enough also.

634
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:21,449
- What will you do?
- I have been thinking I'll hunt.

635
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,497
Safari sort of thing.

636
01:07:23,584 --> 01:07:27,368
They say it'll be quite a business
once the war is over.

637
01:07:27,463 --> 01:07:29,420
You wouldn't want to teach?

638
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,214
I would like these Kikuyu
to have a school.

639
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:36,845
There will be
a fight about that.

640
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:45,765
Are you all well?

641
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:49,315
They say I'm cured.

642
01:07:51,904 --> 01:07:54,027
I won't have children.

643
01:08:02,373 --> 01:08:04,247
Have you thought about us?

644
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:09,458
Of course.

645
01:08:20,224 --> 01:08:24,304
Belknap says the coffee will flower
after the next rains.

646
01:08:25,563 --> 01:08:27,057
If it does...

647
01:08:27,148 --> 01:08:31,145
you'll have start thinking about
hiring for the harvest...

648
01:08:31,235 --> 01:08:33,726
and how you'll get to market.

649
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:49,176
- Where would Berkeley be?
- He must be here.

650
01:10:00,866 --> 01:10:02,823
Who won the match?

651
01:10:10,793 --> 01:10:12,916
Have you got a story for me?

652
01:10:17,216 --> 01:10:20,751
I've been demoted.
I was Denys last time.

653
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:23,051
Would you care
for some champagne?

654
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:26,639
They said you
went home for a while.

655
01:10:28,018 --> 01:10:30,723
Yes. Where is Berkeley?

656
01:10:30,813 --> 01:10:32,936
It's good to see you.

657
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:38,728
He's still down with fever.
He'll be all right.

658
01:10:38,821 --> 01:10:40,730
Who are all these people?

659
01:10:42,491 --> 01:10:46,489
Bror says we'll be a colony soon.

660
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:48,904
Yes. They want it settled now.

661
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:52,449
There's a lottery.
Buy a ticket, win a farm in Africa.

662
01:10:52,543 --> 01:10:55,414
Did you really think it would
stay the way it was?

663
01:10:57,798 --> 01:10:59,838
I thought it might.

664
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:05,137
- Where is Kanuthia?
- He's dead.

665
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:15,105
How are you?
Would you join us for a drink?

666
01:11:16,984 --> 01:11:18,692
It's time to find a pillow.

667
01:11:19,904 --> 01:11:22,525
- Another night then?
- Yeah.

668
01:11:25,576 --> 01:11:27,485
Have a good Christmas.

669
01:11:29,163 --> 01:11:30,242
Christmas.

670
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:33,333
So it is.

671
01:12:04,615 --> 01:12:07,699
This Chief says
children higher than this...

672
01:12:07,785 --> 01:12:09,694
must not learn to read.

673
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:14,328
Tell him all the children
must go to school.

674
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:17,667
No. This is a chief.

675
01:12:17,753 --> 01:12:20,291
- You are not a chief.
- That's absurd.

676
01:12:20,381 --> 01:12:24,461
It's not good for tall people
to know more than this chief.

677
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:26,591
When these children are tall...

678
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:29,348
then this chief can be dead.

679
01:13:04,675 --> 01:13:08,424
Bror, yes. But Denys hired out
to tourists? I can't imagine.

680
01:13:08,512 --> 01:13:10,635
He's got no other trade.
Besides, we've got no choice.

681
01:13:10,723 --> 01:13:12,965
The government's
put a stop to the ivory.

682
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:16,593
- What will you do?
- I'll concentrate on the farm.

683
01:13:16,687 --> 01:13:17,850
Hello, the house!

684
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:21,058
Felicity!
How is it you're home?

685
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,226
I'm out. Look.

686
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:26,106
I didn't learn a thing,
but I'm wonderfully clean.

687
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:31,233
I'll come see you.
You save me a dance, Berkeley.

688
01:13:39,418 --> 01:13:41,909
What's this nonsense
I hear about a school?

689
01:13:42,004 --> 01:13:44,080
I've taken on
a young missionary.

690
01:13:44,173 --> 01:13:47,458
He's promised me to do the alphabet
first and save God for later.

691
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:49,544
Wogs can't even
count their goats.

692
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:53,764
- It's none of your business.
- Who the devil are you?

693
01:14:00,397 --> 01:14:03,102
I wonder if you'd
dance with me?

694
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:06,853
You are about to apologize.

695
01:14:10,491 --> 01:14:12,614
You do stir things up,
Baroness.

696
01:14:16,747 --> 01:14:19,285
When they said they liked to read,
how did they put that, exactly?

697
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:21,332
Do they know they'd like Dickens?

698
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:25,368
- You don't think they should learn?
- I think you might have asked them.

699
01:14:25,464 --> 01:14:28,002
Did you ask to learn
when you were a child?

700
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:30,250
How can stories
possibly harm them?

701
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:32,835
They have their own stories.
They're just not written down.

702
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,255
And what stake to you have
in keeping them ignorant?

703
01:14:35,349 --> 01:14:37,555
They're not ignorant.

704
01:14:37,643 --> 01:14:41,012
I just don't think they should be
turned into little Englishmen.

705
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:49,815
- You do like to change things.
- For the better, I hope.

706
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:54,658
I want my Kikuyu
to learn to read.

707
01:14:54,743 --> 01:14:58,575
"My Kikuyu." "My Limoges."
"My farm."

708
01:14:58,664 --> 01:14:59,743
It's a lot to own.

709
01:14:59,832 --> 01:15:02,121
I have paid a price
for everything I own.

710
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:04,001
What is it, exactly,
that's yours?

711
01:15:06,213 --> 01:15:08,835
We're not owners here.
We're just passing through.

712
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:14,462
Is life really
so damn simple for you?

713
01:15:14,555 --> 01:15:17,224
Perhaps I ask less
of it than you do.

714
01:15:18,768 --> 01:15:21,971
- I don't believe that.
- Happy new year!

715
01:15:25,983 --> 01:15:29,150
Should auld acquaintance
be forgot

716
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:34,741
And never brought to mind

717
01:15:34,825 --> 01:15:39,867
Should auld acquaintance
be forgot

718
01:15:39,955 --> 01:15:45,460
For the sake of auld lang syne

719
01:15:45,544 --> 01:15:50,502
For auld lang syne, my dear

720
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:55,502
For auld lang syne

721
01:15:55,596 --> 01:16:01,219
We'll drink a cup
of kindness here

722
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:06,268
For the sake
of auld lang syne

723
01:16:06,357 --> 01:16:10,224
We'll drink a cup

724
01:16:12,905 --> 01:16:15,028
God save...

725
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:19,065
Our gracious king

726
01:16:19,161 --> 01:16:24,915
Long live our noble king

727
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,208
God save our king

728
01:16:30,297 --> 01:16:36,051
Send him victorious

729
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:41,511
Happy and glorious

730
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,510
Happy new year, Karen.

731
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:47,474
And for you too.

732
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:53,437
God save the king

733
01:17:05,624 --> 01:17:08,828
Someone has left
her underclothes in the back.

734
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:18,589
I want you to take
a place in town.

735
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:26,186
Are you sure?

736
01:17:50,336 --> 01:17:51,285
Eat.

737
01:17:58,177 --> 01:17:59,755
Elephant.

738
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:28,740
Give me work.

739
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,704
We've got peace.
Where is the prosperity?

740
01:19:14,795 --> 01:19:18,211
Why should prices fall now just
because we're not killing anybody?

741
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:21,589
Well, tea's down just as bad.

742
01:19:24,263 --> 01:19:26,836
Do they always have
to whip them so?

743
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:58,370
Look. They finally made
a machine that's really useful.

744
01:19:58,464 --> 01:19:59,377
Listen.

745
01:20:04,053 --> 01:20:05,381
It's for you.

746
01:20:07,181 --> 01:20:10,265
- I can't accept it.
- Why not?

747
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:12,142
Bror's moved to town.

748
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:15,638
That's a private matter,
I imagine.

749
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:27,864
Did you think you
would spend the night?

750
01:20:27,952 --> 01:20:32,246
Can't, thanks.
I have to go down to the Mara.

751
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:37,162
I've taken up safari work,
and I've got to find a camp.

752
01:20:42,675 --> 01:20:45,082
There's country there
you ought to see.

753
01:20:45,177 --> 01:20:47,217
It won't last long now.

754
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:50,341
No. I would be
wasting your time.

755
01:20:51,642 --> 01:20:53,551
Why don't you get your things?

756
01:20:56,355 --> 01:20:59,226
If you like me at all...

757
01:20:59,316 --> 01:21:01,226
don't ask me to do this.

758
01:22:22,066 --> 01:22:23,264
What's your word?

759
01:22:26,278 --> 01:22:27,441
Shoo?

760
01:22:29,573 --> 01:22:31,530
Is that it? Shoo?

761
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:44,286
That's a fine word
you've got there, Baroness.

762
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,428
Crank it again, will you?

763
01:22:56,517 --> 01:22:59,138
Almost. Crank it again.

764
01:23:01,355 --> 01:23:02,434
Again.

765
01:23:07,778 --> 01:23:08,857
Once more.

766
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:17,825
Well done. We're off.

767
01:23:24,712 --> 01:23:26,586
I don't know
the scientific basis for it...

768
01:23:26,672 --> 01:23:30,586
but I know you can see further in the
African night than any other place.

769
01:23:34,346 --> 01:23:36,304
And the stars are brighter.

770
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:43,559
It's about the tents.

771
01:23:43,647 --> 01:23:45,474
When I'm out with Kanuthia...

772
01:23:47,276 --> 01:23:50,360
it used to be
we didn't use them.

773
01:23:51,655 --> 01:23:54,941
I remember him.

774
01:23:55,034 --> 01:23:56,362
There was something...

775
01:23:56,452 --> 01:23:58,694
Masai.

776
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:01,742
He was half Masai.
That's what you remember about him.

777
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:03,706
They're like nobody else.

778
01:24:05,336 --> 01:24:08,372
We think we'll tame them...

779
01:24:08,464 --> 01:24:10,670
but we won't.

780
01:24:10,758 --> 01:24:12,715
If you put them in prison,
they die.

781
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:16,881
- Why?
- Because they live now.

782
01:24:16,972 --> 01:24:18,882
They don't think
about the future.

783
01:24:20,684 --> 01:24:24,634
They can't grasp the idea
that they'll be let out one day.

784
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:26,972
They think it's permanent.

785
01:24:27,066 --> 01:24:28,441
So they die.

786
01:24:31,445 --> 01:24:33,936
They're the only ones out here
that don't care about us...

787
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:36,356
and that is what
will finish them.

788
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,907
What did the two of you
ever find to talk about?

789
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:45,372
Nothing.

790
01:24:50,506 --> 01:24:54,124
So. You knew I would come.

791
01:25:02,059 --> 01:25:05,808
It's an early day tomorrow.
Why don't you get some sleep?

792
01:25:08,107 --> 01:25:10,942
- And what happens tomorrow?
- I have no idea.

793
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:18,948
- Good night.
- Good night.

794
01:25:58,115 --> 01:26:01,152
You would think
they would run off.

795
01:26:01,243 --> 01:26:02,406
You didn't.

796
01:26:32,191 --> 01:26:33,934
Think of that.

797
01:26:34,026 --> 01:26:36,149
Never a man-made sound,
and then Mozart.

798
01:27:09,478 --> 01:27:12,016
- Have you clients already?
- In a week.

799
01:27:12,106 --> 01:27:14,431
A man from Belgium
and his daughters.

800
01:27:14,525 --> 01:27:17,645
His letter said,
"We'd like three of everything."

801
01:27:17,736 --> 01:27:20,903
It'll be an interesting trip.
I'll be gone a month...

802
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:23,777
or an hour and a half.

803
01:27:23,868 --> 01:27:27,034
Why are you doing this?

804
01:27:27,121 --> 01:27:29,078
I don't know how to sew.

805
01:27:46,682 --> 01:27:49,255
Do you know what they're
made of? Cloth.

806
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:51,178
Where will he land?

807
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:53,227
Trick is not to.

808
01:27:57,401 --> 01:27:59,477
It must feel amazing.

809
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:06,910
It's how I imagined
America to be.

810
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,655
- Have you been to America?
- No, but my father was there.

811
01:28:11,749 --> 01:28:14,703
He told me stories about it
when I was a little girl.

812
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,580
- Are you still close?
- He died.

813
01:28:18,672 --> 01:28:22,373
He killed himself
when I was ten years old.

814
01:28:45,866 --> 01:28:47,823
I can fix that, I think.

815
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:49,903
"Laughed loud and long...

816
01:28:49,995 --> 01:28:54,207
and all the while
his eyes went to and fro.

817
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:58,834
'Ha ha,' quoth he,
'full plain I see.

818
01:28:58,921 --> 01:29:01,957
The devil knows how to row.'

819
01:29:04,093 --> 01:29:06,963
- Farewell, farewell..."
- You're skipping verses.

820
01:29:07,054 --> 01:29:09,462
I leave out the dull parts.

821
01:29:09,557 --> 01:29:11,596
"Farewell, farewell...

822
01:29:11,684 --> 01:29:14,638
but this I tell to thee,
thou wedding guest."

823
01:29:14,728 --> 01:29:17,516
Lay your head back.

824
01:29:17,606 --> 01:29:19,398
"He prayeth well...

825
01:29:19,483 --> 01:29:23,861
who loveth well
both man and bird...

826
01:29:23,946 --> 01:29:25,903
and beast."

827
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:38,700
That's better.

828
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:43,371
Will it be so different,
hunting for hire?

829
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:47,592
Not for the animals.
Well, maybe for the animals.

830
01:29:47,678 --> 01:29:51,213
Do you really prefer them
to people?

831
01:29:51,307 --> 01:29:52,552
Sometimes.

832
01:29:53,392 --> 01:29:55,717
They don't do anything
half-heartedly.

833
01:29:55,811 --> 01:29:57,887
Everything's for the first time...

834
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:01,349
Hunting, working, mating.

835
01:30:01,442 --> 01:30:03,684
It's only man
that does it badly.

836
01:30:03,778 --> 01:30:07,478
It's only man that tires
of going through it.

837
01:30:07,573 --> 01:30:11,950
Who says, "See here.
Now I know how you feel about me...

838
01:30:12,036 --> 01:30:16,247
and you know how
I feel about you...

839
01:30:16,332 --> 01:30:21,326
and we understand each other,
so let's lie down and get on with it."

840
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:31,880
Why am I here?

841
01:30:34,767 --> 01:30:36,843
Because I wanted you
to see all this.

842
01:30:40,314 --> 01:30:43,398
I wanted to show it to you.

843
01:30:43,484 --> 01:30:45,393
I thought you'd
understand it.

844
01:30:50,616 --> 01:30:52,692
Do you think much
about death?

845
01:30:52,785 --> 01:30:54,694
I think about getting old.

846
01:30:57,623 --> 01:31:00,375
Be like living with a cranky,
demanding old bastard.

847
01:31:02,253 --> 01:31:05,622
Well, you are a cranky,
demanding old bastard.

848
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,589
I had syphilis.

849
01:31:20,729 --> 01:31:22,639
That's why I went home.

850
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,402
I know.

851
01:31:30,197 --> 01:31:32,605
I never seem to get anything.

852
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,739
German measles once.

853
01:31:38,622 --> 01:31:42,869
They say I'll have
a normal life now...

854
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,083
but no children.

855
01:31:47,381 --> 01:31:49,338
So, the school?

856
01:31:53,095 --> 01:31:56,215
So, the school.

857
01:31:56,307 --> 01:31:58,714
The farm.
That's what I am now.

858
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:15,238
We'll need meat
for the camp tomorrow.

859
01:32:15,326 --> 01:32:17,069
I'll wake you at dawn.

860
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:26,117
Good night.

861
01:32:27,546 --> 01:32:28,744
Good night.

862
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:44,973
We might scare up gazelles, but we'll
be going through buffalo country again.

863
01:32:45,064 --> 01:32:47,140
They get cocky
when you're on foot.

864
01:34:08,105 --> 01:34:09,184
Supper.

865
01:34:10,566 --> 01:34:12,475
Good size, but...

866
01:34:22,578 --> 01:34:23,491
Lion.

867
01:34:26,207 --> 01:34:28,330
Careful, the wind's behind us.

868
01:35:29,478 --> 01:35:30,557
Back up.

869
01:35:30,646 --> 01:35:31,844
Slowly.

870
01:35:46,245 --> 01:35:49,412
If there's a charge,
drop flat...

871
01:35:49,498 --> 01:35:51,407
and let me do it.

872
01:36:33,834 --> 01:36:34,997
Reload!

873
01:37:13,666 --> 01:37:15,789
Dinner in a while?

874
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:19,627
I'm glad you came.

875
01:38:49,386 --> 01:38:50,845
To rose-lipped maidens.

876
01:39:00,106 --> 01:39:04,103
There was a very young girl
from Denmark...

877
01:39:04,193 --> 01:39:07,941
who took passage on a steamer
bound for Suez.

878
01:39:10,574 --> 01:39:12,531
There was a storm...

879
01:39:14,036 --> 01:39:15,365
off Morocco...

880
01:39:18,707 --> 01:39:21,661
and she was washed ashore...

881
01:39:21,752 --> 01:39:23,661
onto a beach.

882
01:39:28,676 --> 01:39:30,668
Onto a white beach.

883
01:39:40,187 --> 01:39:43,188
Onto a beach so,
so white...

884
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:25,933
I'd like to do that.

885
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:40,990
- Will that hurt?
- No.

886
01:40:49,548 --> 01:40:53,842
If you say anything now,
I'll believe it.

887
01:41:18,744 --> 01:41:21,200
I need to know
how to think about this.

888
01:41:23,791 --> 01:41:25,333
Why?

889
01:42:02,746 --> 01:42:05,997
Your clear soup,
the new lettuce...

890
01:42:06,083 --> 01:42:08,159
chicken, just the breast.

891
01:42:10,963 --> 01:42:13,169
I trust this meets
with your approval?

892
01:42:13,257 --> 01:42:16,092
- Who is coming?
- Bwana Cole is coming.

893
01:42:16,177 --> 01:42:18,465
I will think on Bwana Cole.

894
01:42:28,022 --> 01:42:30,939
I've got myself
in real trouble now.

895
01:42:31,025 --> 01:42:33,267
- Now you think they should vote?
- No, worse.

896
01:42:50,169 --> 01:42:51,414
Get Kamante.

897
01:42:53,464 --> 01:42:55,622
He is out of hand entirely.

898
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:05,098
Does this look
like a chicken?

899
01:43:08,145 --> 01:43:11,597
Here is not a chicken, memsahib.
Here is a fish.

900
01:43:13,692 --> 01:43:15,068
Go away.

901
01:43:20,991 --> 01:43:22,699
What do you think?

902
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:26,278
It's quite good, isn't it?

903
01:43:28,582 --> 01:43:29,911
Be careful.

904
01:43:34,213 --> 01:43:36,834
When the old map makers got to the edge
of the world, they used to write...

905
01:43:36,924 --> 01:43:39,380
"Beyond this place
there be dragons."

906
01:43:40,761 --> 01:43:42,718
Is that where I am?

907
01:43:45,182 --> 01:43:47,852
He likes to give presents...

908
01:43:47,935 --> 01:43:49,560
but not at Christmas.

909
01:43:51,856 --> 01:43:55,438
He hasn't even said
when he's coming again.

910
01:43:55,526 --> 01:43:57,565
If he's coming again.

911
01:43:59,363 --> 01:44:00,561
Would you divorce?

912
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:04,407
Then I would have no one.

913
01:45:19,527 --> 01:45:21,934
Men who missed
moose in Alaska...

914
01:45:22,029 --> 01:45:24,650
grizzly in America,
tiger in India...

915
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:26,780
are all at sea now,
bound for here.

916
01:45:29,286 --> 01:45:31,659
Berkeley is going to farm.

917
01:45:31,747 --> 01:45:34,036
You could do that.

918
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:37,209
No, thank you.

919
01:45:37,294 --> 01:45:39,964
You ought to look
in on him, though.

920
01:45:40,047 --> 01:45:41,956
He didn't look
all that well.

921
01:45:49,974 --> 01:45:51,883
Can you stay?

922
01:45:55,896 --> 01:45:59,265
For a day or so.

923
01:45:59,358 --> 01:46:01,398
- Is that all right?
- No.

924
01:46:05,322 --> 01:46:07,362
You don't need
two guns on safari.

925
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:09,738
Then do the town work.

926
01:46:09,827 --> 01:46:13,278
Meet the clients,
do outfitting, there's mail.

927
01:46:13,372 --> 01:46:15,780
I don't know that
I'd be right for that.

928
01:46:15,875 --> 01:46:18,959
You've got to do something.

929
01:46:19,044 --> 01:46:21,452
I don't, actually.

930
01:46:21,547 --> 01:46:23,586
My water's gone black.

931
01:46:29,638 --> 01:46:32,509
We've got to get you to a hospital
and get you some proper care.

932
01:46:35,603 --> 01:46:37,809
I'm being cared for properly.

933
01:46:48,949 --> 01:46:50,325
It's...

934
01:46:52,536 --> 01:46:55,241
some years now.

935
01:46:55,331 --> 01:46:57,240
She's fond of me,
I think.

936
01:47:00,795 --> 01:47:03,464
Why didn't you tell me?

937
01:47:04,757 --> 01:47:06,999
I suppose...

938
01:47:07,093 --> 01:47:08,337
I thought...

939
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:13,256
I didn't know you
well enough.

940
01:47:17,645 --> 01:47:19,554
There's money left
in the trading account.

941
01:47:19,647 --> 01:47:23,265
I'd like my share
to go to Mairiamo.

942
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:25,316
Listen.

943
01:47:25,402 --> 01:47:28,818
George Martin had black water fever,
and that was five years now.

944
01:47:29,949 --> 01:47:32,522
You might take along
that 12-bore you're so fond of.

945
01:47:32,618 --> 01:47:34,658
The trigger seems a bit...

946
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:37,786
Get Karen to try the Rigby.

947
01:47:37,873 --> 01:47:40,162
It's a nice-size gun for her.

948
01:47:50,136 --> 01:47:51,464
Would you like...

949
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:56,506
Would you like me
to take you home?

950
01:47:58,185 --> 01:48:00,855
I am home, I suppose.

951
01:48:00,938 --> 01:48:02,646
- "F."
- "F."

952
01:48:04,358 --> 01:48:06,066
- "G."
- "G."

953
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:09,396
"G" for girl.

954
01:48:14,827 --> 01:48:17,400
Are you packed?

955
01:48:17,496 --> 01:48:19,405
Yes.

956
01:48:19,498 --> 01:48:20,909
How was town?

957
01:48:22,168 --> 01:48:23,282
Crowded.

958
01:48:28,507 --> 01:48:29,918
I've been thinking.

959
01:48:31,844 --> 01:48:35,427
With all the safari work,
I have little use for the room...

960
01:48:35,514 --> 01:48:36,973
at the club.

961
01:48:42,855 --> 01:48:46,271
I don't know
that I'd be any good at this...

962
01:48:47,526 --> 01:48:51,654
but how would it be if I kept
a few things with you?

963
01:48:58,037 --> 01:49:00,279
You would come and go
from my house?

964
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:04,330
If that's all right.

965
01:49:06,128 --> 01:49:09,628
When the gods want to punish you,
they answer your prayers.

966
01:49:19,809 --> 01:49:20,888
Berkeley's dying.

967
01:49:24,021 --> 01:49:26,097
- What?
- Black water fever.

968
01:49:27,191 --> 01:49:28,602
Oh, my God.

969
01:49:30,027 --> 01:49:33,230
- I'll go to him.
- No, he wouldn't want you there.

970
01:49:33,322 --> 01:49:34,271
Why?

971
01:49:36,867 --> 01:49:40,070
There's a woman there.
She's Somali.

972
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,117
She's been with him
for some time.

973
01:49:45,292 --> 01:49:47,202
You never told me this.

974
01:49:50,005 --> 01:49:51,464
I didn't know.

975
01:50:10,359 --> 01:50:14,571
"...with each one of us now
and forevermore." Amen.

976
01:50:36,552 --> 01:50:38,841
Strange that Denys isn't here.

977
01:50:41,098 --> 01:50:43,007
I think he is off with Berkeley.

978
01:50:53,235 --> 01:50:57,150
In the days and hours
that Denys was at home...

979
01:50:57,239 --> 01:50:59,861
we spoke of nothing ordinary.

980
01:51:01,076 --> 01:51:04,280
Not of my troubles
with the farm...

981
01:51:04,371 --> 01:51:08,120
my notes due
and my failing crop...

982
01:51:08,209 --> 01:51:10,534
or of his, with his work...

983
01:51:10,628 --> 01:51:14,044
what he knew was happening
to Africa.

984
01:51:16,634 --> 01:51:22,423
Or of anything at all
that was small and real.

985
01:51:22,515 --> 01:51:26,299
We lived disconnected...

986
01:51:26,393 --> 01:51:29,347
and apart from things.

987
01:51:30,397 --> 01:51:34,146
I had been making up stories
while he was away.

988
01:51:34,235 --> 01:51:38,149
In the evenings,
he made himself comfortable...

989
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:42,651
spreading cushions like a couch
in front of the fire.

990
01:51:42,743 --> 01:51:47,489
And with me sitting cross-legged
like Shahrazade herself...

991
01:51:47,581 --> 01:51:52,539
he would listen, clear eyed,
to a long tale...

992
01:51:53,587 --> 01:51:57,003
from when it began
until it ended.

993
01:52:38,883 --> 01:52:40,626
Where did you get it?

994
01:52:40,718 --> 01:52:42,794
Mombasa.

995
01:52:42,887 --> 01:52:44,963
Get in.

996
01:52:49,894 --> 01:52:52,467
When did you learn to fly?

997
01:52:52,563 --> 01:52:54,022
Yesterday.

998
01:55:59,917 --> 01:56:01,328
Don't move.

999
01:56:08,175 --> 01:56:10,084
I want to move.

1000
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:13,096
Don't move.

1001
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:46,664
Tanne, may I see you?

1002
01:56:54,638 --> 01:56:55,967
Well, I'm broke too, you know?

1003
01:56:56,056 --> 01:56:59,722
I wouldn't ask,
but tips were a bit light.

1004
01:57:03,355 --> 01:57:06,890
- Are you all right?
- If I get a decent crop.

1005
01:57:09,069 --> 01:57:11,027
I could shoot him.

1006
01:57:15,034 --> 01:57:18,901
I've got this terrible urge
to kiss you.

1007
01:57:21,624 --> 01:57:23,451
He is smarter than I am.

1008
01:57:23,542 --> 01:57:25,451
It may go well.

1009
01:57:27,463 --> 01:57:29,372
Good luck, Tanne.

1010
01:57:41,852 --> 01:57:43,430
You might have asked.

1011
01:57:43,521 --> 01:57:44,931
I did.

1012
01:57:46,524 --> 01:57:48,148
She said yes.

1013
01:58:02,081 --> 01:58:05,366
If I get eaten up some time,
bury me here, will you?

1014
01:58:05,459 --> 01:58:07,915
Whatever's left.

1015
01:58:08,003 --> 01:58:11,004
Just there,
at the crest of the hill.

1016
01:58:16,846 --> 01:58:18,922
When are you leaving?

1017
01:58:19,014 --> 01:58:20,473
Tomorrow.

1018
01:58:22,184 --> 01:58:25,304
Doesn't it matter to you
that I'm another man's wife?

1019
01:58:26,689 --> 01:58:29,939
What matters to me
is that you tried so hard.

1020
01:58:32,695 --> 01:58:34,771
What time tomorrow?

1021
01:58:44,874 --> 01:58:46,534
Goodbye again.

1022
01:58:47,626 --> 01:58:49,334
How many acres under cultivation?

1023
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:52,623
- Five hundred.
- The rest of it's wild?

1024
01:58:52,715 --> 01:58:56,629
- Well, the Kikuyu live there.
- Why don't you move them off?

1025
01:58:57,887 --> 01:59:00,460
'Cause they live there.

1026
01:59:00,556 --> 01:59:03,225
We'll take it over
should you default.

1027
01:59:06,353 --> 01:59:09,058
- We've got another year.
- God is great, msabu.

1028
01:59:09,148 --> 01:59:11,105
He's charging three percent.

1029
01:59:22,203 --> 01:59:24,112
This chief says...

1030
01:59:24,205 --> 01:59:26,874
tall children can come
to school now.

1031
01:59:35,174 --> 01:59:40,132
Tell Chief Kinanjui
that reading is a valuable thing.

1032
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:43,753
His children
will remember him well.

1033
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:03,818
This chief says, "British can read,
and what good has it done them?"

1034
02:01:34,627 --> 02:01:37,248
Miss Felicity Spurway,
clear round.

1035
02:01:37,338 --> 02:01:39,330
She's quite something,
that Felicity.

1036
02:01:39,423 --> 02:01:40,882
Yes, indeed.

1037
02:01:43,594 --> 02:01:48,837
The next competitor,
Mr John Sutton on Castano.

1038
02:01:50,768 --> 02:01:52,642
How are you?

1039
02:01:52,728 --> 02:01:54,685
Getting old, I think.

1040
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:58,016
Not you.

1041
02:01:58,109 --> 02:01:59,686
How is the hunt?

1042
02:01:59,777 --> 02:02:02,066
I'll make a living.
Where is Denys?

1043
02:02:03,405 --> 02:02:07,818
Uganda. Some potentate.

1044
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:11,824
I thought you might
be wanting a divorce.

1045
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:18,833
Has she got money?

1046
02:02:18,921 --> 02:02:20,830
Of course she's got money.

1047
02:02:22,758 --> 02:02:24,336
Is this important

1048
02:02:25,386 --> 02:02:26,761
I suppose.

1049
02:02:28,222 --> 02:02:30,795
Well, I'll have to accuse you
of something.

1050
02:02:32,393 --> 02:02:35,228
Or did you think you would have it
the other way around?

1051
02:02:36,730 --> 02:02:38,640
Fire away. Whatever.

1052
02:02:38,732 --> 02:02:40,642
I have surely done it.

1053
02:02:44,071 --> 02:02:45,731
Thank you, Tanne.

1054
02:02:45,823 --> 02:02:50,070
How do you manage it...
to keep us friends?

1055
02:02:50,161 --> 02:02:52,912
We started that way.

1056
02:02:55,749 --> 02:02:59,035
Well, I'll be happy for you,
if I can.

1057
02:03:07,011 --> 02:03:08,968
I remember that quite well.

1058
02:03:33,245 --> 02:03:35,653
When you go away on safari...

1059
02:03:35,748 --> 02:03:38,155
are you ever with someone else?

1060
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:40,492
I'd be with you
if I wanted to be with anyone.

1061
02:03:43,214 --> 02:03:45,965
- Do you ever get lonely?
- Sometimes.

1062
02:03:46,759 --> 02:03:48,798
Do you ever wonder
if I am lonely?

1063
02:03:50,596 --> 02:03:52,256
No, I don't.

1064
02:03:53,265 --> 02:03:55,258
Do you think about me at all?

1065
02:03:56,435 --> 02:04:00,267
- Often.
- But not enough to come back.

1066
02:04:01,899 --> 02:04:04,604
I do come back... all the time.
What is it?

1067
02:04:06,362 --> 02:04:07,986
Nothing.

1068
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:18,950
Bror has asked me for a divorce.
He found someone that he wants to marry.

1069
02:04:19,041 --> 02:04:21,283
I just thought
we might do that someday.

1070
02:04:22,545 --> 02:04:23,825
Divorce?

1071
02:04:27,174 --> 02:04:30,626
How... How would a wedding
change things?

1072
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:34,294
I would have someone of my own.

1073
02:04:36,559 --> 02:04:37,969
You wouldn't.

1074
02:04:39,854 --> 02:04:41,893
What's wrong with marriage, anyway?

1075
02:04:41,981 --> 02:04:44,020
Have you ever seen one
you admire?

1076
02:04:44,108 --> 02:04:45,982
Yes, I have. Many.

1077
02:04:49,447 --> 02:04:51,653
Belfields, for one.

1078
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:54,658
He sent her home
for the rains in 1910.

1079
02:04:54,743 --> 02:04:56,866
Didn't tell her they were over
till 1913.

1080
02:04:56,954 --> 02:04:59,326
It's not a joke. People marry.
It's not revolutionary.

1081
02:04:59,415 --> 02:05:02,618
- There are animals that mate for life.
- Geese.

1082
02:05:02,710 --> 02:05:05,794
You use the damn animals
for your own argument.

1083
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:07,706
You won't let me use them for mine.

1084
02:05:09,049 --> 02:05:11,375
I'd mate for life.

1085
02:05:12,553 --> 02:05:14,344
One day at a time.

1086
02:05:15,556 --> 02:05:20,930
I'd just like someone
to ask me once, that's all.

1087
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:24,471
Promise me you'll do that,
if I promise to say no?

1088
02:05:24,565 --> 02:05:27,186
Just trust you, eh?

1089
02:05:32,072 --> 02:05:33,946
When you go away...

1090
02:05:35,409 --> 02:05:37,616
you don't always go
on safari, do you?

1091
02:05:44,543 --> 02:05:46,785
Just want to be away.

1092
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:50,039
It's not meant to hurt you.

1093
02:05:52,093 --> 02:05:53,919
It does.

1094
02:05:55,387 --> 02:05:57,878
I'm with you because
I choose to be with you.

1095
02:05:57,973 --> 02:06:01,307
I don't want to live
someone else's idea of how to live.

1096
02:06:01,393 --> 02:06:03,766
Don't ask me to do that.

1097
02:06:03,854 --> 02:06:07,852
I don't want to find out one day that
I'm at the end of someone else's life.

1098
02:06:10,027 --> 02:06:12,269
I'm willing to pay for mine.
To be lonely sometimes.

1099
02:06:12,363 --> 02:06:14,854
To die alone, if I have to.
I think that's fair.

1100
02:06:14,949 --> 02:06:17,985
Not quite.
You want me to pay for it as well.

1101
02:06:18,077 --> 02:06:21,612
No, you have a choice, and you're
not willing to do the same for me.

1102
02:06:25,209 --> 02:06:28,126
I won't be closer to you...

1103
02:06:28,212 --> 02:06:30,833
and I won't love you more
because of a piece of paper.

1104
02:06:45,062 --> 02:06:46,722
See if you can shore it up.

1105
02:06:57,741 --> 02:06:58,690
Move away.

1106
02:07:01,912 --> 02:07:04,403
Let it go.

1107
02:07:06,041 --> 02:07:08,615
This water lives in Mombasa anyway.

1108
02:07:54,465 --> 02:07:56,374
I flew as far as Narok.

1109
02:07:56,467 --> 02:07:59,966
You could see all the ruts
where the lorries had been.

1110
02:08:00,054 --> 02:08:01,963
The Serengeti was still good.

1111
02:08:02,056 --> 02:08:03,965
Take a week just getting there.

1112
02:08:09,522 --> 02:08:12,273
And Samburu is still good.

1113
02:08:12,358 --> 02:08:14,434
Where's Belknap?
I haven't seen him.

1114
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:19,903
He must be in America by now.

1115
02:08:23,702 --> 02:08:25,612
I let him go.

1116
02:08:27,206 --> 02:08:30,409
I had to. But you don't want
to hear about the farm, do you?

1117
02:08:30,501 --> 02:08:34,084
- L... Have you got any buttons?
- What are you doing?

1118
02:08:35,714 --> 02:08:37,125
- Mending your shirt.
- Don't.

1119
02:08:38,175 --> 02:08:39,800
Don't do that.

1120
02:08:39,885 --> 02:08:41,130
You don't have to do that.

1121
02:08:50,396 --> 02:08:52,472
Maybe I'll try Samburu
day after tomorrow.

1122
02:08:52,565 --> 02:08:54,308
You just got back.

1123
02:08:58,696 --> 02:09:01,531
You know,
Felicity asked to come along...

1124
02:09:03,367 --> 02:09:06,285
and I almost said no
because I thought you wouldn't like it.

1125
02:09:06,370 --> 02:09:09,454
- There's no reason for her not to come.
- Yes, there is. I wouldn't like it.

1126
02:09:10,207 --> 02:09:11,749
You want her along?

1127
02:09:11,834 --> 02:09:13,910
I want things that don't matter
not to matter.

1128
02:09:14,003 --> 02:09:16,754
- Then tell her no. Do it for me.
- And then? What else would it be?

1129
02:09:16,839 --> 02:09:18,796
Why is your freedom
more important that mine?

1130
02:09:18,883 --> 02:09:21,421
It isn't. And I've never interfered
with your freedom.

1131
02:09:21,510 --> 02:09:23,586
No. I'm not allowed to need you.

1132
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:25,921
Or rely on you,
or expect anything from you.

1133
02:09:26,015 --> 02:09:27,924
I'm free to leave.

1134
02:09:29,185 --> 02:09:31,094
- But I do need you.
- You don't need me.

1135
02:09:31,187 --> 02:09:33,428
If I die, will you die?
You don't need me.

1136
02:09:33,522 --> 02:09:36,440
You're confused. You've mixed up
need with want. You always have.

1137
02:09:36,525 --> 02:09:39,562
My God. In the world that you would
make, there would be no love at all.

1138
02:09:39,653 --> 02:09:41,895
Or the best kind.
The kind we wouldn't have to prove.

1139
02:09:41,989 --> 02:09:44,776
- You'll be living on the moon then.
- Why? Because I won't do it your way?

1140
02:09:44,867 --> 02:09:47,784
Are we assuming there's one proper way
to do all this?

1141
02:09:47,870 --> 02:09:49,613
Do you think I care about Felicity?

1142
02:09:49,705 --> 02:09:51,614
Do you think
I'll be involved with her?

1143
02:09:57,129 --> 02:09:59,122
- Then there's no reason for this.
- If she's not important...

1144
02:09:59,215 --> 02:10:01,041
why won't you give it up?

1145
02:10:03,928 --> 02:10:06,501
I have learned a thing
that you haven't.

1146
02:10:07,723 --> 02:10:09,965
There are some things worth having...

1147
02:10:11,227 --> 02:10:14,809
but they come at a price,
and I want to be one of them.

1148
02:10:17,399 --> 02:10:19,024
I won't allow it.

1149
02:10:21,737 --> 02:10:24,738
You have no idea the effect
that language has on me.

1150
02:10:24,824 --> 02:10:27,659
I used to think that there was nothing
that you really wanted...

1151
02:10:27,743 --> 02:10:29,985
but that's not it, is it?

1152
02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:32,748
You want to have it all.

1153
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:40,162
I'm going to Samburu.
She can come or not.

1154
02:10:47,596 --> 02:10:49,554
Then you will be living elsewhere.

1155
02:10:56,772 --> 02:10:58,053
All right.

1156
02:11:38,063 --> 02:11:40,021
Is that a prince in there?

1157
02:11:57,958 --> 02:12:01,043
I think that you had better get up,
memsahib.

1158
02:12:01,128 --> 02:12:03,798
- What?
- I think that you had better get up.

1159
02:12:03,881 --> 02:12:05,838
I think that God is coming.

1160
02:13:01,605 --> 02:13:03,016
All gone.

1161
02:13:20,875 --> 02:13:24,291
- How did it start?
- I think God had a hand in it.

1162
02:13:24,378 --> 02:13:28,292
He gave me my best crop ever,
and then He remembered.

1163
02:13:28,382 --> 02:13:30,956
- Insurance?
- That's for pessimists.

1164
02:13:31,761 --> 02:13:33,670
Where is Denys?

1165
02:13:33,763 --> 02:13:35,138
Who knows?

1166
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:40,351
Doesn't matter.
The baroness is broke, "D."

1167
02:13:42,229 --> 02:13:43,688
It's over.

1168
02:13:43,773 --> 02:13:47,817
I've got to find some land
before I go, for my Kikuyu.

1169
02:13:47,902 --> 02:13:49,360
You've trouble enough, Karen.

1170
02:13:49,445 --> 02:13:52,529
Just a chunk somewhere,
so they can stay all together.

1171
02:13:55,451 --> 02:13:57,823
We're just out of coffee...

1172
02:13:57,912 --> 02:13:59,869
but I can give you tea.

1173
02:14:00,998 --> 02:14:04,782
There is no arable land that size
outside the reserve...

1174
02:14:04,877 --> 02:14:06,916
and if there were,
we'd not put natives on it.

1175
02:14:07,004 --> 02:14:10,918
- Since it's theirs.
- It belongs to the crown, Baroness.

1176
02:14:11,008 --> 02:14:12,965
What you want is quite impossible.

1177
02:14:13,052 --> 02:14:16,421
Yes, it always is.
Who must I see next?

1178
02:14:16,514 --> 02:14:19,218
You've run through us all,
I'm afraid.

1179
02:14:19,308 --> 02:14:21,301
We have a new governor,
haven't we?

1180
02:14:21,393 --> 02:14:24,928
Sir Joseph?
He hasn't arrived yet.

1181
02:14:25,022 --> 02:14:27,976
But will soon, I'm told.

1182
02:14:28,067 --> 02:14:30,225
You do still ask me to things?

1183
02:14:30,319 --> 02:14:33,154
Captain Jacques Llewllyn.

1184
02:14:33,239 --> 02:14:35,148
- Your servant, sir.
- Mr Llewllyn.

1185
02:14:36,408 --> 02:14:39,244
The honourable Hugh Chomondeley,
Lord Delamere.

1186
02:14:39,328 --> 02:14:42,115
- Your servant, sir.
- Lady Delamere.

1187
02:14:42,206 --> 02:14:44,199
- How do you do?
- Lady Delamere.

1188
02:14:47,211 --> 02:14:49,120
- Commissioner.
- Baroness.

1189
02:14:49,213 --> 02:14:51,122
The Baroness von Blixen.

1190
02:14:52,591 --> 02:14:55,296
I'm sorry to know
that Kenya will be losing you.

1191
02:14:55,386 --> 02:14:57,959
- You have heard of my trouble then?
- Yes.

1192
02:14:58,055 --> 02:15:00,178
I regret it.

1193
02:15:00,266 --> 02:15:02,887
- And do you know of my problem now?
- Baroness.

1194
02:15:04,228 --> 02:15:07,644
- This land you want from us.
- Will you help me, Sir Joseph?

1195
02:15:07,731 --> 02:15:09,771
- Baroness, this really isn't the time.
- That's quite difficult.

1196
02:15:13,654 --> 02:15:15,694
- Baroness.
- Please, get up.

1197
02:15:19,368 --> 02:15:21,989
Kenya is a hard country
for women...

1198
02:15:23,038 --> 02:15:24,948
so there is a chivalry here,
of a sort.

1199
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:28,741
You are a powerful man,
and I have no one else to turn to.

1200
02:15:28,836 --> 02:15:30,793
Let's discuss this
in the proper way.

1201
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:33,631
You mustn't be embarrassed.
I've lost everything.

1202
02:15:33,716 --> 02:15:35,673
- It costs me very little to beg you.
- Wait.

1203
02:15:38,387 --> 02:15:40,380
Give her a moment, please.

1204
02:15:50,733 --> 02:15:53,140
This land was theirs, you see.

1205
02:15:53,235 --> 02:15:56,402
We took it,
and now they have nowhere else to go.

1206
02:15:56,489 --> 02:16:00,356
I'll look into it.
We'll do the best we can.

1207
02:16:00,451 --> 02:16:02,360
May I have your word, sir?

1208
02:16:08,209 --> 02:16:09,537
You have mine.

1209
02:16:20,179 --> 02:16:21,638
Thank you.

1210
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:24,799
I hope you will be happy here.

1211
02:16:25,976 --> 02:16:27,601
I was.

1212
02:16:28,854 --> 02:16:30,811
I'm sorry I won't know you.

1213
02:16:45,246 --> 02:16:47,618
I didn't hear it
until I got to the border.

1214
02:16:47,706 --> 02:16:50,826
It seems I'll do almost anything
to get your attention.

1215
02:16:57,091 --> 02:16:59,000
I've nearly got you packed.

1216
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:08,008
And my poor family,
I've got them near bankrupt.

1217
02:17:08,102 --> 02:17:10,807
Now I have to ask them for more money.

1218
02:17:12,356 --> 02:17:17,101
- Let me help you.
- You would keep me, then?

1219
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:25,321
No. I want to be
worth something now.

1220
02:17:27,371 --> 02:17:29,779
What will you do?

1221
02:17:29,874 --> 02:17:32,625
After my rummage sale, leave.

1222
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:34,786
Friday for Mombasa, and then...

1223
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,422
the boat to Denmark.

1224
02:17:55,733 --> 02:17:57,144
Thank you.

1225
02:18:07,828 --> 02:18:10,580
You must have them ready to leave
before the rains.

1226
02:18:10,664 --> 02:18:13,120
It is good land, enough for all.

1227
02:18:13,209 --> 02:18:16,245
But they must not fight about it
or be any trouble to the authorities.

1228
02:18:16,337 --> 02:18:20,417
Do you understand?
Or they will lose it.

1229
02:18:20,508 --> 02:18:24,968
You must make them understand
that I will not be here...

1230
02:18:25,054 --> 02:18:26,928
to speak for them.

1231
02:18:27,014 --> 02:18:29,801
This land is far?

1232
02:18:29,892 --> 02:18:31,303
Not too far.

1233
02:18:35,022 --> 02:18:39,483
How can it be now
with me and yourself?

1234
02:18:39,568 --> 02:18:43,317
You will have some money.
Enough, I think.

1235
02:18:43,405 --> 02:18:45,315
I do not speak of money.

1236
02:18:49,537 --> 02:18:52,158
Do you remember how it was...

1237
02:18:52,248 --> 02:18:54,157
on safari?

1238
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:58,294
In the afternoons I would
send you ahead to look for a camp...

1239
02:18:58,379 --> 02:19:00,455
and you would wait for me.

1240
02:19:00,548 --> 02:19:02,754
You can see the fire...

1241
02:19:02,842 --> 02:19:04,751
and come to this place.

1242
02:19:07,513 --> 02:19:08,972
Yes.

1243
02:19:10,683 --> 02:19:12,592
Well, it will be like that.

1244
02:19:15,187 --> 02:19:19,102
Only this time I will go ahead
and wait for you.

1245
02:19:21,193 --> 02:19:24,609
It is far,
where you are going?

1246
02:19:27,366 --> 02:19:28,908
Yes.

1247
02:19:30,369 --> 02:19:33,619
You must make this fire very big...

1248
02:19:33,706 --> 02:19:36,375
so I can find you.

1249
02:19:43,382 --> 02:19:45,291
Take that out to the lawn.

1250
02:20:26,008 --> 02:20:27,917
Have you had dinner?

1251
02:20:30,429 --> 02:20:31,888
Yes.

1252
02:20:39,105 --> 02:20:41,346
Your things...
I packed your things.

1253
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:43,848
I thought I would send them
on to the club.

1254
02:20:43,943 --> 02:20:45,567
Is that all right?

1255
02:21:07,883 --> 02:21:10,505
This wasn't a very good idea.

1256
02:21:23,232 --> 02:21:25,984
I think we should have
had it this way all the time.

1257
02:21:28,237 --> 02:21:30,146
I don't know.

1258
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:32,362
I was beginning to like
your things.

1259
02:21:33,742 --> 02:21:37,076
And I was beginning to like
living without them.

1260
02:21:46,922 --> 02:21:49,709
You've ruined it for me,
you know.

1261
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:52,337
Ruined what?

1262
02:21:56,432 --> 02:21:57,926
Being alone.

1263
02:22:01,103 --> 02:22:02,562
Have I?

1264
02:22:09,236 --> 02:22:11,608
I'd like to come with you
to Mombasa.

1265
02:22:15,075 --> 02:22:16,902
Can I fly you there?

1266
02:22:18,412 --> 02:22:20,405
Aren't you going away again?

1267
02:22:21,457 --> 02:22:24,826
I have some things to do tomorrow
at Tsavo, but I'll be back on Friday.

1268
02:22:27,087 --> 02:22:29,294
Will that be all right?

1269
02:22:31,592 --> 02:22:33,003
Of course.

1270
02:22:38,057 --> 02:22:41,177
I've got this little thing
that I've learned to do lately.

1271
02:22:42,895 --> 02:22:45,812
When it gets so bad...

1272
02:22:45,898 --> 02:22:49,812
and I think I can't go on...

1273
02:22:49,902 --> 02:22:52,358
I try to make it worse.

1274
02:22:54,281 --> 02:22:57,401
I make myself think about our camp
on the river...

1275
02:23:01,413 --> 02:23:02,872
and Berkeley...

1276
02:23:05,376 --> 02:23:08,163
and the first time
that you took me flying.

1277
02:23:10,214 --> 02:23:12,171
How good it all was.

1278
02:23:16,554 --> 02:23:19,804
And when I'm certain
that I can't stand it...

1279
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:22,298
I go one moment more.

1280
02:23:25,062 --> 02:23:28,099
And then I know
I can bear anything.

1281
02:23:32,403 --> 02:23:34,609
Would you like to help me?

1282
02:23:35,656 --> 02:23:36,937
Yes.

1283
02:23:47,251 --> 02:23:49,208
Come dance with me then.

1284
02:24:37,384 --> 02:24:39,460
You were right, you know.

1285
02:24:39,553 --> 02:24:42,127
The farm never did belong to me.

1286
02:24:44,767 --> 02:24:46,676
I may have been wrong.

1287
02:24:48,229 --> 02:24:51,016
I had a farm in Africa.

1288
02:24:54,235 --> 02:24:56,192
- Friday.
- Yes.

1289
02:26:41,634 --> 02:26:43,425
Would you like a drink?

1290
02:26:47,223 --> 02:26:48,681
Please.

1291
02:27:08,035 --> 02:27:09,660
Denys has been killed.

1292
02:27:12,373 --> 02:27:14,780
His plane crashed at Tsavo.

1293
02:27:36,021 --> 02:27:37,564
There was a fire.

1294
02:27:51,245 --> 02:27:53,368
Can I take you into town, Tanne?

1295
02:27:56,750 --> 02:27:58,542
Why did they send you?

1296
02:28:02,339 --> 02:28:04,166
I thought I should.

1297
02:28:12,016 --> 02:28:13,925
My God, you are brave.

1298
02:28:53,057 --> 02:28:56,805
"The sun shall not smite thee by day,
nor the moon at night.

1299
02:28:56,894 --> 02:28:59,978
The Lord shall preserve thee
from all evil.

1300
02:29:00,064 --> 02:29:02,270
He shall preserve thy soul.

1301
02:29:02,358 --> 02:29:05,643
The Lord shall preserve thy going out
and thy coming in.

1302
02:29:05,736 --> 02:29:08,903
From this time forth
and even forevermore."

1303
02:29:08,989 --> 02:29:11,196
Amen.

1304
02:29:37,351 --> 02:29:40,138
"The time you won
your town the race...

1305
02:29:41,355 --> 02:29:44,641
we chaired you
through the marketplace.

1306
02:29:44,733 --> 02:29:47,106
Man and boy stood cheering by...

1307
02:29:47,194 --> 02:29:50,978
as home we brought you,
shoulder high.

1308
02:29:52,700 --> 02:29:57,326
Smart lad,
to slip betimes away...

1309
02:29:57,413 --> 02:30:00,449
from fields where glory
does not stay.

1310
02:30:02,084 --> 02:30:05,168
Early though
the laurel grows...

1311
02:30:05,254 --> 02:30:08,041
it withers quicker than a rose.

1312
02:30:09,216 --> 02:30:11,672
Now you will not swell the rout...

1313
02:30:11,761 --> 02:30:14,133
of lads that wore their honours out.

1314
02:30:15,222 --> 02:30:18,674
Runners whom renown outran...

1315
02:30:18,768 --> 02:30:21,140
and the name died...

1316
02:30:21,228 --> 02:30:22,687
before the man.

1317
02:30:24,774 --> 02:30:27,525
And round that early laurelled head...

1318
02:30:28,611 --> 02:30:31,647
will flock to gaze
the strengthless dead...

1319
02:30:33,449 --> 02:30:36,865
and find unwithered on its curls...

1320
02:30:38,746 --> 02:30:40,205
a garland...

1321
02:30:47,254 --> 02:30:50,089
briefer than a girl's."

1322
02:31:07,066 --> 02:31:10,980
Now take back the soul
of Denys George Finch Hatton...

1323
02:31:12,696 --> 02:31:14,985
whom You have shared with us.

1324
02:31:17,535 --> 02:31:19,492
He brought us joy...

1325
02:31:21,247 --> 02:31:23,204
and we loved him well.

1326
02:31:26,752 --> 02:31:28,661
He was not ours.

1327
02:31:32,508 --> 02:31:34,417
He was not mine.

1328
02:32:44,914 --> 02:32:48,283
If I know a song of Africa...

1329
02:32:49,084 --> 02:32:51,207
of the giraffe...

1330
02:32:51,295 --> 02:32:55,044
and the African new moon
lying on her back...

1331
02:32:56,258 --> 02:32:59,010
of the ploughs in the fields...

1332
02:32:59,095 --> 02:33:02,594
and the sweaty faces
of the coffee pickers...

1333
02:33:03,891 --> 02:33:07,474
does Africa know a song of me?

1334
02:33:09,396 --> 02:33:11,934
Will the air over the plain quiver...

1335
02:33:12,024 --> 02:33:14,811
with a colour that I have had on?

1336
02:33:16,862 --> 02:33:19,484
Or will the children invent a game...

1337
02:33:19,573 --> 02:33:21,981
in which my name is?

1338
02:33:23,702 --> 02:33:26,407
Or the full moon throw a shadow...

1339
02:33:26,497 --> 02:33:28,952
over the gravel of the drive...

1340
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:33,000
that was like me?

1341
02:33:33,087 --> 02:33:37,832
Or will the eagles of the Ngong Hills
look out for me?

1342
02:33:50,438 --> 02:33:52,810
You cannot come where I am going.

1343
02:33:52,898 --> 02:33:55,057
There is no cooking
where you are going?

1344
02:33:56,735 --> 02:34:00,899
You would not like it there.
You must trust me about this.

1345
02:34:24,221 --> 02:34:27,637
Letters you can send on
to this address in Denmark.

1346
02:34:27,725 --> 02:34:31,473
When you sell the car, if you would
send the cheque to Hunter and Company...

1347
02:34:31,562 --> 02:34:34,314
and anything else you don't know
what to do with.

1348
02:34:34,398 --> 02:34:35,809
Yes, ma'am.

1349
02:34:37,902 --> 02:34:41,520
Baroness, I've been sent to ask
if we may stand you a drink.

1350
02:34:42,907 --> 02:34:47,782
- Who is "we"?
- Well, the members, actually.

1351
02:34:51,248 --> 02:34:52,411
All right.

1352
02:35:08,724 --> 02:35:11,096
Whiskey, please.

1353
02:35:11,185 --> 02:35:13,142
Two whiskys, please.

1354
02:35:36,085 --> 02:35:37,199
Baroness?

1355
02:35:39,547 --> 02:35:43,461
Rose-lipped maidens,
light-foot lads.

1356
02:35:43,551 --> 02:35:45,093
Hear, hear.

1357
02:35:53,936 --> 02:35:55,347
Thank you.

1358
02:36:03,696 --> 02:36:05,356
This is very dear to me.

1359
02:36:08,534 --> 02:36:10,610
It has helped me to find my way.

1360
02:36:12,371 --> 02:36:13,782
Thank you, msabu.

1361
02:36:31,015 --> 02:36:33,257
I want to hear you say my name.

1362
02:36:36,395 --> 02:36:40,772
You are Karen, msabu.

1363
02:36:52,745 --> 02:36:54,868
The mail has come today...

1364
02:36:54,955 --> 02:36:57,707
and a friend writes this to me:

1365
02:36:59,084 --> 02:37:03,746
"The Masai have reported
to the district commissioner at Ngong...

1366
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:09,586
that many times at sunrise
and sunset...

1367
02:37:09,678 --> 02:37:14,969
they have seen lions
on Finch Hatton's grave.

1368
02:37:15,059 --> 02:37:18,309
A lion and a lioness
have gone there...

1369
02:37:18,395 --> 02:37:23,307
and stood or lain on the grave
for a long time.

1370
02:37:25,236 --> 02:37:28,818
After you went away,
the ground around the grave...

1371
02:37:28,906 --> 02:37:32,986
was levelled out
into a sort of terrace.

1372
02:37:33,077 --> 02:37:38,664
I suppose that the level place
makes a good site for the lions.

1373
02:37:38,749 --> 02:37:42,829
From there they have a view
over the plain...

1374
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:46,336
and the cattle and game on it."

1375
02:37:48,926 --> 02:37:50,883
Denys will like that.

1376
02:37:51,762 --> 02:37:54,253
I must remember to tell him.

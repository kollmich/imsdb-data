You're gonna get there.Hey, I got something to cheer you up.You know that editor
from Sports Illustratedthat you have been shamelessly
flirting with on the phone for,I don't know, a month, now?
He made a little delivery this morning.Let me see. Don't. No. Hey!- Tomorrow night.
- What happens tomorrow night?Only the most exhilarating
and artistic displayof athletic competition
known to mankind.- The Ice Capades are in town?
- No, the NBA finals are in town,and I got tickets!- Come with me?
- All right, I'll go.But I am not putting out.Two stale jumbo dogs
and a couple of beers,you'll be whistling a different tune.- You know what I like.
- Good morning, ladies.Don't forget,
staff meeting in 30 minutes.Michelle. Haven't seen her all morning.
Have you?- Ten-to-one she's wallowing.
- It's my turn. I'll get her.You get the coffee.

Here, take some samples.Samples. Samples. Great idea.Boy, drama, drama, drama.Hello, Ben.Hey, hey. Good morning, Spears.What are you reading, girl?
You catching up on your current events?"Turn-on Tricks: How to Make Him Hot. "You know, if you wanna try those out
sometime, we should get together.Green and I have an appointment
at Composure,the fastest-growing women's magazine
in the country.And seeing as how our clients
run a lot of our campaignsin their nationally syndicated
little girly magazine,it wouldn't hurt you to do a little reading.- Hey, Benny.
- Good morning, Green.- You finally decided to show up?
- Yes, I did.- You ready?
- Ready. Later, Ben.Have a nice day, ladies.Hi!Good morning, sunshine.Okay, get dressed. Get dressed.
Staff meeting, 15 minutes. Let's go.I'm going back to bed.

- Warren Advertising.- Yes, he's waiting for you. Hold on.
- Good morning.- What's up, kitty cat?
- What's up, daddy? Big night?- Not bad.
- Orgy?- Where were you?
- Not at an orgy.Did you hear?What? That my Knickerbockers
are now in the championship seriesand Tone the Bone, here,
owes me 20 bucks?- Pay him.
- Man, well, you were right.DeLauer Diamonds
is looking for a new ad agency.Warren wants to move on it
aggressively.Yes! Oh, this is a good day.
This is a good day.Guys, did you know that diamondsare about as common
as taxis on 5th Avenue?The value is entirely sentimental,maintained by supply,
demand and advertising.Stripes. Now, DeLauer dominates
the world diamond market.Meaning, if I represent them,
I basically represent the entire industry.- What?
- Warren gave it to the Judys.Spears and Green, they're already on it.- No way!
- Yeah.Well, you know, he's kind of partial
to hot, leggy chicks.Yeah, and we're
the sneakers and beer division.Precious gems aren't exactly our forte.Lips and hips are over
at a chicks' magazine, right now.- I gotta get to Warren before...
- You can't. You can't. He's on a plane.Easy, pal. Chicago meeting.And it's too late anyway 'cause
Warren's meeting them for drinksat Mullen's tonight to discuss their idea.Know what? This didn't happen.
You know why? This was my tip.It's gonna be my pitch, my account,
my campaign. This is my baby.- That's what I'm talking about.
- They will not ace me out of this.- That's right.
- I heard that.- Okay, Mullen's tonight.
- "I heard that"?- Hi.
- Hi.- I don't really wanna talk about it, okay?
- Okay.Okay.Why does this always happen to me?Things are going great
for, like, a week-and-a-halfand then all of a sudden, it's over,
and I am mystified!Seriously, I am mystified
because it always starts out so well.- Poor baby.
- Let's just roll with this.Mike and I had such a connection.The first time that we had sex,
it was so beautiful.I cried.- You cried?
- Yeah.You mean like one glistening tear
on your cheek, right?No, I was really emotional.
I even told him that I loved him.- After how many days?
- Five.Two.It was how I felt.
I wanted to express myself.Okay. Well, what did he say?Oh, Mike didn't have to say anything.
I know that he felt the same.But then, he started getting really busy,
and I didn't know where he was,so I kept calling him, calling him.
He was never home.- You kept calling him?
- I didn't leave a message.He didn't know it was me.
My number's blocked.Oh, I'm sure he thought
it was one of his friends.You know, men frequently
call their friends' answering machinesand hang up 20 times.Anyway, I know why he dumped me.I'm too fat.- You're not fat!
- You're not fat!Michelle, if the most beautiful woman
in the world acted the way you did,any normal guy would still go running
in the other direction.No. No guy would go running
from you, Andie.You could barf all over him
and he would say, "Do it again. "That is both incredibly disgusting
and categorically untrue.If I did the things you did,
I'd get dumped, too.Okay, family, shoes off.And breathe.Out.Okay, Lori, let's start with you.Well, the BOTOX for Beginners piece
is done.Now, it's a little scary,
but mostly upbeat.Now I'm on
What Your Gyno Won't Tell You,which is also pretty scary,
but, you know, upbeat.I finished my research
on Deadly Pedicures,about the woman who contracted
that fungus from the unsterilized tools.It's a terrible story,
although surprisingly upbeat.- Upbeat.
- Marvelous.What's next for How-To With Andie?Well, I've been working on something
that's, kind of, different.- It's... It's a political piece and it's...
- No.Andie, you work
at Composure magazine.We are fashion, trends, diets,
cosmetic surgeries,salacious gossip, that's Composure.- Okay, but...
- Look, Andie. Okay.The column is new for you.When you turn it into a must-read,then you can write about
whatever you want.Until then, you can write about
whatever I want.- Understood?
- Yeah.Michelle, what have you got?I'm sorry, Lana.
I wasn't feeling very well.- She got dumped.
- Oh, no, Michelle!What a hellish ordeal for you.But I must say,
you are looking fabulous.Are we loving the way she looks, all?- We love the way she looks.
- Oh, you're so right. She looks great.- I haven't eaten since the split.
- Good for you! Write about it.I can't use my personal life for a story.I understand completely.Who will use Michelle's personal life
for a story?- Oh, I will!
- Go.No, no, no! Lana, with all due respect,Lori has no business mucking around
in my personal life, and I can't let her.- I'll do it.
- What?I'll sort of do it. It's...You will be my inspiration.- For?
- Look at Michelle.- She is a great girl, right?
- Yes.An amazing woman.But she has a problem
hanging on to relationships,and doesn't really know
what's she doing wrong,which is like a lot of our readers.So I was thinking that I could start
by dating a guyand then drive him away,but only using the classic mistakes
most women, like Michelle,make all the time.I'll keep a diary of itand it will be sort of
a dating how-to in reverse.- What not to do.
- Yeah.How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.Yes. Go.- Bart, what's new in the shoe...
- Wait, wait, Lana. I'm sorry.Why 10 days?Five days is too short,
and we go to press in 11. Yes?Okay, what we found out
is men are attracted to purple shoes.- Thank you.
- Now, I love them myself...Maybe toss in something spiritual
as well.Who's that chic Buddhist
Richard Gere cavorts with?- The Dalai Lama?
- He's fabulous.- Here's my 10:00. Welcome.
- Hi.Ladies, Judy Spears and Judy Green
from Warren Advertising.We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins for the fall.Jeannie Ashcroft, fashion and trends.
Michelle Rubin, fitness and health.Excuse me. Hi.And Andie Anderson,
our resident how-to girl.Oh, I've seen your column, Andie.
What are you working on now?How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.She's actually going to
start dating a guyand then drive him away
in a week-and-a-half.Sounds needlessly vicious.It's going to be fabulous.Now, all she has to do is run along
and find the lucky guy.- Go, go, go.
- Nice to meet you.Ladies, come.Find the guy. Find the guy.You are never going to pull this off.Watch me. Tonight, I'll hook a guy.
Tomorrow, pull the switch.Before the 10 days are up,I'm gonna have this guy
running for his life.You're not gonna burn his apartment
down or bite him or anything, are you?No, I'm gonna limit myselfto doing everything girls do wrong
in relationships.Basically,
everything we know guys hate.I'll be clingy, needy.- Be touchy-feely.
- Yeah.Call him in the middle of the nightand tell him everything
you had to eat that day.What's wrong with that?I'm kidding.Hello, Ben.- What are you doing here?
- Phil, I'm here for the meeting. Ladies.- But, you weren't invited.
- Yeah, but I should have been.I mean, it was my tip that DeLauer
was shopping for a new firm.Yes, it was, but I have to think
in terms of who's best suitedwithin the company team.Yes, sir, and that's me.
I wanna handle this pitch.Ben, you sell Joe Blow
better than anyone else in my shop,but these girls sell luxury
better than anyone else in the business.We have to put our best foot forward
on this pitch.- DeLauer would be our biggest account.
- Yes, sir, they would.Annual advertising billings
of 50 to 60 million dollars,and I am the man that's gonna
bring this home for you, Phil.- Why this place?
- Because it's perfect.- Hi, Ingrid.
- Hi.Mullen's is the aprÃ¨s-work watering hole
for the upwardly mobile.Now, to date, the diamond industry
has always targeted men,sending the message that the woman
needs the man to buy her the rock.All right, they say,
"A diamond is forever. "We say, "A diamond is for everyone. "- I like that.
- Yes.We don't. "A diamond is for everyone"sends the message
that diamonds are everywhere,which means they're not rare,
and if they're not rare,they lose their status.Status is the reason to buy them
in the first place,which Benjamin would know
if he understood women,which you don't.You can't feel bad about that, Ben.
No man does.- Here you go.
- Thank you.Sorry.- Here. Here.
- Thanks.Hey, don't pressure her. She's perusing.Yes, exactly.Selling a diamond to a woman
is like making her fall in love.She has to feel giddy, desirous,
adventurous and desperate.Take a look around this room, Phillip.Most of the women in this bar
are looking for just that.Exactly. The skills required
to market diamondsare the same as those needed
to make a woman fall in love, yes.I'm not talking about lust.
A woman in lust wants chocolate.A woman in love wants diamonds.Yeah, I'm not talking
about lust either, ladies.I'm talking about deep, meaningful,
head-over-heels, his-and-her towels,let's grow old together L-O-V-E.Look, I love women.I do. Whether they're 4 or 40
or my 88-year-old grandmother,I respect women, all right?And I also listen to women.And that's why I can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, anytime.Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, Benjamin, or with you?Either one.- That's cocky, Ben.
- No, not cocky. Confident.- I'd like to see you prove that.
- You would?The agency is co-hosting a party
for the DeLauers at the Astor Museum.The party's a week from Sunday.Do you think you can make a woman
fall in love with you by then?- Ten days.
- Any woman, anywhere, anytime.Any single, available,
straight woman, yes.Yes. I'm not trying to trick you, Ben.
In fact,we'll choose a woman right here,
right now, in this bar,and then you decide.- So who's the lucky girl?
- Okay.Let's see here.There's that blonde babe
in the leopard print.- She looks like fun.
- Be nice, ladies.Or, wow, Miss Babylon 5.
Now she's on the prowl.No.Her.- Her who?
- Her in the gray dress.Blonde hair, pretty smile.Her?- Done.
- What?- Done.
- Done.See the guy next to the horrible guy
in the green shirtthat I would never even consider?- Okay?
- Very cute.- Right?
- Good.Here I go.Okay, you're on.But here are the stakes.- After I win this bet, this pitch is mine.
- Agreed.- Phil?
- Agreed.You come to that party with a girl
that's really in love with you, Ben,you can make the pitch to the DeLauers.- But, Phillip, you can't...
- I've made up my mind.- To the DeLauers.
- To the DeLauers.- Cheers.
- Cheers.I was just wondering if you find...Exciting.Yes, my wife and I love New York,
especially this time of year.- She'd been here before and I...
- Hi.- Hi.
- This is Andie.Hi.- You guys enjoy New York.
- Okay.- Thanks, we will.
- Nice meeting you.- Good luck.
- Thank you, Phil.Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies,
I have a bet to win.Ta-ta.Now do you wanna tell me
what's going on?You don't recognize her?Hi!- Hi.
- Hi.- Andie Anderson.
- Benjamin Barry.- Cute.
- Thank you.I meant your name.Thank you two times.- Unattached?
- Currently.- Likewise.
- Surprising.- Psycho?
- Rarely.- Interested?
- Perhaps.- Hungry?
- Starving.- Leaving.
- Now?- Okay.
- Okay.- One second.
- I'll meet you at the door.Hey, hey, guys.- What?
- I think I got one.- He was married.
- No, not him.It's the guy by the door.
But don't look! No, guys!He is really cute.I'm gonna check this one out
and see if he's the keeper.- Okay.
- And if he is?Tomorrow night I'll...Flip the switch.- I'm doing this for you.
- Well, good luck. Be safe.Call me!Drama, drama, drama.No, no, no. This one.And you get to wear
the goofy-looking helmet.- It's not gonna look goofy on me.
- It looks goofy on just about everybody.Look at you. That's pretty damn cute.There you go.- You ready to go for a ride, Andie?
- Are you ready to go for a ride, Ben?- Get it. Get it?
- Yeah.- So what do you think?
- About the food or you?Both.This is delicious.And I'm still deciding.Anything I can do to help?Yeah, you can answer some questions
for me, actually."Some" sounds a little too indefinite.
I'll give you three.- What do you do for a living?
- I'm in advertising.I work mostly with alcoholic beverage
and athletic equipment companies,and I'm trying to break into
the jewelry market right now.Saving the world
one keg party at a time?Yeah, something like that.- What about you?
- What about me?- Have I seen your work?
- I work at Composure.Fastest-growing women's
fashion magazine in the country.I'm impressed.Saving the world
one shopaholic at a time?Hey, all right. Look here, Sparky.I have a masters in journalism
from Columbia.My boss loves me,
and if I do it her way for a while,I can write about anything I want.Like shoes?No.No.Like alcoholic beverages
and athletic gear.TouchÃ©. Very nice.- So you think you got me all figured out?
- Almost.- I still got one last question.
- Shoot.True or false?All's fair in love and war.True.- Great answer.
- Good question.Welcome.- Oh, nice place.
- Thank you.Very tidy.- Can I get you a cold beer?
- Sure.- Can I use your restroom?
- Yeah, you can.It's up the stairs through the bedroom.You are, aren't you?
The first night. I can't believe you.Michelle,
I'm not going to sleep with him.Oh, you are such a hussy.
You can't hide those lying eyes.No, no, because
I can practice some self-control,- unlike some people I know.
- Oh, really? That hurts, kind of.- I'm gonna dangle the bait.
- Wait. What's the bait?- I'm the bait, Michelle.
- Oh.- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm with you. Then what?A diamond is no one-night stand.A diamond is a long-term commitment.- Takes notes. You better record...
- I can't talk right now. I have to go.- Call me later, you slut.
- Okay, bye.- There you go.
- Thank you.You're welcome.Okay.Hey, hey, let's not go too fast, okay?Yeah.Yeah.We're moving too fast.You're right. It's too fast.Okay.- Too fast.
- Too fast.Yeah.I want you to respect me.- I do.
- Okay.And I want your respect.I respect you for respecting me.I respect that.Good.Good night, Andie Anderson.Oh, you are already
falling in love with me.I'm gonna make you wish
you were dead.Poor guy.Of all the women Spears and Green
could have thrown at me,this one is amazing.Hanging with her for 10 days
is gonna be no problem.Right. That's only nine days longerthan you've ever spent
with any other chick, huh?That's why I didn't
go for the gold immediately.I'm taking my time.
It's a marathon, not a sprint.Ten days is a marathon?Okay, so it's more like
the 3,000 meter hurdles.The point is,
she's already on the ropes, guys.Wow, that's a lot of sports analogy.- Is that it?
- That's it.- Have you looked inside?
- No.Do you have an ethical problem
with rifling through a woman's purse?Yeah, I guess I do.Well, it's hardly a purse, dude.
It's more like a clutch or something.Guys, a woman's purse, all right,
it's her secret source of power.All right, there are many dark
and dangerous things in therethat we, the male species,
should know nothing about.Unless, of course,
she left it behind intentionallyto secure a next-day call back.She's a very clever minx.- I'm sorry! Oh, God!
- We gotta clean that up.Yeah, yeah.Carefully. Carefully.Oh, what have we here?Let us see. Let us see.Knicks tickets.For tonight's game.- Delivery, Andie.
- Wow, look at those!Andie! Oh, my God.Where do you want these?Wait."One hundred times more beautiful... "Wait."... than 100 roses. "- Catchy.
- The guy's in advertising.- He can't help it.
- So does this mean he's hooked?This means he found the Knicks tickets.- You left the tickets in the purse?
- Yeah.You are just
on a whole different playing field.Here you go.Andie Anderson.- Hey, hey, pretty girl.
- Guess what?I got a really embarrassing display
of white roses.Well, you are welcome. Listen,
I had a wonderful time last night.- I have your bag.
- I know.I can't believe I left it there.Well, you must need it back,
what with all the cash, credit cardsand those Knicks tickets
for tonight's game.Sounds like you've been peeking
through my bag, Ben.Oh, absolutely not.Tony, my art director, he's an oaf,
and he accidentally knocked it over.Right. Yeah, I'm a clumsy man.All right. I'm sorry, though.I'm going to the game
with somebody else.Not anymore.Besides, what, you think you left
your purse at my place by accident?No, subconsciously, you are dyingto take me to that game.Denying your subconscious desiresis extremely dangerous to your health,
young lady.Does that psychobabble
really work on anybody?You tell me.Andie, you're so bad.All right, meet me
at the 7th Avenue entrance.-7:30. Don't be late.
- You got it.- Bye-bye.
- Bye.- And that's how it's done.
- And that's how it's done.Foul on number 20, Allan Houston.- Bullshit! Come on, ref!
- What is that, ref?Hey, if you're going to call it,
call it both ways.Oh, you're soft, man!You were soft last year,
and you're still soft!What was that?There we go. Work it around.Defense!- Defense!
- Come on, buddy.Defense!Defense!Defense!Knicks call a 20-second timeout.All right, take your five.
Take your minute.This is all right. We got 20 seconds.
A 20-second T.Knicks ball.Bring it back!Charge!Work your arm, baby.- Charge!
- Go, baby.- Hold 'em up!
- Charge!- Benny.
- What? What? Yeah?Benny, I'm thirsty.- Yeah, yeah!
- Benny, can you go get me a soda?- Yeah, I just wanna tell you, right now...
- I'm parched....there's a minute, nine left
in the game,- and then I'll go up and get it.
- I'm really thirsty.- I'll go get it.
- Hang on.- You want it right now?
- Yeah.Okay, no ice, Ben. Thanks, Benny.Lawrence Funderburke!Here's Sprewell with the fake.
Gets the step on Christie.- What a crossover!
- My man, Coke, no ice.- Next line over, pal.
- No ice.Hey, buddy. Small Coke, no ice.
Small Coke, no ice.Okay, you got it.Just beyond the three-point line. Fires!- No! Man, don't let him have that shot!
- Does that mean no, you don't want ice,- or no, you want ice?
- No. No, no ice. Coke, no ice.Don Chaney wants to talk it over.- Did you want a small?
- No, I want that one, right there.You know, for 25 cents more,
you could get a jumbo.You take that right there.
Keep the change.Charge!Excuse me.Come on, baby, drive in the net!Thanks.Hey, hold him, hold him. Move it.
Set your pick!- Watch the three seconds! Traveling!
- Ben, it's not diet. Ben, it's not diet.Please, I'm so thirsty.- With a lime. With a lime.
- All right, all right.Shoot it!Sprewell for the win. Yes!Latrell Sprewell!It's all over. The Knicks have defeated
the Kings in the final seconds.Latrell Sprewell
with the game-winning shot.And the Knicks over Sacramento 97-96.What an incredible game!I've never seen a more exciting game
played before.Wow. You know, neither have I.Hey, hey, hey. It's too bad you missed it.- Yeah, it's too bad.
- One second.So, are you as nice as you seem, Ben?No.Good, neither am I.Oh, here.Fifth and Twelfth, please. See you later.Horseshit!More horseshit.The horseshit continues. Horseshit.Come on, people.We gotta do a lot better than this
if we're gonna...- What?
- There's a phone call for Mr. Barry.- Yeah, can you take a message, Candi?
- Mr. Barry, it's Andie.- Make it quick.
- I will.- It's line two, Mr. Barry.
- Thank you.- Hello.
- It's me!Listen, I'm in the middle of a meeting.
Can I call you back in just a minute?I miss you,
Benny Boo-Boo Boo-Boo-Boo.Well, you know what, I miss you, too.You busy tonight?No. No, I'm not.Why don't we catch a movie
or something?- A movie? My choice?
- Your choice.Oh, I'm so excited!
Okay, I'll call you later.- Bye-bye.
- Bye.Jonah!I always wanted a man like Tom Hanks.- It's my favorite movie of all time.
- Yeah, me, too.What if something
had happened to you?What if I couldn't get to you?- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing. I'm watching the movie.Yeah, but what's on your mind?I like this movie.Oh, so I suppose
your mind is a complete blank?You are my family. You're all I've got.Who is she?- Who's who?
- The girl you're thinking about.- Can't hear.
- I'm not thinking about a girl.You can't watch Meg Ryan for two hours
and not be thinking about another girl.Lady, shut up.Wanna know what I'm thinking about?Yes.I'm sitting here thinking about
how damn beautiful you are.That's what I'm thinking about.Come here.
Let's watch this movie. It's good.Benji.Oh, sweetie.- I love sharing this with you.
- Yeah.Can't hear and can't see.If you don't shut up,
my boyfriend over hereis gonna come back there
and pummel your ass.Put a muzzle on your old lady
the next time you bring her out in public!- What? What is that? Do something...
- You, outside!Keep it down.Have a little class, all right?You wanna talk like that to me,
we can work it out,- but not to a lady, all right?
- Ben, Ben, he's huge.I got it. I'm not looking
to get into a fight with the guy, okay?He owes you an apology.Now I'm gonna go back inside and
finish watching Sleepless in Seattle.- Nobody screw with me.
- Son of a bitch.Oh, Ben, are you okay?Ben, Ben,
maybe we should get you to a hospital.- No, no, no.
- No, you could have a...Excuse me?Hey, can you hold still?
Right there. Hold still.Okay, I'm sorry.Yeah. That's feeling real nice.
It's starting to feel a little better.Ben. Ben.Ben! Oh, my God! You're fine.You are totally fine.Okay, come on, Rocky. Get up.- Huh?
- Yeah.Hey, don't feel bad.If I had a nickel for every time
I got in a fistfight during a chick flick...- Right. It really wasn't that bad.
- Really?No, I mean, the getting punched
in the face part sucked, right?The getting taken care of
after the punch, it was nice.Florence Nightingale syndrome.You want me to tape
the game for you, tonight?No need, my friend.
I'll be watching the Knicksin the comfort of my own home,
this evening.How'd you swing that?What's the coup de grÃ¢ce?
Heavyweight.- You're making the lamb.
- VoilÃ .A woman loves a man who can cook.
Yeah?Bringing out the big guns.- Let's go deep.
- I like it.Why do they always forget my bacon?I can't believe
you got that guy knocked out.Only for a few seconds.He was the most adorable
unconscious man, ever.Are you dating him,
or are you contemplating adoption?Andie, I am loving your notes
on this piece.Thank you, Lana.- When are you seeing him again?
- Tonight.He's invited me over for dinner.Marvelous.
I've got a feeling about this one.Thanks, Lana.I hate it
when she pops her head in like that.- I never...
- I heard that.And, Andie, tonight, take smaller bites.- Oh, my God.
- Disgusting. I can barely eat over here.Come on in. Door's open.- Hi!
- Hey there.I hope you brought your appetite, girl.

- That's right.- Hi. Pleasure to meet you.

you look rather inspired yourself.There isn't a diamond in the room
that sparkles like a woman in love.Oh, no, no.- I'm not in love.
- No? I guess I was mistaken.No, no, no. I mean, I just...I mean, I've only known him

so Ben would win.Tell him to enjoy his short-lived,
ill-gotten victory.We're going to talk to Warren.No.- Hey.
- Remember us?- Hi!
- Hi.You know, Warren is gonna
come over here in a minute,and it would be so great
if you could just, you know,like, act like you don't know anything
about the bet.I mean, if you could tell him
that you really, truly love Ben, you know,and you weren't just, you know,
pretending so he would win,that would be huge.So what's
the average Composure reader like?Spunky, insatiable. Uppity, you bet.If you'll excuse me, Lana,there's a beautiful young woman
in a yellow dress that I must go to.Andie! She's my how-to girl.- How-to?

and kill each other.So that's what I was, huh?
I was a guinea pig.Somebody you could test
your theories on?Yeah, and I was just a girl
somebody picked out in a bar.Yeah, you know what? Big deal.Hell, I'm sure now you can even use it
as a little twist in your story.That's a good idea.
Maybe we should bet on it.You know what?
You did your job now, Andie.- Yes, I did.
- You wanted to lose a guy in 10 days.Congratulations. You did it.
You just lost him.No, I didn't, Ben.'Cause you can't lose something

economics?This wind is really
more of a light breeze.- What can I write about, Lana?

dressing for your body type.Use your imagination.
The sky is the limit.- Thank you for this opportunity, Lana.

1
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,992
<i>Our hero grew apace,</i>

2
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,164
<i>a country lad far happier
in the woods than in the study.</i>

3
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,331
<i>A bad hero as may be,
with many a weakness.</i>

4
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,834
<i>But then, ifAdam hadn't had
such a weakness for apples,</i>

5
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,292
<i>there would be nobody to tell
Tom's story at all,</i>

6
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,252
<i>and a part of that story</i>

7
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,384
<i>tells of the sport Tom found in the woods.</i>

8
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,474
Oh, Tom.

9
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,438
You wicked dog.

10
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,694
Molly. What are you doing here?

11
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,697
I heard Father tell Mother
you was coming.

12
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,842
It's a good night to be abroad
and looking for game.

13
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,599
Oh, Tom.

14
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,901
Oh, Tom.

15
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,203
<i>It shall be our custom
to leave such scenes</i>

16
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,006
<i>where taste, decorum,
and the censor dictate.</i>

17
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,253
<i>In this way we shall try to make up
for our incorrigible hero.</i>

18
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,640
<i>As soon as he had left
the disreputable Molly,</i>

19
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:19,016
<i>what did he do butjoin
her equally disreputable father,</i>

20
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,062
<i>Black George,</i>

21
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,187
<i>gamekeeper to Squire Allworthy.</i>

22
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,609
Come on.

23
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,486
I hear 'em.

24
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,942
Psst!

25
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,528
Come on, lads. We'll smoke 'em out.

26
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,454
Fetch it! Fetch it, boy!

27
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,497
- Come on.
- Wait!

28
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,076
That's fallen on Squire Western's ground.

29
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,752
Well, let's after it.

30
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,376
No. I've been warned for trespassing.

31
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,674
It's our bird. Don't worry, Blackie.

32
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,218
- Come back, Tom!
- Here, boy.

33
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,047
Here, boy. Here, boy. Good.

34
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,178
All right, you devils! I'll get you!

35
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,351
I'll have your blood!

36
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,019
- I'll have you out!
- Run, Blackie!

37
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,891
Let's give the old man
a run for his money.

38
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,977
Oh, no!

39
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,313
Whee! Whee!

40
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,990
Yah-hah! Yah!

41
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,702
Yahoo!

42
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,451
Yea! Yea, yea, yea!

43
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,032
Good sir...

44
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,867
Home, lads.

45
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,668
I'll get 'em another night.

46
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,502
- I thought I'd lost you in the woods.
- Shortcut.

47
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,255
- We'll be caught one of these days.
- Don't worry.

48
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,429
It's all right for you.
You haven't got a family to keep.

49
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,677
I'll look after you.

50
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,474
Here.

51
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,644
- Huh?
- Take this guinea.

52
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,058
Good night, Blackie.

53
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,229
<i>Our hero, alas,
was always being exploited</i>

54
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,857
<i>by villains like Black George.</i>

55
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,363
<i>For a generous man
is merely a fool in the eyes of a thief.</i>

56
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,538
<i>- A sheep?
- Aye, sir, an entire sheep.</i>

57
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,247
A fat animal,
enough to feed a village for a week.

58
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,754
Hanging up in his cottage
as proud as a battle trophy.

59
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,587
- This is a grave matter.
- A hanging matter.

60
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,093
Sir, if I may speak on his behalf,
I'd like...

61
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,095
Be silent.

62
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,927
Are you guilty?

63
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,058
I am... guilty.

64
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,639
- Sir, forgive him.
- Be quiet, sir.

65
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,979
<i>I have to do justice here.</i>

66
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,607
You have committed a capital crime.

67
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,905
The laws have provided
the most terrible penalty...

68
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,823
to hang by your neck.

69
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,156
But you have children.

70
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,707
For their sake,
I shall only dismiss you my service.

71
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,910
And may God have mercy on you.

72
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,171
You're too lenient, Mr. Allworthy.

73
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,170
Compassion is one thing, sir,
but justice is another.

74
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,011
<i>Mr. Thwackum and Mr. Square
were Tom's tutors.</i>

75
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,596
<i>Over the years they tried,
with little success,</i>

76
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,932
<i>to thrash into Tom
a sense of virtue and religion.</i>

77
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,860
<i>They had, however, a more aptpupil.</i>

78
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,771
<i>Soon after Tom had been found,</i>

79
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,653
<i>the squire's sister, Bridget,
married a Captain Blifil</i>

80
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,234
<i>and they had a son.</i>

81
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,786
<i>This young man
was quite different from Tom.</i>

82
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,115
<i>He was sober, discreet,
and pious beyond his age,</i>

83
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,793
<i>and the whole neighborhood
resounded in his praise.</i>

84
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,923
You have only taught Tom to laugh
at whatever is decent and virtuous and right.

85
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,047
- I've taught him religion.
- Mr. Thwackum.

86
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,721
The word "religion"
is as vague and uncertain

87
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,548
as any in the English language.

88
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,554
When I mention religion,
I mean the Christian religion.

89
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,931
Not only the Christian religion,
but the Protestant religion.

90
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,388
And not only the Protestant religion,
but the Church of England.

91
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,441
I fear that Tom
is the embodiment of the old truth

92
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,361
that foundlings
should be left to the parish.

93
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,486
My dear tutors, I'm afraid neither of you
can touch his bastard's heart.

94
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,659
<i>Neither, indeed.</i>

95
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,157
<i>But there was another who could.</i>

96
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,579
- Tom.
- Mmm?

97
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,131
- I want you to help me.
- How?

98
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,593
I want you to get me a post, Tom.

99
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,220
Uh-huh.

100
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,475
Miss Western's come back from France
and'll be wanting a maid.

101
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,436
I'll speak to her.

102
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,933
Tom, you are kind to me.

103
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,865
Miss Western's maid.

104
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,296
Sophie Western! Miss Western!

105
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,380
Why, Tom Jones!

106
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,383
I've brought you a thrush.

107
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,975
It's beautiful, Tom. How kind of you.

108
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,148
Two years is a long time.

109
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,352
Did they teach you London ways
and make a great lady of you?

110
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,654
Most of the time I was in France.
My aunt took me there.

111
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,652
Ooh-la!
Did you like France, Miss Western?

112
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,825
<i>Mais oui, monsieur.
Je me suis très bien amusée, merci.</i>

113
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,278
<i>- Bon, bon.
- You haven't changed, Tom.</i>

114
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,580
You've grown, Sophie.
Grown more beautiful than ever.

115
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,162
Doesn't he sing beautifully?
I shall teach him some new songs.

116
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,624
I doubt if an English bird
can learn French songs, Miss Western.

117
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,958
You'll see.

118
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,975
Your father asked us all to supper.

119
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,645
I came early to ask if you could help Molly,
Black George's daughter.

120
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,223
Oh, yes. Father told me the story.
He stole a sheep, didn't he?

121
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,901
Black George is a poor man
with big, hungry daughters to feed.

122
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,608
Most hungry. I can vouch for it.

123
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,191
Well, I have a maid already, Tom,
but I'll see if I can do anything.

124
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,241
Good, good, good.

125
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,707
- Ah, welcome, neighbors!
- Ah, Squire!

126
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,627
- Welcome, welcome.
- How nice to see you.

127
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,999
Welcome, madam.

128
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,753
- Where's the squire?
- Good day, Western, good day!

129
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,755
Look! Tom's bought me a thrush!

130
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,461
Oh, what a sweet little bird.

131
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,638
His song is sweeter
than any tune of Mr. Handel's.

132
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,011
Ah! Handel.

133
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,639
Tom, thank you.

134
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,392
- She'll dote on it well.
- Welcome home, Sophie.

135
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,393
How lovely you're looking, child.

136
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,816
- Aye, it's good to have her home.
- Good day, Miss Western.

137
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,518
Let's all go in to dinner.

138
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,947
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my little bird.

139
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,659
Don't worry, Sophie.
I'll get it back for you.

140
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,461
- Tom.
- Ah, good lad, Tom.

141
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,503
- Do be careful.
- Be careful, Tom. Tom, take care.

142
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,585
- I'll wager he gets it!
- Take care.

143
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,671
I am sorry to cause you this distress,
Miss Western.

144
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,303
I did not think the bird would fly away.

145
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,601
But still, I cannot help observing
that the idea of caged birds

146
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,519
is against the laws of nature.

147
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,188
Don't you agree, Mr. Square?

148
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,103
He's got him!

149
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,560
Aah!

150
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,815
Oh!

151
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,738
He'll drown!

152
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,066
- Quick, get him out!
- He's got the bird!

153
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,322
- Help him, someone!
- I've got him!

154
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,244
Come on, lad! Give me your hand!

155
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:37,041
Damn me if I won't love the boy for this
as long as I have to live.

156
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,914
- Serves him right.
- And you, sir.

157
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,599
<i>The weeks passed,
and Mollygrew apace too.</i>

158
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,017
Why, you lazy slut, you.

159
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,724
Look at her with her great belly, aye.

160
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,481
That I should ever have lived
to see this day.

161
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,732
You'd better have minded
what the parson says

162
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,780
and not harkened after menfolks.

163
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,449
She's the first one of this family
ever was to be a whore.

164
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,028
Oh, Mother, you yourself
was brought to bed with Sister there

165
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,829
a week after you was married.

166
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,909
Oh, but I were made
an honest women of. But you...

167
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,712
You have to be doing with gentlemen,
don't you, you nasty slut, you?

168
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,165
You know what you will have, don't you?
You will have a bastard.

169
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,171
And I defy anybody to say that of me!

170
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,878
- My gentleman'll look after me.
- Your gentleman.

171
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,430
Far from "gentleman," your gentleman.

172
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,678
You lay off me,
or I'll tell my gentleman...

173
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,356
Let these be constantly applied.

174
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,651
And then, though we cannot...

175
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,319
- What?
- absolutely promise success,

176
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,820
yet may properly say, with the apostle,

177
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,486
"What knowest thou, O wife,

178
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,118
whether thou shalt save thy husband?"

179
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,744
And now, my dear brethren,
let us sing together the hymn,

180
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,796
"O God, Our Help in Ages Past."

181
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,227
<i>Let dogs delight to bark and bite,</i>

182
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,279
<i>for God hath made them so.</i>

183
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,402
<i>Let bears and lions growl and fight,</i>

184
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,280
<i>for 'tis their nature too.</i>

185
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,158
<i>But, ladies, you should never
let such angrypassions rise.</i>

186
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,912
<i>Your little hands were never made
to tear each other's eyes.</i>

187
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,662
There she is. Let's get at her.

188
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,460
Let's thrash her.

189
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,088
Won't have the likes of her in this village.

190
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,636
Won't have her mixing with us good folk.

191
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,884
Take that, ya hussy!

192
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:57,885
Ha!

193
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,108
I'll get you, Goody Brown,
you dirty old harridan!

194
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,423
Back! Back! Please!

195
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,878
Away! Leave her! Leave her!

196
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,931
We don't have to fight! Out of the way!

197
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,387
Leave her!

198
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,273
Oh, Tom.

199
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,895
Oh, Tom.

200
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,485
Don't... Don't leave me, Tom.

201
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,905
Don't worry. Don't worry.

202
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,109
Shh.

203
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,661
Slowly. Slowly.

204
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,667
Don't worry. Don't worry.

205
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,252
That filthy slut.

206
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,752
Ah, good boy, good boy.

207
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,837
He's a game lad, your Tom.

208
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:01,547
So, the wench is having a bastard, eh?

209
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,507
Yes.

210
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,811
It seems the girl has refused
to name the father to Mr. Allworthy.

211
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,647
He may have to send her to Bridewell.

212
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,350
Father, I have a headache.

213
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,436
I smoke it.

214
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,447
I smoke it!

215
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,741
Tom is the father of that bastard!

216
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,953
Aye! As sure as tuppence,
Tom is the bastard's father!

217
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,659
- Father...
- Ods zodikins!

218
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,245
What a little whoremaster that boy is!

219
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,251
The girl is ruined, surely.

220
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,334
Aye! Ruined! Ruined, for sure!

221
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,339
Once broken, never mended, eh?

222
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,479
It'll do no harm.

223
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,557
A- Ask Sophie.

224
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,813
She knows about Tom.

225
00:19:55,903 --> 00:20:00,568
You have no worse opinion of a young fellow
for getting a bastard, have you, girl?

226
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,571
Well, stop bobbing up and down, girl.

227
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,701
No, no, the women will like him
the better for it.

228
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,656
Won't they? Whoo-hoo! Ha!

229
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,412
Uh, come, Sophie.
Sing us one of your jolly songs.

230
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,996
Not tonight, Father. I have a headache.

231
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,130
Let's have "St. George, He was for England,"
or "Bobbing Joan."

232
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,428
That's a good song for tonight, eh?

233
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,140
None of your old Handel now,
my little darling.

234
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,522
Ah, you play like an angel.

235
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,663
<i>Molly's reputation was destroyed,</i>

236
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,871
<i>and Tom's heart was heavy with remorse.</i>

237
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,126
<i>Perhaps Mr. Square had been right</i>

238
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:03,210
<i>that the wicked are snared
in the work of their own hands.</i>

239
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,232
Oh. Mr. Jones.

240
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,311
- Where's Molly?
- Oh, she... she ain't home.

241
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,231
She's upstairs... in bed.

242
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,081
Who is it?

243
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,208
It's me. Tom.

244
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,921
Why haven't you been
to see me before this, Tom?

245
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,126
Molly, I-I-I...

246
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,927
- Ah!
- Well, I hope to explain...

247
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,925
I thought you said
you'd be my gentleman.

248
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,222
I hoped to explain why...

249
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,766
So you're not going to admit
you've had your wicked will of me.

250
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,844
- Molly.
- No.

251
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,851
I shall never love another man but you, Tom.

252
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,400
Not if the greatest squire in the country
should come a-courtin' to me,

253
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,398
I couldn't give myself to him.

254
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,571
No, Tom.

255
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,571
Not for all the riches in the world,
now that you've gained my heart.

256
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,788
You are a lecherous rascal after all, Tom!

257
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:18,585
I shall always hate and despise
the whole sex on account of you, Tom!

258
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,957
<i>Mr. Square!</i>

259
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:27,257
<i>Molly's favors, after all,
had not been bestowed on Tom alone.</i>

260
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,715
<i>Our hero, unlike many other men,</i>

261
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:34,677
<i>was fortunate enough to discover
the father of his child in time.</i>

262
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,643
Ah!

263
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,691
And after everyone's kindness too.

264
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,645
She has laid the child
at young Mr. Jones's door.

265
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,651
All the parish say Mr. Allworthy
is so angry with Mr. Jones

266
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,323
that he won't see him.

267
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,369
To be sure, one can't help
pitying the poor young man.

268
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,320
He's so pretty a gentleman.

269
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,623
I should be sorry
to see him turned out of doors.

270
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,544
Why do you tell me all this?
What concern have I in what Mr. Jones does?

271
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,791
Why, ma'am,
I never thought as it was any harm

272
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,124
to say a young man was handsome.

273
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,756
But I shall never think of him anymore now,
for handsome is as handsome does.

274
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,296
Tittle, tattle, tittle, tattle.

275
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,383
- I shall be late for the hunt.
- Sorry, I'm sure, madam.

276
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,637
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hyup!

277
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,724
Move in, my hunters! Where's the cider?

278
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,440
Greetings, my boy!

279
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,273
- Hey-hey, my beauty!
- Good morning, Squire.

280
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,154
Splendid! Simply splendid!

281
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,903
Welcome, everyone!

282
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,454
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Western.

283
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,658
Morning. Morning.
Isn't it beautiful, beautiful weather?

284
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,870
- Oh, you brute.
- Good morning, everybody.

285
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,875
- Welcome, my lady.
- Good morning.

286
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,422
And you, sir.

287
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,124
Greetings, everyone.

288
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,631
Ah, welcome. You're getting no younger.

289
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,008
I mean the horse, madam!

290
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,181
Let's stir a cup, everyone!

291
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,351
- Good cheer, everybody!
- Come help yourselves, everyone!

292
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,053
You need to eat and drink!

293
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,224
Sure. The church is always first
with the bread and wine.

294
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,525
Health to everyone!

295
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,193
Ohh! It's right for you, eh?

296
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,534
Well, miss isn't speaking today?

297
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,612
Drink up, everyone!

298
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,160
Huntsmen, loose the hounds!

299
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,037
Another dab of mead then?

300
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,923
Ah! The hounds!

301
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,046
Oh, come on, my sweetheart!

302
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,048
Go on, me lovely boys and girls!

303
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,346
Come on, come on!

304
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,718
There you are!

305
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,435
I'll drop a cider inside you, boy.
Then you'll be ready for the kill.

306
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:48,235
- Good cheer, Miss Western.
- Go on! Drink up, everyone!

307
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,107
Go on! Drink up!

308
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,735
There's some Western brew
for you, my girls!

309
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,861
Stop it!

310
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,943
Squire, it's too early!

311
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,403
You'll tire yourself!

312
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,033
On we go!

313
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,834
Good hunt, everyone!
Good health! Good hunting!

314
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,761
Yea!

315
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,771
Away!

316
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,415
Come on! Down he goes!
Go on, boys!

317
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,246
After him!

318
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,374
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

319
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,012
Come on! Come on!

320
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,472
Come on!

321
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,855
Come on, Sophie! Hurry! Hurry!

322
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,937
Come on, sweetheart!
After him, after him!

323
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,279
Tallyho!

324
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,407
Tallyho!

325
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,867
Go on! Here he comes! Go on!

326
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,590
Come on!

327
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,560
Ah! Here he is!

328
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,807
- I trust you're not harmed.
- No, no, I'm quite safe.

329
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,813
How can I ever thank you, Mr. Jones?

330
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,270
If I have preserved you, madam,
I am sufficiently repaid.

331
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,321
I hope you're not hurt.

332
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,984
If I have broke my arm,
I consider it a trifle

333
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,990
in comparison
to what I feared on your account.

334
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,288
Broken your arm?

335
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,161
I'm afraid I have, madam.

336
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,459
Yet I have another to lead you home.

337
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,176
Look at him, ma'am.

338
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,800
He's the most handsome man
I ever saw in my life.

339
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,222
Why, Honor, I do believe
you're in love with him.

340
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,175
I assure you, ma'am, I'm not.

341
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,727
If you were, I see no reason
that you should be ashamed of it.

342
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,809
For he is certainly a handsome fellow.

343
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,358
That he is, the most handsome man
I ever saw in my life.

344
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:25,280
And as you say, ma'am, I don't know why
I should be ashamed of looking at him,

345
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,072
even though he is my better.

346
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,993
For gentlefolk are but
flesh and blood like us servants.

347
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,616
I am an honest person's child,

348
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,322
and my father and mother were married,

349
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,908
which is more than some people can say,
as high as they hold their heads.

350
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,083
Honor!

351
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,082
My grandfather was a clergyman,

352
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,755
and he would have been very angry
to have thought any of his family

353
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,798
had taken up with Molly Seagrim's leavings.

354
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,465
Why, ma'am,
the young gentleman is awake!

355
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,139
Yes, you have awakened him
with your foolish chatter.

356
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,059
I feel awake for the first time, madam.

357
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,027
"...accordingly, after narrow scru...

358
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,534
narrow scrutiny,

359
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,911
found some magical books,"

360
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,923
"several vials of strange liquors,
pots of ointment."

361
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,330
Do you remember that picnic,
Sister, last year,

362
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,500
when Western sat on the wasp's nest?

363
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,078
Oh, I shall never forget it!

364
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,216
- Hmm.
- Brother. Brother.

365
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,298
- Brother.
- Whoa! Whoa!

366
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,975
- Oh, no! I can't...
- Whoa, back! It's all right. It's all right.

367
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,681
Now, keep... Whoa!

368
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,233
No, no, no! No!

369
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,411
Oi!

370
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,043
Why the long face, Blif?

371
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,679
- A terrible thing.
- What's happened?

372
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,007
There's been an accident.
My mother is dead.

373
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,221
Blif.

374
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,983
Is Squire Allworthy?

375
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,565
He's not expected to live.

376
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,361
Shh. Fever has developed,
and there's little hope.

377
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,741
We can only pray.

378
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,162
Something for which you have scant relish.

379
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,459
For as much as it hath pleased
almighty God of his great mercy

380
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:01,964
to take unto himself the soul
of our dear sister, here departed,

381
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,295
we therefore commit her body
to the ground.

382
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:08,383
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

383
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,763
dust to dust,

384
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,643
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life

385
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,684
through our Lord, Jesus Christ.

386
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,643
- Amen.
- Amen.

387
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,695
Well, there's another one gone.

388
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,773
- Hush.
- Well...

389
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,378
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

390
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,797
Well, cheer up, lad.

391
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,966
She will be with the angels, my boy.

392
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,135
Our mortal forms
are but shadows of a purer reality.

393
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,594
Thank you, sir,
for your comforting words.

394
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,676
She was a great lady.

395
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,807
Sir, some time before your mother died,
she gave me a letter.

396
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:02,396
Her instructions were to hand it
to Mr. Allworthy as she was buried.

397
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,401
Hand it to me. I will give it to my uncle.

398
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,529
She expressly said
into no hands but Mr. Allworthy's.

399
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,159
Lawyer Dowling, if my uncle lives,
he will need a new steward.

400
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,615
I intend to recommend you.

401
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,996
You are most kind, sir.

402
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,452
Mmm.

403
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,551
Do not grieve, my dear nephew.

404
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,978
Do not grieve.

405
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,057
Sir, you cannot die.

406
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,484
Death comes to us all, Tom.

407
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:52,529
I have asked you here
to tell you of my will.

408
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:58,038
Nephew Blifil, I leave you heir
to my whole estate,

409
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,914
with these exceptions.

410
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,295
To you, my dear Tom,

411
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:09,174
I have given an estate of £800 a year,

412
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,848
together with £1,000 in ready money.

413
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,678
I am convinced, my boy,

414
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:21,015
that you have much goodness, generosity,

415
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,022
and honor in your nature.

416
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,025
If you will add prudence

417
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,152
and religion to these,

418
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,653
you must be happy.

419
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,958
One thousand pounds
I leave to you, Mr. Thwackum,

420
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,626
and a like sum to you, Mr. Square,

421
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:47,129
which I am convinced exceeds
your desires as well as your wants.

422
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,547
As for my servants,

423
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,505
for Marjorie and Jane £100.

424
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,717
"My soul shall praise the Lord
even to death,

425
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,348
and my life was drawing
near to hell beneath."

426
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:04,400
Mr. Allworthy's recovered!

427
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,818
It's over! The fever's gone!

428
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,147
He's sitting up! He's well again!

429
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,697
The squire's recovered!

430
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,196
It's over!

431
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,708
<i>It is not true that drink
changes a man's character.</i>

432
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,036
<i>It can reveal it more clearly.</i>

433
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,297
<i>The squire's recovery boughtjoy to Tom,</i>

434
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,716
<i>to his tutors, sheer disappointment.</i>

435
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,180
You have good reason for your drunkenness,
you beggarly bastard.

436
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,556
He provided well enough for you.

437
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:44,482
Do you think any such consideration
could weigh with me?

438
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,024
Damn you, Thwackum.

439
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,601
How dare you, sir!

440
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,688
And damn me
if I don't open another bottle.

441
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,202
I shall sing you a ballad
which I have entitled,

442
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,575
"Sing, Thick Thwackum,
Thy Bounty Has Flown."

443
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,580
Mr. Jones!

444
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,177
This house is in mourning
on account of the death of my dear mother.

445
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,304
Ah!

446
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,347
Oh, sir, forgive me.

447
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,969
The joy of Mr. Allworthy's recovery...

448
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,553
I had the misfortune to know
who my parents were.

449
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,185
Consequently, I'm grieved by their loss.

450
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,774
You rascal. Do you dare to insult me?

451
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,856
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
this behavior is most unseemly.

452
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,201
- Oh!
- Oh, Master Blifil!

453
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,783
Master Blifil, that vulgar animal!

454
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,415
- Blifil!
- Out with him! Out with him!

455
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,373
- Get him out!
- Oh-ho! Away we go outside!

456
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:54,301
- Let's have some wine!
- Get out! Get him out! Go on! Get him out!

457
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,510
How dare you throw me out.

458
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,764
Come on.

459
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,972
Shall we take the evening air?

460
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,736
<i>It is widely held that
too much wine will dull a man's desire.</i>

461
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,903
<i>Indeed it will, in a dull man.</i>

462
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,531
Sophie.

463
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,078
Sophie!

464
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:33,583
I'll carve her name on this tree.

465
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:41,015
Tree, do you mind if I carve
the name of my "Sophia"?

466
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,682
Big "S."

467
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,136
"Sophia."

468
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,471
Sophie, Sophie.

469
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,603
Soph... Molly.

470
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,605
Molly.

471
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,937
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly.

472
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,738
"M" for Molly.

473
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,693
Are you aimin'
to slit my throat, Squire?

474
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,078
Would you like...

475
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,409
a sip of my wine?

476
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,786
Mmm.

477
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,960
I never had a sip
of a gentleman's wine before.

478
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,674
Oh, it's very potent.

479
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,771
What are you laughing at, Tom?

480
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,479
I'm thinking of Square in your bedroom!

481
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,408
<i>To those who find
our hero's behavior startling,</i>

482
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,781
<i>the answer is simple.</i>

483
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:47,330
<i>Tom had always thought
that any woman was better than none,</i>

484
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,456
<i>while Molly never felt that one man
was quite as good as two.</i>

485
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,959
He has a wench?

486
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,459
- A wench?
- A wench?

487
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,042
- Let's go and find the wicked girl.
- Yes.

488
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,379
Mr. Jones! Mr. Jones! Mr. Jones!

489
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,429
- Who is that?
- Mr. Jones!

490
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,359
- How dare you?
- Thwackie!

491
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,186
Mr. Jones, control yourself.

492
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,443
Your unclean habit is disgraceful!

493
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,820
Oh, Mr. Jones.

494
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,573
Go away, sir! Go away, sir! Oh! Oh!

495
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,202
Oh! Mr. Jones!

496
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,954
Mr. Jones! Mr. Jones!

497
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,287
Hooray! Come on then!

498
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,088
- How dare you, sir!
- Come on!

499
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,918
Take that, you wicked fool!

500
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,969
Halt, you there!

501
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,762
Damnation to you! Stop it!

502
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,637
Stop! What's the matter with you?

503
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,059
Damnation to you!

504
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,683
You over there! Ho, there!

505
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,764
Three falling onto one? Oh!

506
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,815
Sophie!

507
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,609
Come, lass. See to Tom.

508
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,312
He's in a devilish pickle, I promise you.

509
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,402
Tom. Shh.

510
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,404
- Poor Tom. Shh.
- What... What... You...

511
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,205
- Sophie dear.
- Shh.

512
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,328
I'll fetch you some water.

513
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,829
What are you brawling about, Tom?

514
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,412
If you search the bushes,
you'll find the reason.

515
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,563
You... You liquorish dog, you!

516
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:41,771
Where is she? Where's Tom's pussy?

517
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,608
Puss, puss, puss, puss!
Where's Tom's pussy?

518
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,613
- Puss, puss, puss, puss!
- Sophie, I...

519
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,580
Puss, puss, puss!
Puss, puss, puss, puss!

520
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,827
Come. After him.

521
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,283
- Home, my girl!
- Sophie!

522
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,336
Tom! Tom! Here, come and sup with me.

523
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,664
And, gentlemen,
let us make our peace over a bottle.

524
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,751
I beg your pardon, sir, but it is no
slight matter for a man of my character

525
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,551
to be buffeted by a boy

526
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,971
just because I was trying
to bring a wanton harlot to justice.

527
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,800
The real fault lies
with Mr. Allworthy and yourself, sir.

528
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,226
If you would put the right laws
into execution,

529
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,055
you would soon rid the country
of these vermin.

530
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,811
Ha! I'd sooner rid the country of foxes!

531
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,984
Come, you, sup with me.

532
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,940
Damn me if there's nothing I won't give you
except my hounds and my favorite mare.

533
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,200
Up!

534
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,152
Away, me Slouch!

535
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:33,239
Away! Up there!

536
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,496
Away! Yea! Yes! That's a boy!

537
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,202
Let us go and tell Mr. Allworthy
how the monster has behaved.

538
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,505
No, sirs, I beg of you, let us wait.

539
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,588
A better time will come.

540
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,303
Ods zodikins!
It's me sister's coach!

541
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,852
What brings her from London?
I hope the old bitch has gone to bed.

542
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:04,277
Come, Sophie.
Sing us one of your jolly songs, my girl.

543
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,026
Please, Father. I do not feel very well.
I think I shall go to bed.

544
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,324
Not before you attend to your guest.

545
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,572
Tom here has a great thirst,
I warrant you.

546
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,155
Western, what are these nocturnal riots?

547
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,241
Now lookee here, Sister...

548
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,917
- Sophie.
- Yes, Aunt?

549
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,585
- To bed.
- Bed?

550
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,414
- Bed!
- I'd be glad to, madam.

551
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,167
Now lookee here, Sister.

552
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,754
Brother, as I am here to stay a while,

553
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,261
I shall sign a peace treaty with you.

554
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:38,183
Sister, I've often warned you
not to talk that court gibberish to me.

555
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:42,141
I pity your country ignorance
from my heart.

556
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,023
And I despise your citified claptrap.

557
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,696
I'd rather be anything than a courtier

558
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,400
or a... or a Presbyterian!

559
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:54,908
Or a crawler around
one of those damned German kings,

560
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,205
as I'm given to believe some people are.

561
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,374
Well, if you mean me,
I'm a woman of...

562
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,793
Yes, and it's a good thing for you
that you are.

563
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,213
If you were a man, I'd have lent you
a flick long ago.

564
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,667
Brother, I think you are a perfect goat.

565
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,047
Good night, sir.

566
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,220
Good night, Sister.

567
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,519
Brother!

568
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,808
Brother!

569
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,189
Brother!

570
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,821
Oh, stop.

571
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,986
Brother!

572
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,742
Hmm?

573
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,830
Brother, have you not noticed
something very extraordinary

574
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,755
about my niece Sophie lately?

575
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:51,552
Tell me then, for you know
I love that girl more than my own soul.

576
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,095
Well, unless I am deceived,

577
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,719
my niece is desperately in love.

578
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,642
In love?

579
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,145
In love? Without my consent?

580
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,851
I'll disinherit her!

581
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,111
I'll toss her out of doors, stark naked,
without a farthing!

582
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,363
Where is she?

583
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,569
Supposing she should have fixed on
the very person you would have wished.

584
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,028
No. No!

585
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:21,115
She can love whom she pleases,
but she'll marry the man I choose.

586
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,667
<i>But she has fixed on
the very person you would have wished.</i>

587
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,836
What?

588
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,663
What think you of Mr. Blifil?

589
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,551
- Young Blifil?
- Well, who else could there be?

590
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:38,348
In this rude country society,
who else is of her class?

591
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,640
'Fore George,

592
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,475
nothing could lie handier together
than Allworthy's estates and mine.

593
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,773
Come, Sister.

594
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,985
What do you advise me to do?

595
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,568
I think you should propose the match
to Mr. Allworthy...

596
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,405
immediately.

597
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,949
<i>I will propose it.</i>

598
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,331
Ah! Saddle my horse!

599
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:15,010
Well, Nephew, how do you feel
about this marriage

600
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,836
between yourself and Sophie Western?

601
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,923
I will do exactly as you wish, Uncle.

602
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,848
Oh, come, sir.

603
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:26,226
That is a cold answer when confronted
by the prospect of so beautiful a young lady.

604
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,851
My dear Uncle,

605
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:33,396
I am well aware of the many pleasures
of that noble institution, marriage,

606
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,526
and I will gladly call upon the young lady

607
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,733
at any time that she will
be pleased to receive me.

608
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,819
Good. You shall call upon her
this very afternoon.

609
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,408
Sophie, dear,
what book is that you are reading?

610
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,743
A sad one.

611
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:51,420
- You blush, my dear Sophie.
- I have no thoughts to be ashamed of.

612
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,921
Now, Sophie, you know how I love you.

613
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,593
You know the easiness of my nature.

614
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,637
I have not always been like this.

615
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,807
I used to be thought cruel.
By the men, I mean.

616
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,385
I was called the cruel Parthenissa.

617
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,937
Now come, Sophie.
I have news that will delight you.

618
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,559
News? What news, Aunt?

619
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,940
This very afternoon your father
has arranged for you to receive your lover.

620
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,655
My lover?

621
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,232
He's coming?

622
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,067
- This afternoon?
- Yes.

623
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,949
And you're to put on all your best airs.

624
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,159
Why, Aunt!

625
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,705
You almost frighten me out of my senses.

626
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,129
You will come to yourself again.
He's a charming young fellow.

627
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,673
Dear, dear Aunt.

628
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,046
I know none of such perfections.

629
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:41,596
So brave and yet so gentle.
So handsome.

630
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,389
What matters his being baseborn?

631
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,931
Baseborn? What do you mean?

632
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,559
Mr. Blifil baseborn?

633
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,560
- Mr. Blifil?
- Mr. Blifil.

634
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,186
Of whom else have we been talking?

635
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,939
Why, Mr. Jones!

636
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,565
Mr. Jones?

637
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,692
Mr. Blifil!

638
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,523
You can't be in earnest.

639
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,444
Oh, then I am
the most unhappy woman alive.

640
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,871
How can you think
of disgracing your family

641
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,074
by allying yourself to a...

642
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,252
a bastard?

643
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,830
Madam, you have extorted this from me.

644
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:18,007
Whatever were my thoughts
of that poor, unhappy Mr. Jones,

645
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,380
I had intended to carry them
to the grave.

646
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,638
I would rather follow you to that grave

647
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,637
than see you disgrace us
by such a match.

648
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,687
Yes! Yes! Yes!

649
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:35,734
No, no, no, no, no!
I will not marry that idiot!

650
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,731
To force me to do so
would be to kill me!

651
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,313
Then die and be damned.

652
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,905
Oh, damn me!

653
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,490
What a misery it is to have daughters,

654
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,917
when a man
has a good mare and dogs.

655
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,963
Tom, that pig-headed hussy
dares to refuse to marry Mr. Blifil.

656
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,632
I'll turn her penniless out of doors
if she doesn't.

657
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,677
Go to her, lad,
and see what you can do.

658
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,265
Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!

659
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,688
Sophie!

660
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,515
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

661
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,645
Sophie!

662
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,352
No! No! No, no! No!
You get... Let me...

663
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,401
- Sophie!
- Brother!

664
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,528
Brother! Brother!

665
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,945
Sophie!

666
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,702
Sophie?

667
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,743
Sophie.

668
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,874
Sophie, Sophie, shh.

669
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,752
My dearest, promise me
you won't give yourself to Blifil.

670
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:42,505
- Don't say that name to me.
- Tell me. Tell me I may hope.

671
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,299
- Tom, you must go.
- Sophie, please.

672
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,596
Or you'll be destroyed.

673
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,095
The only destruction I fear
is the loss of my Sophie.

674
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,766
I cannot part with you.

675
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:56,686
Can't I make you understand,
you country clot?

676
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,193
Tom Jones?

677
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,486
Damnation!

678
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,780
Where is he?
That parasite! That home-wrecker!

679
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,410
Where is he?

680
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,332
There they are! There!

681
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,705
Ah!

682
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:20,129
Tom, you must go. Quick, Tom, quick!

683
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,381
Run, Tom, run!

684
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,461
Tom!

685
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,800
I'll get thee, if I hang for it!

686
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,177
Tom, run!

687
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,509
- Sophie, please! Sophie!
- Run!

688
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,061
Brother, don't hurt her!

689
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,738
You there! Allworthy!

690
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,244
A fine piece of work you've done.

691
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,669
What can be the matter, Mr. Western?

692
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,463
My daughter has fallen in love
with your bastard.

693
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,542
That's what comes of trying to
bring up a bastard like a gentleman

694
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:08,299
and let him go round visiting
to nice folks' houses.

695
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,175
I'm sorry to hear you say this.

696
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,348
A pox on your sorrow.

697
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,183
I've lost my only daughter,

698
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,765
my poor Sophie, the joy of my heart.

699
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,896
Little did I think when I loved him
as a sportsman

700
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,603
that he was all the while
a- poaching after my daughter.

701
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,815
I wish you had not given him
so many opportunities with her.

702
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,947
What the devil
did she have to do with him?

703
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,121
He came a-hunting with me,
not a-courting to her.

704
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,119
What are we to do, Mr. Western?

705
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,873
Keep the rascal away from my house
until I lock the wench up.

706
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:47,797
I'll make her marry Mr. Blifil here
if it's the last thing I do. Huh?

707
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,594
I'll have no other son-in-law but you.

708
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,799
So go to her, you jolly dog, you.

709
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,805
I tell you, you shall have her.

710
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,316
And as for that son of a whore Jones,

711
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:08,613
if I catch him anywhere near my girl, I'll
qualify him to run for the gelding's plate.

712
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,366
Come on, me Slouch. Come on!

713
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,075
<i>Even the best ofhorsemen
should avoid the bottle.</i>

714
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,831
<i>However, the forces ofsobriety</i>

715
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,126
<i>were gathering in all their strength
against our hero.</i>

716
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,081
We draw your attention
to the abominable behavior of Mr. Jones.

717
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,710
He is a monster of depravity

718
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:31,715
and should be expelled
from your house this instant.

719
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,594
You let her out of her room
after I locked her in?

720
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:43,728
Women are convinced by reason,
not by force.

721
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,605
The English of which is,
I am in the wrong.

722
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:49,529
As soon as she came back
to live with you, Brother,

723
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:52,323
she imbibed these romantic notions.

724
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,948
You don't imagine, do you,
that I taught her this thing.

725
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,121
Your ignorance, Brother,

726
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,573
as the great Milton says,

727
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,159
almost subdues my patience.

728
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,204
Damn Milton!

729
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,757
If he had the impudence to be here
and say it to my face, I'd lend him a flick.

730
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,550
Oh! Come on, my girl.

731
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:17,011
He was, according to the vulgar phrase,
whistle-drunk.

732
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,968
On the very day of your utmost danger,

733
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,896
he filled the house
with riot and debauchery.

734
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,690
And he even struck Master Blifil.

735
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,984
How?

736
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,523
Did he dare strike you?

737
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,152
Oh, Uncle, I'm sure I've forgiven him
for that long ago.

738
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,823
But the same evening

739
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,323
we unluckily saw him...

740
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,321
with a girl...

741
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,990
in a manner not fit to be mentioned.

742
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,285
Mr. Thwackum advanced to rebuke him

743
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,793
when I'm sorry to say that
he fell upon the worthy man

744
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,841
and beat him outrageously.

745
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,843
Tell me, child.

746
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,173
What objection can you have
to the young gentleman?

747
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,054
A very solid objection, in my opinion.
I hate him.

748
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:05,263
Well, I have known many couples
who have entirely disliked each other

749
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,395
lead very comfortable, genteel lives.

750
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,853
Madam, I assure you,
I shall never marry a man I detest.

751
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:16,863
I still believe the young man
to have a few redeeming graces.

752
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,693
Some of the crimes you accuse him of

753
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,781
really sprang from his mistaken compassion
for the gamekeeper and his family.

754
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,366
Compassion, sir? Lust.

755
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,499
All his gifts, his so-called generosity,

756
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,548
were merely bribes
to debauch another innocent.

757
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,967
As you know, the unfortunate Molly.

758
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,466
Miss Sophie Western
will be the next to be undone.

759
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,593
All this I would have revealed long ago

760
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:43,267
had not Master Blifil begged me
to give him another chance.

761
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,486
Send him to me.

762
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,156
Tom, I have forgiven you
too often in the past

763
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,283
out of compassion for your youth

764
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,865
and in hope of your improvement.

765
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,417
You must leave my house forever.

766
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:13,791
However, I have educated you
like my own child

767
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,592
and would not turn you naked
into this world.

768
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:21,465
Here is something which will
enable you, with industry,

769
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,174
to get a good employment.

770
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,931
Good-bye, Tom.

771
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,822
- Ah, Boycett.
- Sir.

772
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,870
Good-bye, sir.

773
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,866
Stay, boy. Stay.

774
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,658
Mr. Allworthy is very sensible

775
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:08,829
of the many advantages
of binding our two estates together.

776
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,031
Indeed?

777
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,789
I had not realized that Mr. Allworthy
was so interested in questions of property.

778
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,620
Oh, he is.

779
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,080
And you?

780
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,881
I?

781
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:22,210
Well, naturally,
my attentions are set constantly

782
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:26,765
on those most blissful and sanctified
pleasures of holy matrimony.

783
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:35,231
Clandestine amours so soon, Mr. Blifil?

784
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:39,269
I pray you, Aunt, excuse me.
I feel a little faint.

785
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,941
The fox, Mr. Blifil. The fox.

786
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:49,738
Tallyho!

787
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,499
It is you who have taught her
disobedience, Brother.

788
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:59,672
You are such a boor.

789
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,124
Boar?

790
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:04,177
I am no boar. No, nor an ass.

791
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,050
Ah, more than gothic ignorance.

792
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,717
As for your manners,
they deserve a cane.

793
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,559
And yours I despise
as much as I do a fart.

794
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:21,687
And as for your niece, I'm going to
lock her up in my tower this time.

795
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,362
You'll do nothing of the sort!

796
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,360
Honor, you must promise
to keep your word.

797
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,284
I can't, madam. I'm frightened.
I can't. I'm frightened, madam.

798
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,578
Ah!

799
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,906
I got you, my girl!

800
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,207
- Help!
- Come on!

801
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,339
Come on! You won't get out this time,
I warrant you!

802
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:48,630
<i>Our hero was now
on the road to London.</i>

803
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,057
<i>His first adventure
was with a party of those men</i>

804
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:55,352
<i>whose profligate ways could be
conducted with safety</i>

805
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,771
<i>only under the protection ofred coats.</i>

806
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,737
Good day, gentlemen.
May I ask which way you're heading?

807
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,692
We're going north
to fight for the Protestant cause.

808
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,026
Against Prince Charles?

809
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,453
Ah, those damned Scots
are already on their way to England.

810
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:16,328
I've been walking all day and I'm very hungry.
May I buy something to eat and drink?

811
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,660
- Right. Give him some.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

812
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,255
- Good day, Captain.
- Good day.

813
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,378
I perceive you are a gentleman.

814
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,085
We shall be glad to welcome any such
into our company.

815
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,136
- I'd be glad to march with you.
- Good.

816
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,431
We shall be on the march in a short while.

817
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,065
<i>There comes a time when men,
in a constant state ofreadiness for war,</i>

818
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,191
<i>will slip their leash</i>

819
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,568
<i>and fight like dogs.</i>

820
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,526
Sergeant.

821
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,077
I believe...

822
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,540
that a man can fight for no nobler cause
than that of his religion.

823
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,288
Hear, hear!

824
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,745
I'd like to propose a toast
to the Protestant cause.

825
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:44,874
To the Protestant cause.

826
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,798
Smoke the prig out, Northerton.
Smoke him.

827
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,173
Sir, were you ever at the university?

828
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:55,176
Sir, so far from having been at university,
I was never at school.

829
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,848
Me neither.

830
01:04:56,935 --> 01:05:00,303
I presumed, sir, from the information
of your great learning.

831
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,895
Sir, it's as easy for a man not to have
been at school and know something

832
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,271
as it is for a man to have been at school
and know nothing.

833
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,649
Well said, young volunteer.

834
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,402
Upon my word, Northerton,
you had better let him alone,

835
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,484
or he'll prove too hard for you.

836
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,194
Uh, give us a toast, young fellow.
Fill up his cup.

837
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,779
Yes, sir.

838
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,284
I would like to propose a toast...

839
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,455
to the health, and bless the name...

840
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,041
of Miss Sophie Western.

841
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:33,094
- Sophie Western.
- Sophie Western?

842
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,546
I knew one Sophie Western.

843
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,007
Was lain with
by half the young fellows at Bath.

844
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,933
Perhaps this is the same woman.

845
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,511
Miss Western is a great lady
of fashion and fortune.

846
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,972
Aye, so she is, so she is.

847
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:48,564
Well, it's the same young lady.

848
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,566
I'll lay half a dozen of burgundy
Tom French of our regiment

849
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,693
had her in the tavern at Bridge Street.

850
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,864
Sophie Western!

851
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,661
Sir!

852
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,535
I can bear no jesting
with this lady's character.

853
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:06,164
Jesting? Damn me if I was
ever more in earnest in my life.

854
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:11,750
Tom French of our regiment had her
and her aunt together at Bath.

855
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,631
I tell you you are
the most impudent rascal on earth!

856
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:26,143
You've killed him, you swine!

857
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,735
Zounds! I was but in jest with the fellow.

858
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,113
I never heard of Miss Western before
in me life.

859
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,532
Then you deserve to be hanged.

860
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:40,032
You're under arrest.
Sergeant, take him away.

861
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,245
Arrest him.

862
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:54,209
<i>But a hero cannot be lost
until his tale is told.</i>

863
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,679
<i>For heaven be thanked,
we live in such an age</i>

864
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:02,759
<i>where no man dies for love
except upon the stage.</i>

865
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,101
I'll kill you, Northerton.

866
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,809
I'm going to kill you, Northerton!

867
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,479
Northerton.

868
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,648
Northerton.

869
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,945
Must find Northerton.

870
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,744
Must find Northerton.

871
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,796
Northerton!

872
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,636
Northerton!

873
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,473
Northerton!

874
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,261
Northerton!

875
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,392
Help!

876
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,144
Help!

877
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:54,068
The ghost walks!

878
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,218
Shh. Mama.

879
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,649
Shh, shh, shh.

880
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,572
Shh. No.

881
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,893
Come on, you. Come on. Get up.

882
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,892
I can't afford for you
to lie here idle any longer.

883
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,770
Get out, and follow
them rascally friends of yours.

884
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,147
You soldiers call yourselves gentlemen.

885
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,901
But it's we who have to pay for you
and keep you, too, for that matter.

886
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,482
What are you talking about?

887
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,364
That Lieutenant Northerton
escaped last night.

888
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,117
The rest of the company
went in pursuit after him.

889
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,620
And they very conveniently left here
without paying the bill.

890
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,075
Well, how could he have escaped?

891
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,458
His doxy arrived,
a trollop called Mrs. Waters.

892
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,880
The sentry had disappeared,
and she let him out.

893
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,208
She'll soon learn
what kind of a man he is.

894
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,385
Nothing is ever good enough
for sparks like him.

895
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,633
But when it comes to paying the bill,
that's another matter.

896
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,433
Don't worry, madam.
I will repay you handsomely.

897
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,135
Ooh.

898
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,650
Ah, sir,
a nice young gentleman like yourself

899
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,603
shouldn't want to get mixed up
with them rough soldiers.

900
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,323
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

901
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,529
I had a £500 note in my breeches pocket,
and it's gone.

902
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,113
That's a likely story.

903
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,540
- I had £500.
- You never had £500.

904
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,664
One single note of £500 I had when
I arrived here yesterday, and it's gone!

905
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,121
I should have known your kind
when you walked in here.

906
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,583
Somebody's been in this room during the night
and taken £500 out of my breeches pocket!

907
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,168
- Why don't you join them rascals?
- Was it you?

908
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,471
Did you see her take it in the night?
Somebody took the £500 out of my breeches!

909
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,890
You lying rascal!

910
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,639
Nor them cheating
redcoat friends of yours neither.

911
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,142
Go on, take your things
and get out of here quick!

912
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,312
Go on.

913
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,937
I'll set the dogs on you
if you don't hurry up!

914
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:43,612
Ya blackguard! Robbers!
The whole lot of you! You and your £500!

915
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,199
Wake up, you country stewpot!

916
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,543
Your daughter, sir!

917
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:02,589
While you've been a-lying a-bubbling here,
your daughter is gone!

918
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:08,675
Rouse yourself from this pastoral torpor.

919
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:11,890
Your daughter is gone!

920
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,228
What?

921
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,022
Come on, you lazy lot,
and take the London road.

922
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,644
Come on, me Slouch.

923
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,226
Get up.

924
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,195
Follow!

925
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,323
Are you wanting anything, madam?

926
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,875
We're tired after a long journey
and in need of some refreshment.

927
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,544
It'd be an honor to serve such a lady.
Let me help you down.

928
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:45,170
Has, by any chance, a young gentleman,
a Mr. Jones, passed this way lately?

929
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,545
Indeed he has, madam,

930
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,424
and I'm surprised that a lady like you
inquiring of the likes of him.

931
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:52,473
Brawling, thieving, and bragging about
his mistress, one Miss Sophie Western.

932
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,890
Sophie Western?

933
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,468
I'm not at all surprised, madam,
after that Molly Seagrim.

934
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,645
But I am the same Sophie Western.

935
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,269
Well, you can get out of here quick
and take your trollop with you!

936
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:03,271
Go on, get out of here.
Follow your fine friends.

937
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,648
Take your fine airs and graces
somewhere else.

938
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,730
This is a respectable house,
I'll have you know.

939
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,816
We don't want the likes of you here.

940
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:15,829
<i>Our hero's next adventure

01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,591
No! No!

945
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,633
Let her go, villain!

946
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,509
You savage!

947
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,769
Sure, I've only myself to blame

948
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:51,477
for putting my trust in a man
so unworthy of my favors.

949
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,942
No, indeed, sir.
You've already had trouble enough.

950
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,024
My nakedness might well make me ashamed,

951
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,701
and I'd go alone if it wasn't
for the need of your protection.

952
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,785
Well, then in case any prying eyes
should offend you,

953
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,493
I will walk ahead
and escort you as far as U-Upton.

954
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:28,347
<i>So Tom and Mrs. Waters,
for so the lady was called,</i>

955
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,478
<i>set out on the road to Upton.</i>

956
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,857
<i>Tom, like Orpheus
leading Eurydice out ofhell,</i>

957
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:38,816
<i>hardly daring to look back
in case the fires consumed him.</i>

958
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,397
Sophie! Sophie Western!

959
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,854
Sophie! Cousin Sophie!

960
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,655
- Look, ma'am, 'tis Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
- My cousin Harriet?

961
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,530
- The same.
- Why, so it is.

962
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,407
Cousin!

963
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,785
Harriet!

964
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,913
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to London.

965
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:35,088
That is my destination.
But why are you both on one horse indeed?

966
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:38,383
Oh, Harriet, I'm running away from home.

967
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:42,588
And I, too, running away from my husband,
Mr. Fitzpatrick,

968
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,173
who's hot on my trail, I'm sure.

969
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,350
Oh, never marry an Irishman,

970
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:50,679
particularly if he is eaten up with jealousy,
possessed of a quick temper,

971
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,890
and a mighty fool into the bargain.

972
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,770
But, Cousin,
what will you do alone in London?

973
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,068
I have a friend.

974
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,862
He has taken lodgings for me
in Curzon Street.

975
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:00,860
Cousin.

976
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,784
He's a dear, kind man
and a peer of the realm.

977
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,156
You can stay with me.

978
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,239
- Oh, may I?
- Come on.

979
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,665
- But your friend.
- Oh, he is away for a few days.

980
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,243
When he returns,
we will make other arrangements.

981
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:16,330
Now get in, Cousin.
Get in and tell me about yourself.

982
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,642
Landlady. Two rooms, please.

983
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,310
And perhaps you'd be so good
as to find this lady a gown.

984
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,515
She's been involved in an accident
and deprived of her clothes.

985
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,691
Take us to our rooms at once.

986
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,457
Where's your cat gone to?

987
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,975
<i>Heroes,
whatever high ideas we may have of them,</i>

988
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,435
<i>are mortal, not divine.</i>

989
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:24,364
<i>We are all as God made us,
and many of us much worse.</i>

990
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,541
Hmm.

991
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,305
Oh, all right, all right. I'm coming.

992
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,391
I'm coming, I said!

993
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,187
- Where's me wife?
- Who?

994
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,615
Me wife. Mrs. Fitzpatrick. Where is she?
I've come a distance to catch her.

995
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,694
- There's no Mrs. Fitzpatrick here.
- I know she's here.

996
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:01,372
I know it.
Where is that serpent-toothed siren?

997
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,791
Ah, then... Look, who's here, girl?

998
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:07,211
Tell me who's here, and I'll make you
the richest poor woman in the nation.

999
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,414
Nay, sir, there's only a gentleman,
Mr. Jones.

1000
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,500
- No lady?
- He has a Mrs. Waters with him.

1001
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,256
Waters. I'll bet she's using a false name.

1002
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:15,336
Aye?

1003
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:16,717
That cunning wench.

1004
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:20,050
By the waters of the Babylon,
I shall lay me down.

1005
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:22,932
I'll bet she's laying down
beside Mr. Jones.

1006
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,013
Show me her room.

1007
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,701
- Now, where is she?
- I'll show you in a minute.

1008
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,662
Where is that place where she lies,
that trough of desire?

1009
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:50,462
Down the end there.

1010
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:53,087
Mrs. Fitzpatrick!
Come on, Mrs. Fitzpatrick.

1011
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,668
- My husband.
- Your husband?

1012
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,469
Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Do you think I don't know his voice?

1013
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,593
Discovered, you whoreson, all right!

1014
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:02,972
Rape! Murder! Rape!

1015
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,392
- What is it, lassie?
- There's rape going on down there.

1016
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,643
Huh? Rape?

1017
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:10,601
Rape! Murder! Murder!

1018
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,232
What is all this?

1019
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:16,861
Mr. MacLachlan, dear friend,
I am rejoiced to see you here.

1020
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,782
This villain has debauched me wife.

1021
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:20,405
Your wife. What wife?

1022
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:23,034
Do I not know Mrs. Fitzpatrick very well?

1023
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,833
And can I not see that the lady in bed with
this gentleman is not your wife at all, sir?

1024
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:30,162
Rape, rape, rape, rape! Rape, rape!

1025
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,371
Rape, rape, rape!

1026
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:33,502
Bless me, girl. What's this hullabaloo?

1027
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,959
'Tis Tom Jones, madam,
in bed with Mrs. Waters

1028
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:39,012
and discovered by her husband,
an Irish gentleman, madam.

1029
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,384
Forgive me. Did you say Tom Jones?

1030
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:43,842
Yes, madam,
in bed with that trull Mrs. Waters.

1031
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,427
Betrayed.

1032
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,184
Rape!

1033
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,857
Ma'am, pray forgive my
dastardly intrusion. I...

1034
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,186
What in the devil's name
is this disturbance?

1035
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:57,772
I thought meself in a respectable inn,
but I see now it's a bawdy house.

1036
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,449
I have made a mistake.
I was looking for me wife.

1037
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,528
This set of villains burst into me room.

1038
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:06,285
I heartily ask your pardon, ma'am.
I thought you was me wife.

1039
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:10,039
Though I see no reason for a Christian
gentleman to be in a lady's bed in his shirt.

1040
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:13,621
I heard the lady's screams and ran
to her assistance from the adjoining chamber.

1041
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,377
Adjoining chamber.

1042
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:18,631
It seems, madam, I've had the good fortune
to prevent the lady from being robbed.

1043
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,428
- Robbed?
- Robbed! I shall have your blood for that, sir.

1044
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:23,552
You wild Irish lunatic!

1045
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:28,103
Come on, Sophie, dear.
We must fly before Fitzpatrick discovers me.

1046
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:31,022
Oh, come. Pull yourself together, Coz.

1047
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,441
We've got a long ride ahead of us.

1048
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,941
Help!

1049
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,172
Sophie.

1050
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:13,056
Ah, got you, you fox.
Well, the vixen can't be far away, eh?

1051
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,447
Cornered you at last, you bastard!

1052
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,617
Good-bye, madam.
I regret I must take my leave of you.

1053
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:37,831
Odsbodikins!

1054
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,462
After him! Damnation!

1055
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,769
Oh! There he is!

1056
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,849
- Miss Western!
- Oh! There's the man!

1057
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,943
Brother! Brother!

1058
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,587
Don't be dismayed, sir.

1059
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,920
She will soon be tired with her journey
and will stop in some inn.

1060
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,629
She's bound for London, I'm sure.

1061
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:28,510
Ah, damn the girl.

1062
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,388
I'm lamenting the loss
of such a fine morning for hunting.

1063
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,314
It's confounded hard to lose one
of the finest scenting days of the season.

1064
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:41,944
Whoa!

1065
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,149
Ah!

1066
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:51,117
- Ha! Come on, me Slouch!
- What are you doing?

1067
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,033
Oh!

1068
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,914
Dobson, drive on.

1069
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,790
Get on there! Get on!

1070
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:10,343
Stand and deliver.

1071
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,300
Whoa!

1072
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:15,678
What did you say, sir?

1073
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,229
Stand and deliver.

1074
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,806
Deliver?

1075
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,189
I am no traveling midwife, sir.
Deliver what?

1076
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:23,440
Stand!

1077
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:27,615
I will not stand for you, sir,
no nor for any man.

1078
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:30,739
- Madam!
- Don't you point that firearm at me, sir.

1079
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,196
Dobson, drive on.

1080
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:36,124
Get up there! Come on! Get up!

1081
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:49,888
<i>It is hard when a woman leaves
a man nothing but memories and a muff.</i>

1082
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,690
Your money or your life!

1083
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:11,067
- I only have one guinea, sir.
- Give it here.

1084
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,576
I'm afraid, as a gentleman of the road,
you cut a very poor figure.

1085
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:22,582
Be merciful, sir. I didn't mean any harm.
Truly I didn't.

1086
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:24,709
- There's no harm?
- It isn't loaded.

1087
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:28,543
- Nor it is.
- I'm not a bandit by profession, sir.

1088
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,220
Just a poor man down on his luck.

1089
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,889
Mine, sir, is a sad story.

1090
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:38,306
The start of my ruin was 20 years ago.

1091
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,639
It was all over one Tom Jones.

1092
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,224
What do you mean?

1093
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,857
At that time, I was employed
as a barber by a Mr. Allworthy.

1094
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:50,106
One day he found a baby
abandoned in his bed.

1095
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,442
I was accused of being the father.

1096
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,948
- Then your name?
- Partridge.

1097
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,947
Father!

1098
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:07,127
But I do assure you, sir,
there was no truth in the accusation.

1099
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,460
- Then who was my father?
- None of us ever discovered.

1100
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:13,137
That was the whole beginning
of my downfall.

1101
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:16,967
Mr. Partridge, how can I make up
for the suffering you've had on my account?

1102
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,518
Would you take me on as your servant, sir?

1103
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,266
My companion in misfortune.

1104
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:22,813
Oh, sir.

1105
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:25,642
Are lodgings cheap to come by in London?
I have no money.

1106
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:28,603
I know an old lady
who runs a lodging house in London.

1107
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:32,281
She was Mr. Allworthy's cook
when I was his barber. We will go there.

1108
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,529
No friend of Mr. Allworthy's
will speak to me now.

1109
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:37,282
Mrs. Miller
is one of the kindest ladies I know.

1110
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,206
Who knows?
She may yet get you back in his favor.

1111
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,895
Here, you're a lovely boy then.
Have you come to stay?

1112
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,605
Good day. Oop.

1113
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:25,243
No, no, thank you.

1114
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:44,979
<i>Desperate to find his Sophie,
Tom called on Mrs. Fitzpatrick,</i>

1115
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,773
<i>who was entertaining
a certain Lady Bellaston.</i>

1116
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,519
<i>The notorious Lady Bellaston.</i>

1117
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:55,448
It's the handsome young gentleman again,
madam, inquiring for Miss Western.

1118
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,610
You see, Bella, how persistent he is?

1119
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:02,663
His servant discovered this address,
and ever since he persecutes us.

1120
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,833
Send him away, Abigail.
Tell him Miss Western is no longer here.

1121
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,410
Yes'm.

1122
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:12,252
Bella, you must let Sophie come
and stay with you.

1123
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:14,334
My protector is coming back,

1124
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:17,215
and I fear he might take
too much interest in my cousin.

1125
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:21,219
Oh, Harriet, you can always rely on me.

1126
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,052
Your little maid is obviously in the right.

1127
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,725
He's a very pretty fellow.

1128
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,808
No wonder so many women are fond of him.

1129
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:33,482
Harriet,

1130
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:36,985
we must do what we can for Sophie.

1131
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:39,909
The girl is obviously intoxicated,

1132
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:43,033
and nothing less than ruin
will content her.

1133
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,579
I'm absolutely certain Sophie was
at Mrs. Fitzpatrick's when I called.

1134
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:50,293
Dear Mrs. Miller, what am I to do?

1135
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,498
I've no friends, no money, no introduction.
I know nothing of London.

1136
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,958
You're not to worry about the money,
Mr. Jones.

1137
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,964
You can stay here for the moment.

1138
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,545
You're very kind, Mrs. Miller.

1139
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,636
For you, Tom. It's just arrived.

1140
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:06,894
I wonder what can it be.

1141
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:09,180
What is it?

1142
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:12,604
It's an invitation to a masked ball.

1143
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:19,069
"The queen of the fairies sends you this.
Treat her favors not amiss."

1144
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,951
It's Mrs. Fitzpatrick, perhaps,
with news of my Sophie.

1145
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:25,371
Or Miss Sophie herself.

1146
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:36,541
<i>Vauxhall Gardens,
where people come to see and to be seen.</i>

1147
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:42,221
<i>In heaps they run,
some to undo and some to be undone.</i>

1148
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:15,545
It's no fun for a man like me
to be dolled up in this damned flummery.

1149
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:17,669
All folks of fashion are here.

1150
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:19,751
Sophie will be no exception.

1151
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,961
Well, show her to me,
and I'll have her arrested.

1152
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,011
Arrested?

1153
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:28,719
Do you imagine a woman of stature
can be arrested in a civilized nation?

1154
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:33,807
Hmm. A piteous civilized nation, indeed,
where women are above the law.

1155
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:37,522
Civilized nation, my trunk.

1156
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:40,446
<i>Je vous méprise de tout mon cœur.</i>

1157
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:44,321
Now, where can my niece be?

1158
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:04,929
If you engage any longer with that trollop,
I shall tell Miss Western.

1159
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:15,769
- Is Sophie here then, madam?
- Upon my honor, Miss Western is not here.

1160
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,522
Indeed, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, if you are she,

1161
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:22,980
it's a little cruel of you
to divert yourself at my expense.

1162
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,111
And do you imagine, good sir,

1163
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:31,197
I have no better regard for my cousin

1164
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,875
than to assist her in carrying on
an affair between you two...

1165
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:38,079
which must end in her ruin?

1166
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:40,005
Madam, that is the last thing I would wish.

1167
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:46,004
If the queen of the fairies
had so little regard for you and Sophie,

1168
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:49,511
she would not have appointed
to meet you here.

1169
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:57,936
Confess honestly.

1170
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:03,275
Are you used, Mr. Jones,
to make these sudden conquests?

1171
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:05,230
I am used, madam, to submit.

1172
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:08,659
If you take my heart by surprise,
the rest of my body has the right to follow.

1173
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:11,738
I hope you won't follow me.

1174
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:17,369
I protest I shall not know what to say
if you do.

1175
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:37,771
You must be a pauper
if you can't find a chair.

1176
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:39,473
Or a miser!

1177
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,794
I thought you were Mrs. Fitzpatrick.

1178
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:50,170
Fitzpatrick.

1179
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:57,135
Sir, I am unfamiliar with customs
in the country,

1180
01:36:57,228 --> 01:37:01,518
but in town it is considered impolite
to keep a lady waiting.

1181
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,156
<i>With our usualgood breeding,</i>

1182
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,866
<i>we will not follow
this particular conversation further,</i>

1183
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,293
<i>but attend results on the following day.</i>

1184
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:28,503
<i>Our hero released from Lady Bellaston
a torrent ofaffection,</i>

1185
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:30,334
<i>as well as a flood ofgifts,</i>

1186
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:33,762
<i>which he found suitably embarrassing
and quite irresistible.</i>

1187
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:37,891
- We must have you looking your best.
- Lady Bellaston, is all this...

1188
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:40,515
Isn't that what Miss Western would want?

1189
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:44,019
Come back precisely at 4:00.
I shall have news for you then.

1190
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,475
Send the bill to me, sir.

1191
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:49,653
Yes, my lady. Very good, my lady.
Good day, my lady.

1192
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:38,824
<i>How could Tom know that Sophie
was now staying here with Lady Bellaston</i>

1193
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:42,247
<i>and, being besieged
by a certain Lord Fellamar,</i>

1194
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,416
<i>a gentleman with an eye for any beauty,</i>

1195
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,789
<i>especially when a fortune was attached?</i>

1196
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:52,091
I do beg you to excuse the play,
but when may I see you again?

1197
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,917
Forgive me, my lord.

1198
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,800
I'm afraid my plans for remaining in London
are still a little uncertain.

1199
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,299
Good day, my lord.

1200
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,664
Ah... Ah...

1201
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:38,712
Oh, madam...

1202
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:41,264
- Sophie!
- Tom!

1203
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,386
I see, Sophie, you're somewhat surprised.

1204
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,734
- What are you doing here?
- I came to look for you.

1205
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:58,445
I found your pocketbook at Upton
and came to ask if I might return it.

1206
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,526
How dare you mention that place to me.

1207
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,987
Oh, Sophie, let me ask your pardon.

1208
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,618
My pardon? After what I heard at the inn?

1209
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:08,451
You cannot despise me more
than I do myself.

1210
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:15,840
I thought, Miss Western,
you were at the play.

1211
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:21,342
The play caused so violent an uproar,
I got frightened and came home,

1212
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,799
where I found this gentleman.

1213
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:28,388
He has apparently found the pocketbook
I told Your Ladyship I had lost

1214
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:30,689
and wishes to return it.

1215
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:35,019
When I do bring it, all that I ask is that I
might have the honor of presenting it in person.

1216
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:38,321
I presume, sir, you are a gentleman,

1217
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:41,275
and my doors are never shut
to people of fashion.

1218
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:43,235
Thank you, madam.

1219
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:44,820
Ladies.

1220
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,532
Your cane, sir.

1221
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:49,825
Oh.

1222
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,887
A handsome fellow.

1223
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:08,640
I don't remember
ever to have seen his face before.

1224
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,641
Nor I neither, madam.

1225
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:15,017
I suspected it was Mr. Jones himself.

1226
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:17,944
- Did Your Ladyship, indeed?
- Yes.

1227
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:20,989
I can't imagine
what put the idea into my head,

1228
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,818
for to give this fellow his due,

1229
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,278
he was very well dressed.

1230
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:30,457
I think, dear Sophie, that is not often
the case with your friend.

1231
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:33,035
I thought Your Ladyship had said
he was handsome.

1232
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:36,330
- Whom, pray?
- Mr. Jones.

1233
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:42,006
I meant, of course,
the gentleman that was with us just now.

1234
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,134
Oh, Sophie. Sophie.

1235
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:48,467
This Mr. Jones, I fear,
still runs in your head.

1236
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,762
I assure you, madam,

1237
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:55,315
Mr. Jones means no more to me
than the gentleman who has just left us.

1238
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:57,734
Forgive me teasing you.

1239
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,311
I promise...

1240
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,903
I'll never mention his name again.

1241
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,461
Take this to Lord Fellamar

1242
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:19,335
and beg him to attend to me tomorrow.

1243
01:42:19,425 --> 01:42:22,839
She is the only daughter
of a country booby squire.

1244
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,420
At the playhouse, she blazed like a star.

1245
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:30,100
The first moment I saw her,
I loved her to distraction.

1246
01:42:30,186 --> 01:42:33,896
Her father's estate
is a good £3,000 a year.

1247
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:37,520
Ooh. Then, madam,
I think it the best match in all England.

1248
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,398
Then if you like her, my lord,

1249
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:42,571
you shall have her.

1250
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:45,941
- Honor!
- A letter from my mistress, Mr. Jones.

1251
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:48,277
Upstairs?

1252
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:50,203
- Honor!
- Oh!

1253
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:51,655
- Here.
- What are you doing?

1254
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:54,116
- I told my mistress she should...
- Get behind the curtain. Don't speak.

1255
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,452
- Oh, oh!
- Shh!

1256
01:43:00,633 --> 01:43:02,499
My dear, charming Lady Bellaston.

1257
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,676
Dear? Charming?

1258
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:08,221
You've been avoiding me.
I should scold you.

1259
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:11,141
But... But I don't think I intend to.

1260
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:13,219
- Shh! There is a lady...
- A lady?

1261
01:43:13,312 --> 01:43:15,975
One of your ladies, I suppose?
Where is she?

1262
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:17,977
I- I-I...

1263
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:21,151
There is a lady in the next room
a- dying, madam.

1264
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:26,774
What scheme have you and Sophie
been plotting behind my back?

1265
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,575
- Madam, I don't understand.
- Answer me one question only.

1266
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:32,655
Have you not betrayed my honor to her?

1267
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:36,992
Am I neglected,
slighted for a country girl,

1268
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:39,369
for an idiot?

1269
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,420
- Neglected, madam?
- Hmm.

1270
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,438
Ah.

1271
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:25,002
<i>"I charge you not
to think of visiting again,"</i>

1272
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:27,755
<i>Sophie desperately wrote to Tom.</i>

1273
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:30,212
<i>"The truth will certainly be discovered.</i>

1274
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:35,392
<i>Something favorable, perhaps, may happen.</i>

1275
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,769
<i>Until then, we must be patient."</i>

1276
01:45:46,632 --> 01:45:48,123
<i>Courage, mon vieux.</i>

1277
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:56,173
Lord Fellamar is one of the most gallant
young fellows about town.

1278
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,510
Make love to you, indeed.
I only wish he would.

1279
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:03,517
You would be mad to refuse him.

1280
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:05,815
Then I shall most certainly be mad.

1281
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:08,109
<i>Entrez.</i>

1282
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:22,241
Madam, Miss Western is hardly encouraging.

1283
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:27,417
My dear lord,
you certainly need a cordial.

1284
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:29,293
Fie upon it.

1285
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:31,375
Have more resolution.

1286
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:33,505
Are you frightened by the word "rape"?

1287
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:37,676
All women love a man of spirit.

1288
01:46:37,766 --> 01:46:40,975
Remember the story of the Sabine ladies.

1289
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:44,179
I believe they made
tolerably good wives afterwards.

1290
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,899
Come this evening at 9:00.

1291
01:46:48,694 --> 01:46:51,027
I will see she is alone.

1292
01:46:53,115 --> 01:46:55,482
Oh, my dear friend,
I'm so entangled with this woman

1293
01:46:55,576 --> 01:46:57,909
that I don't know how to extricate myself.

1294
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:05,416
I know. Propose marriage to her.

1295
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:07,494
To Lady Bellaston?

1296
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:10,501
Aye, propose marriage to her,
and she'll call it off in a moment.

1297
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:12,332
You haven't a penny,

1298
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:15,134
and she'll think you're marrying her
for her wealth.

1299
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:18,509
It's very convincing for a man
in your desperate situation.

1300
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:25,679
But what if she should take me at my word?
Then I'm caught in my own trap.

1301
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,639
I promise you she won't.

1302
01:47:27,733 --> 01:47:29,816
She'll be the one to break it off.

1303
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:35,275
Lord Fellamar.

1304
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:37,949
Miss Western, it is I.

1305
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:41,236
I fear I break in upon you abruptly.

1306
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:43,993
Indeed, my lord, I am a little surprised.

1307
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:47,793
Love... Love has deprived me of all reason.

1308
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:51,747
My lord, I neither understand your words
nor your behavior.

1309
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,459
You're the most adorable,
most divine creature.

1310
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:58,670
I do assure you, my lord,
I shall not wait to hear any more of this.

1311
01:47:58,764 --> 01:48:02,132
If I were master of the world,
I would lay it at your feet.

1312
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:03,762
My lord, I beg you to stop.

1313
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:07,891
Let go my hand!
I will never see you again.

1314
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:12,101
Then, madam,
we must make the best use of this moment.

1315
01:48:12,695 --> 01:48:14,778
What do you mean?

1316
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:16,354
Oh, rape! Stop!

1317
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:19,191
I have no fear but of losing you, madam.

1318
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,116
Whoa.

1319
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:33,497
Where is she?
Damn me if I won't unkennel her now.

1320
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:41,801
- Oh, Father!
- Your father?

1321
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:44,849
Yes. And who in hell are you?

1322
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:48,056
I, sir, am Lord Fellamar,

1323
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:51,436
and I am the happy man whom I hope
you will accept as your son-in-law.

1324
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:54,768
You're a son of a whore
for all your fancy folderols.

1325
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:56,103
I resent your tone, sir.

1326
01:48:56,196 --> 01:49:00,236
Resent, me arse!
I'll teach you to father-in-law me.

1327
01:49:00,325 --> 01:49:01,987
Ooh! Ooh.

1328
01:49:02,077 --> 01:49:04,694
Father, put me down. Put me down.

1329
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:09,708
<i>"Dearest madam," Tom had carefully written,</i>

1330

<i>"I am extremely concerned for fear

1331
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:17,207

1332

1334
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:28,013
Understand this.

1335
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:32,393
I shall not receive Mr. Jones
if he calls here again.

1336
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:37,478
<i>In London, love and scandal
are considered the best sweeteners of tea.</i>

1337
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,522
I do not doubt that my niece
will welcome the favors

1338
01:49:40,616 --> 01:49:42,949
of a gentleman like Lord Fellamar.

1339
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:47,203
This Blifil is a hideous kind of fellow.

1340
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:50,623
But as you know, Bell,
all country gentlemen are.

1341
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:56,125
I don't then wonder at Sophie's infatuation
for this Jones creature.

1342
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:58,332
He's an agreeable fellow to look at.

1343
01:49:59,218 --> 01:50:01,961
Miss Western, will you believe me

1344
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:05,843
when I tell you that he has had
the audacity to make love to me?

1345
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:08,641
Oh, these men.

1346
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:11,936
I would have torn the eyes out of a prince

1347
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:14,685
if he had attempted such freedoms with me.

1348
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:19,987
Indeed, he's even gone so far
as to propose marriage to me.

1349
01:50:20,072 --> 01:50:21,563
Oh!

1350
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:27,577
What is it?

1351
01:50:30,582 --> 01:50:34,496
With your leave, Bell,
I will show this to my niece.

1352
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:38,163
Apply it to what purpose you may please.

1353
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:40,249
Uh-huh. Oh.

1354
01:50:42,427 --> 01:50:43,963
- It's from my Sophie.
- Good.

1361
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:14,449
You could try Mrs. Fitzpatrick.

1362
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:17,202
She might be able to help.

Mr. Allworthy,
what an unexpected pleasure.

1369
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:48,858
Good morning, Mrs. Miller.

1370
01:51:48,952 --> 01:51:51,114
You have come to forgive him.

1371
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:54,539
- Forgive who, Mrs. Miller?
- Dear Mr. Jones.

1372
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,617
Mr. Jones here, madam?

1373
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:59,999
No, I've come to bring my nephew,
Mr. Blifil, to London.

1374
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:24,565
She must be the most contemptible of women
who can overlook merit such as yours.

<i>An old acquaintance arrives.</i>

1376
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:44,213
I swear that dirty whore's done it now!
You wait till I get me hands on her.

1377
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:46,165
I'll break every bone in her body.

1378
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,673
Let us meet tomorrow.

1379
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:52,301
We will find a way
of easing your predicament.

1380
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:56,100
Well... Yes, tomorrow.

1381
01:52:56,895 --> 01:52:58,431
Thank you.

1382
01:53:01,441 --> 01:53:03,057
I'm very sorry.

1383
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:06,899
My dear sir, I hope there's no ill blood
remaining between us.

1384
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:09,106
Upon my soul, sir,
I don't remember your name.

1385
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:12,067
Nor I yours, but I remember your face
from the inn at Upton.

1386
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,493
Upton. Then your name is Tom Jones?

1387
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:15,865
Indeed it is, sir.

1388
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:19,825
Then you have been with me wife after all.
Well, there's that for you, you rascal.

1389
01:53:19,918 --> 01:53:24,003
And if you don't give me satisfaction
for that blow, I'll give you another.

1390
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:26,797
Fight, damn you!

1391
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:43,473
Yaaah!

1392
01:54:44,753 --> 01:54:46,244
Yaaah!

1393
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:12,986
I'm sorry, sir,
but you drew this on yourself.

1394
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:14,939
You're a liar.
You set on that gentleman to rob him.

1395
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:16,945
I was coming out of the house.

1396
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:23,782
Only to defend myself.

1397
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:26,083
- He drew his sword on me!
- Step back there.

1398
01:55:26,169 --> 01:55:29,128
What's this all about?

1399
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:31,456
He drew his sword!
What do you expect me to do?

1400
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:33,963
Stand there while he cuts me to pieces?

1401
01:55:35,429 --> 01:55:37,591
Yes, for armed robbery.

1402
01:55:37,681 --> 01:55:39,798
And you are certain the bastard
will be hanged?

1403
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:43,680
No doubt of it.
I hired these two to follow Master Jones,

1404
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:45,762
which they did with rare zeal.

1405
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:47,188
Good.

1406
01:55:47,274 --> 01:55:50,108
See that they're properly taken care of,
will you?

1407
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:52,685
I will break the news to my uncle.

1408
01:55:57,993 --> 01:56:00,861
Mr. Jones
has one of the kindest hearts I know.

1409
01:56:00,954 --> 01:56:03,162
He never mentions your name
but to praise it.

1410
01:56:03,248 --> 01:56:04,739
Uncle.

1411
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:09,331
I- I'm afraid to tell you
what has happened.

1412
01:56:10,297 --> 01:56:12,960
- It may shock you too much.
- What's the matter, Nephew?

1413
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:16,213
Your adopted son, sir, Jones...

1414
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:20,342
has proved himself to be one
of the greatest villains on earth.

1415
01:56:20,432 --> 01:56:22,048
If anyone else had called him a villain,

1416
01:56:22,142 --> 01:56:24,134
I would have thrown this boiling tea
in his face.

1417
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:26,139
Mrs. Miller!

1418
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:28,642
I know he's not without faults,

1419
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:31,315
but they're those of wildness and youth,

1420
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:33,814
and I'm sure many of us have worse.

1421
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:36,521
At least we're not in footpads, Mrs. Miller.

1422
01:56:36,615 --> 01:56:38,356
What do you mean?

1423
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,487
Mr. Jones has attacked a man.

1424
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,239
He has been sentenced to be hanged
at Tyburn.

1425
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:45,617
Nobody can save him now.

1426
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:42,087
<i>And Tom was to swing.</i>

1427
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:44,547
<i>His enemies had determined on that.</i>

1428
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:49,136
<i>So lawyer Dowling decided
to pay a call on Mr. Fitzpatrick,</i>

1429
01:57:49,229 --> 01:57:52,267
<i>and who should receive him but Mrs. Waters.</i>

1430
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:55,058
Strictly confidential.

1431
01:57:56,444 --> 01:57:58,777
I come from a most worthy gentleman,

1432
01:57:58,863 --> 01:58:02,482
whose name at the moment
I am not at liberty to divulge.

1433
01:58:02,576 --> 01:58:05,865
What does this mysterious gentleman
want of me?

1434
01:58:07,247 --> 01:58:10,411
He wants you to help him
see that justice is done,

1435
01:58:11,001 --> 01:58:14,290
to make sure that Jones
gets his just desserts.

1436
01:58:14,379 --> 01:58:18,464
For any assistance you can give him,
he is prepared to pay handsomely.

1437
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:20,086
He is?

1438
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:23,465
You interest me, sir.
What is the proposition?

1439
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:44,490
<i>Meanwhile,
faithful Partridge searched for anyone</i>

1440
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:47,740
<i>who could prove Tom's innocence
of the charge against him.</i>

1441
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:50,655
Constable.

1442
01:58:50,749 --> 01:58:52,411
Constable.

1443
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,662
Have you seen a man
with a big scar on his cheek?

1444
01:58:54,753 --> 01:58:56,494
No, can't say as I have.

1445
01:58:56,588 --> 01:58:59,547
But all the rogues in the district
haunt that tavern yonder.

1446
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:04,044
Will you accompany me?

1447
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:07,972
I don't go searching for trouble, friend.
It's easy enough to come by.

1448
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:27,695
Excuse me.

1449
01:59:27,786 --> 01:59:30,950
Are you the two gentlemen
that saw the fight with Mr. Jones?

1450
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:36,868
Tom cannot escape the gallows
unless you retract your evidence.

1451
01:59:36,961 --> 01:59:41,922
I beg you to do so, and in the meantime
I assure you, you will be rewarded.

1452
01:59:42,008 --> 01:59:45,467
Harkee, sir, everything we said was true.

1453
01:59:45,553 --> 01:59:48,967
Now, if I were you, I'd be off,
or you're gonna be the worse for it!

1454
01:59:55,063 --> 01:59:58,807
<i>Only one hope was left now,
poor Partridge thought.</i>

1455
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:00,516
<i>Fitzpatrick.</i>

1456
02:00:01,194 --> 02:00:03,652
- Now, that's better.
- Aye.

1457
02:00:03,738 --> 02:00:05,730
You'll be all right in a minute.

1458
02:00:10,453 --> 02:00:11,569
Come in.

1459
02:00:13,081 --> 02:00:15,494
Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs. Fitzpatrick.

1460
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:19,703
Well, if it isn't Mr. Partridge.

1461
02:00:19,796 --> 02:00:22,630
Jenny Jones.

1462
02:00:22,716 --> 02:00:24,548
But I'm Mrs. Waters now.

1463
02:00:24,634 --> 02:00:27,172
Well, whatever are you doing here?

1464
02:00:27,262 --> 02:00:30,380
Well, I'm a close friend of Mr. Fitzpatrick.
I'm looking after him.

1465
02:00:30,473 --> 02:00:34,763
Well, indeed, I came to see Mr. Fitzpatrick
to plead for your son.

1466
02:00:34,853 --> 02:00:36,060
My son?

1467
02:00:36,146 --> 02:00:37,853
Your son, Tom Jones.

1468
02:00:37,939 --> 02:00:40,932
He never intended to wound Mr. Fitzpatrick.

1469
02:00:41,025 --> 02:00:44,609
But I met the man
who wounded Mr. Fitzpatrick at Upton.

1470
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:48,485
Then that is the same man,
your son, Tom Jones.

1471
02:00:49,284 --> 02:00:52,777
With his own mother? With Jenny Jones?

1472
02:00:52,871 --> 02:00:54,783
How could either of them have known, sir?

1473
02:00:54,873 --> 02:00:59,914
Good heavens, in what miserable distresses
do vice and imprudence involve men.

1474
02:01:00,003 --> 02:01:02,666
Ma'am, there's a Mrs. Waters here
to see Mr. Allworthy.

1475
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:04,668
What is she doing here?

1476
02:01:04,758 --> 02:01:06,966
The very woman herself, sir.

1477
02:01:07,051 --> 02:01:08,838
You probably don't recognize me, sir.

1478
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:11,170
Indeed, you are much changed, madam.

1479
02:01:11,264 --> 02:01:13,472
But what business
can you have with me now?

1480
02:01:13,558 --> 02:01:16,676
Such business
as I can impart only to you, sir.

1481
02:01:17,687 --> 02:01:19,394
Pray, leave us.

1482
02:01:45,048 --> 02:01:47,791
This, sir, is the very man
I was telling you about.

1483
02:01:47,884 --> 02:01:50,877
- But he is my steward.
- Nevertheless, this is the man.

1484
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:53,713
- Do you know this lady?
- That lady, sir?

1485
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:57,596
Look you, Mr. Dowling, if you value my favor,
you will not hesitate but answer me truly.

1486
02:01:57,685 --> 02:01:58,892
Do you know this lady?

1487
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:01,140
I have seen her, sir.

1488
02:02:01,231 --> 02:02:05,066
Before my sister died,
did she give you a letter for me, sir?

1489
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:07,518
Come with me, sir.

1490
02:02:25,088 --> 02:02:27,751
Partridge,
have my coach brought round at once.

1491
02:02:27,841 --> 02:02:29,332
Yes, sir.

1492
02:02:31,386 --> 02:02:32,627
- Uncle, I have...
- Harkee, sir.

1493
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,712
Before I return,
you had better find the letter

1494
02:02:34,806 --> 02:02:37,765
which your mother gave to Dowling here
before she died.

1495
02:02:41,729 --> 02:02:43,766
Ah, good day, neighbor.

1496
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:45,940
Are you going to see your bastard hang?

1497
02:02:46,025 --> 02:02:49,860
On the contrary, Mr. Western.
We're going to Newgate Jail to save him.

1498
02:02:49,946 --> 02:02:51,938
Save him? Save him for what?

1499
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:54,944
And this is what Mr. Allworthy
is saying to Mr. Western.

1500
02:02:55,034 --> 02:02:57,697
"My friend, Mr. Fitzpatrick,
has now recovered

1501
02:02:57,787 --> 02:03:00,245
and is no longer
charging Tom with robbery."

1502
02:03:00,331 --> 02:03:02,618
I couldn't be more pleased
if he were me own son,

1503
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:05,076
which it may surprise you to know
he's not.

1504
02:03:05,169 --> 02:03:08,333
Mr. Allworthy's own sister Bridget,
who was Tom's mother,

1505
02:03:08,423 --> 02:03:10,915
and I, the one who put the baby
in the squire's bed.

1506
02:03:11,009 --> 02:03:13,251
And that is what it says in the letter.

1507
02:03:13,344 --> 02:03:17,384
And so, Tom is now my only heir!

1508
02:03:17,473 --> 02:03:20,011
Your heir? Did you say your heir?

1509
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:21,683
Yes, neighbor.

1510
02:03:21,769 --> 02:03:24,887
To Newgate, Goody,
and drive for dear life!

1511
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:27,314
But I always loved that boy best.

1512
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,938
He shall have my Sophie by this hand.

1513
02:03:30,028 --> 02:03:32,236
Tyburn, here I come!

1514
02:03:32,322 --> 02:03:34,109
Come on, me Slouch! Get on!

1515
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:44,248
<i>And another old acquaintance has arrived,</i>

1516
02:03:44,334 --> 02:03:46,200
<i>not only reinstated in the army,</i>

1517
02:03:46,294 --> 02:03:49,287
<i>but now in charge of the condemned.</i>

1518
02:04:02,769 --> 02:04:04,977
For your life, Goody! Faster!

1519
02:04:28,962 --> 02:04:30,578
Turnkey!

1520
02:04:31,673 --> 02:04:34,791
I have come to release a Mr. Tom Jones.

1521
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:38,002
We sent him off hours ago.
He'll be strung up by now.

1522
02:04:38,096 --> 02:04:39,587
But they can't hang him.

1523
02:04:39,681 --> 02:04:41,673
But I have just procured
this pardon for him.

1524
02:04:41,766 --> 02:04:43,348
They can't hang an innocent man.

1525
02:04:43,434 --> 02:04:45,346
They have done often enough before.

1526
02:04:45,436 --> 02:04:48,224
They won't have reached Tyburn yet.
We must stop them. Come.

1527
02:05:19,846 --> 02:05:21,462
Faster, faster, faster, Goody!

1528
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:48,163
Better luck in the next world, Mr. Jones.

1529
02:05:48,249 --> 02:05:52,084
<i>To die for a cause is a common evil.</i>

1530
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:54,787
<i>To die for nonsense is the devil.</i>

1531
02:05:56,049 --> 02:06:00,544
<i>And twould be the devil's own nonsense
to leave Tom Jones without a rescuer.</i>

1532
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:02,673
Aaah!

1533
02:06:37,882 --> 02:06:40,966
Oh, my dear boy. Forgive me.

1534
02:06:41,052 --> 02:06:42,259
Forgive you?

1535
02:06:42,345 --> 02:06:46,510
How can I ever make amends for those
unkind, unjust suspicions I have held of you?

1536
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:49,012
- You have always used me kindly.
- No, Nephew.

1537
02:06:49,102 --> 02:06:51,435
- I have used you cruelly.
- Nephew?

1538
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:54,855
Yes, you are indeed illegitimate,

1539
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:57,684
but your mother was not this lady here,

1540
02:06:57,777 --> 02:07:00,315
but my sister Bridget.

1541
02:07:00,404 --> 02:07:02,236
Uncle!

1542
02:07:02,323 --> 02:07:05,441
- It is true, Tom.
- Ah, this is no time for explanations, neighbor.

1543
02:07:05,535 --> 02:07:09,620
Tom, thou art as hearty a cock
as any in the kingdom.

1544
02:07:09,705 --> 02:07:12,288
Go on, after your mistress.

1545
02:07:12,375 --> 02:07:14,867
Alas, I fear I've sinned against her
for all time.

1546
02:07:14,961 --> 02:07:16,668
I doubt if she'll speak to me now.

1547
02:07:16,754 --> 02:07:19,838
No, Tom, don't say you have lost her yet.

1548
02:07:19,924 --> 02:07:21,540
Go to her now.

1549
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:25,552
- Go on, Tom.
- Go to her.

1550
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:27,470
Go on, lad.

1551
02:07:27,557 --> 02:07:29,048
I will!

1552
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,312
Ah, go to her lad, to her.

1553
02:07:43,406 --> 02:07:44,817
Harkee, Allworthy.

1554
02:07:44,907 --> 02:07:50,198
I'll bet thee a thousand pounds to a crown
we'll have a boy tomorrow nine months.

1555
02:07:50,288 --> 02:07:53,122
<i>Happy the man and happy he alone,</i>

1556
02:07:53,207 --> 02:07:56,371
<i>he who can call today his own.</i>

1557
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:59,077
<i>He who, secure within, can say,</i>

1558
02:07:59,172 --> 02:08:03,963
<i>"Tomorrow, do thy worst,
for I have lived today."</i>

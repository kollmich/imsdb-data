Marcus.How are you?Ask me in an hour.[WHISPERING]
I thought I'd try......one last time.You should have stayed
in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.[WHISPERING]
By signing this consent form......you'd be donating your body
to a noble cause.You'd......have a second chance,
through my research, to live again.You know what I did.My brother and two cops are dead
because of me.I'm not looking for a second chance.But I'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?Do you think
I'm gonna cure your cancer, Serena?I'm not worried about myself.I'm worried about the future
of the human race.I'll sell it to you.For what?A kiss.SERENA:
Mm.MARCUS:
Oh....So that's what death tastes like.[SERENA SIGHS][DOOR SLAMS]You're doing something very noble.MARCUS:
No, I'm guilty.Just cut me up

This mission is a quick in-and-out.Command deems the information
on those computers......to be of the highest priority.[EXHALES]BARBAROSA [ON RADIO]:
Connor, there's no sign of the machines.They're gone .DAVID [ON RADIO]:

you have to see.[GROANING AND GIBBERING]MAN 1 : Hard wall.
OLSEN: Get what we came for, Barbarosa.The clock's ticking.Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.JOHN:
Why didn't we know about this?BARBAROSA: Sir, I think this is
what Command's looking for.I'm in their source code.These people are being taken
to San Francisco.Some sort of R and D project
for a new Terminator.OLSEN:
Send it to Command.BARBAROSA:
It's uploading. I need two minutes.Wait, wait, wait.
Go back. Go back.Stop.[CHATTERING]BARBAROSA: T-800.
DAVID: A new Terminator.It's like you said it would be.-It's worse.
OLSEN: Get your nose out of that.None of your business.
You're not leading this mission.Let's cut these sorry bastards loose.
Come on. Let's go.-Jericho, come in.

That's straight from the top.[THUNDER RUMBLES]JOHN:
You open up that ramp......and you tell them I need divers for
a lock-in! Now!PILOT:
This is crazy.ASHDOWN:
John Connor.Prophesized leader
of the Resistance.Soldier, you put every man and woman
in this sub in jeopardy......with your little frogman stunt.Let's get one thing straight.I don't believe in prophecy.[GUN COCKS]Not when one can rewrite
the future in a heartbeat.Are we on the same page?Yeah, we're on the same page.Good. Good.So, soldier......what the hell are you doing here?-What did we find down there?
-You'll be briefed...-...on a need-to-know basis.
-Well, I need to know.Because my men died
down in that hole.What did we find down there?We found a solution, Connor,
that can end this war once and for all.We know the machines use shortwave
transmitters to communicate.Intel has located a hidden signal
under the primary channel.It allows for direct control
of the machines.Skynet's a machine,
and like all machines......it has an off switch.Does it work?Will it work? Yes.
Have we field tested it? No.Give it to me.I'll do it.I'll test it.Connor and his tech-comm unit
have an excellent record.ASHDOWN:
All right.All right. Huh.Take Connor topside.
Prepare for lockout.Connor, we do this right,
the war is over.We mount our offensive in four days.LOSENKO:
Connor.These are the codes for the signal.-Good luck.
-Why four days?A kill list was intercepted
from Skynet.It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.You're number two on the list.-Well, who's number one?
-An unknown. A civilian. Kyle Reese.[HELICOPTER PASSING][GATE CLINKS][CHATTERING]OLSEN [VOICE-OVER]:

Barnes.My brother,
he didn't make it, did he?SARAH [ON TAPE]: This is tape number 28
of Sarah Connor to my son, John.What's most difficult
is trying to decide ......what to tell you and what not to.Should I tell you about your father?Will it affect your decision to
send him back in time to protect me ......knowing that he is your father?And he'll be younger than you.
Only a teenager when you meet him.God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.But if you don't send Kyle,
you can never be ......and Skynet will win the war.[COMPUTER CHIRPING]KATE:
You want to talk about him?Kyle is out there somewhere alone,
and Skynet is hunting him.What about the signal?What do you think?KATE: If it works, it's incredible .
JOHN: Yeah.KATE: We have to be careful.
-I agree.-But we have to try.
KATE: Okay.All right, start with something small
that we're familiar with.We should capture a Hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.JOHN:
Yeah.What is it, John?Kill Kyle Reese, reset the future......no John Connor.[SHOUTING]
Hey![CREAKING][GRUNTING]Come with me if you wanna live.What is that?[SHOTGUN RACKS]She doesn't talk,
but you need to start.[KYLE PANTS]Where'd you get that jacket?-The other guy didn't need it.
-Oh?You see that red?It stands for blood.
It's a symbol of the Resistance.You're obviously not
a Resistance fighter, so take it off.Take it off!You point a gun at someone......you'd better be ready
to pull the trigger.Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.-What the hell was that thing?
-Terminator.T-600 .What day is it?What year?201 8.What happened here?Judgment Day happened.I gotta get out of here.You can't go on foot.
The machines will cut you down.You need speed.I need a car.Well, look, there's some
by Griffith Observatory.-They don't run though.
-Take me.[SQUEAKING]KYLE:
Get down![MARCUS COUGHS][ALL COUGHING]KYLE:
That was a Hunter-Killer.Thanks to you, they know we're here.What's your name, kid?Kyle Reese.Come on.[WHIRRING AND SQUEALING]We burned out his transmitter
so it can't talk to any of its pals.But he can still receive.Turn it on.You got it?MAN 1 :
Hold it down, hold it down.Turn the signal up.[SIGNAL BEEPING][ROBOT POWERING DOWN]Give me the strap.-Holy shit.
-Do you believe it?MAN 2: All right. Strap it tight.
WOMAN: The signal has to be continuous.If there's any interruption....[GRUNTING]JOHN [DISTORTED]:
Okay.Let's rig up a portable shortwave,
test it on something larger in the field.All right.Destroy this thing.MARCUS:
So where are the cars?KYLE:
You don't wanna go out after dark.Hunter-Killers have infrared,
hunt better at night.We'll all go tomorrow morning.MARCUS: What is that?
KYLE: Two-day-old coyote.Better than three-day-old coyote.KYLE:
Hey, hey!MARCUS:
Shhh.[SHOTGUN RACKS]MARCUS: Grab it.
-What?Grab it.Magic.[MARCUS SIGHS]MARCUS: Got it?
KYLE: Yeah.Thanks.Does this radio work?No.My dad tried to fix it,
but he could never get it to work.MARCUS:
Hold that.Where is everybody?They're gone.So why are you still here?Because we're the Resistance,
L.A. branch.Welcome to the headquarters.Resisting what?Machines. Skynet.-Just the two of you?
KYLE [WHISPERS]: Yeah.How come you're not
wearing one of these?Because I haven't earned mine yet.l hope he's listening to this.We've been fighting a long time......and we have all lost so very much,
so many loved ones gone.But you are not alone.There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.We are at the brink.Do you wanna see a magic trick?
Hold that up.Press the button.[RADIO STATIC]JOHN [ON RADIO]: Effective range of their
main weapon is less than 1 00 meters.They pack a lot of firepower,
but the T-600s are heavy and slow.They are a primitive design.-Who is that?
JOHN: If you can't outrun them...-I don't know.
-...then you have one option.Their motor cortex is partially
exposed at the back of their neck.A knife to this area will disorient
their tracking device, but not for long.Above all, stay alive.
You have no idea......how important you are ,
and how important you will become.The machines are advancing
even faster than I told you they would.I've seen it with my own eyes.They're inventing new Terminators,
new ways of killing us.Skynet is planning something big.But the Resistance
is planning something bigger.This is John Connor.If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.[SIGNAL BUZZES OFF]John Connor.We gotta find this guy.[SPARKING]MARCUS:
Ow.KYLE: So you get it working?
MARCUS: Almost.Good. Look,
I figure we head east, right?We go through the desert, then we can
connect with the Resistance there.-I'm heading north.
KYLE: No, no, no.The machines control the whole
northern sector, up to San Francisco.-That's Skynet Central.
-I have to find someone.There's a lot you don't understand
about Skynet, okay?It's just too dangerous for us
to go there.What about the L.A. branch?Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.[ENGINE STARTS][CAR STEREO

used to listen to.[STEREO CLICKS OFF]Star, get out.Don't look at me like that, Star.Out. Get out![SIGHS]KYLE: You're leaving?

between us and the machines?We bury our dead.But no one is coming to bury you.[WHIRRING]KYLE:

-We're looking for fuel.LEN:
The dark season's coming.We only got enough for ourselves.You point that gun at somebody,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.VIRGINIA:
Put your guns down, everyone.Look, we just came
to find the Resistance, that's all.LEN:
The Resistance? Ha.What a joke.
Fighting those machines is impossible.We keep our heads down,
they ignore us.They'll come for you eventually.We help you, maybe they will.These people aren't going to help you.
Let's go.VIRGINIA:
You're not going anywhere.Not until this one
gets something to eat.[BANGING ON FLOOR]Bring me a basket.Here you go.Come on.

as you, if you walk in that direction.Yeah, I've been dead a while
and I'm getting used to it.Why don't you come with me
to my base?Connor might know a way.If you have a problem
with the machines......he's definitely the guy
you wanna talk to.-How far is your base?

We are all dead!As of this moment, soldier......you are relieved of your command.You are no longer a part
of this Resistance.l didn't catch that last statement.Neither did I.This is John Connor.If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.Listen carefully.
If we attack tonight......our humanity is lost.l once knew a woman who told people
to fear the future......that the end was coming,
that all would be lost.Nobody wanted to hear her truths.
Society locked her away.That woman was Sarah Connor,
my mother.Now we know that what she
predicted has all come to pass.Command wants us
to fight like machines.They want us
to make cold, calculated decisions.But we are not machines!And if we behave like them,
then what is the point in winning?Command is going to ask you
to attack Skynet.I am asking you not to.If even one bomb drops on Skynet
before sunrise......our future will be lost.So please, stand down.
Give me the time......to protect our future that all of us......are fighting for.This is John Connor.What should I tell your men
when they find out you're gone?I'll be back.[GUNS N' ROSES,
"YOU COULD BE MINE" PLAYS]I'm coming for you.JOHN:
Come on, Marcus.MARCUS:
Kyle.[DEVICE BEEPS]Okay.Signal broadcasting
at full strength, sir.-Good. Commence bombing of Skynet.
SOLDIER: We have a green light to attack.RESISTANCE MEMBER 1 : This is Bakersfieid.
That's a no-go on your last. Out.RESISTANCE MEMBER 2:
Eugene, standing down.RESISTANCE MEMBER 3:
This is Reno. Negative on your last.SOLDIER: Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield.
They're all standing down.They will not attack
unless Connor gives the order.[POWERS DOWN][PEOPLE YELLING][YELLS]Kyle Reese?Get to the transport! Go!
Is Kyle Reese here?Welcome home, Marcus.We knew you'd be back.After all, it was programmed in you.Oh . And you executed
that programming beautifully.What am I?You are an infiltration prototype.
The only one of your kind.We resurrected you, advanced
Cyberdyne's work, amended it.You're dead.Calculations confirm Serena Kogan's
face is the easiest for you to process.We can be others if you wish.Marcus, what else could you be ......if not machine?A man.The human condition
no longer applies to you.Accept what you already know.That you were made
to serve a purpose.To achieve what no other machine
has achieved before .To infiltrate , find a target, and then
bring that target back home to us.We've been at war since
before either of us even existed.You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.You get me in.You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.-Yeah?
MARCUS: I will.[PEOPLE YELLING]JOHN: Kyle Reese! Kyle Reese!
Move! Move!Kyle Reese!Get to the transports!-Kyle Reese?
-No.[YELLS]JOHN:
You! Move!In times of desperation, people will
believe what they want to believe .And so, we gave them
what they wanted to believe.A trick, in the form of a signal the
Resistance thought would win the war.And they were right,
it will end this war.Except that it is the Resistance
that will be terminated.Not Skynet.ASHDOWN: Get the attack
on Skynet Central back online.l want our aircraft in the sky
immediately.Sir. Sir, we've got a bogey
with a very large radar signature......closing in on our position.Losenko?We have destroyed ourselves.Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.[SCREAMS]Our best machines had failed
time and again to complete a mission.Something was missing.
We had to think. Radically.And so we made you. We created
the perfect infiltration machine .You, Marcus.You did what Skynet has failed to do
for so many years.You killed John Connor.[DEVICE BEEPING][BEEPING RAPIDLY][JOHN GRUNTING]Kyle!Hey!SERENA:
Don't fight, Marcus.Remember what you are .l know what I am.[GRUNTS]I'm better this way.You will not be given
a second chance .-You cannot save John Connor.
-Watch me.[GRUNTS][ALARM WAILING]Got a message from Connor.He's in Skynet, needs air support.Let's go. Scramble aircraft![GROANS]Star! Star, go!Star!Star! Star! Come on. Come on.-What's your name?
-Kyle Reese.JOHN:
Stay with me .[GRUNTS]Back!KYLE:
Come on, Star, move! Move![GRUNTING]JOHN:
T-800s.KYLE:
There's so many of them.JOHN:
Careful.-What are these?
JOHN: Fuel cells.Life source for the T-800 .Nuclear.Enough to level this place.Cover us.[ELEVATOR BEEPS]Get ready.This is it.[GRUNTING]JOHN:
Run!Star, come on! Let's go!Get in.Come on!We gotta get to the transport.KYLE: Where are you going?
-I gotta end this.No, no. I'm not gonna leave you!-You didn't.
-Who are you?John Connor.[JOHN GROANING][YELLS][MARCUS GRUNTING][GRUNTING][MARCUS GRUNTING][YELLS][CHATTERING]KYLE: Hey! Hey, John Connor's in there .

Let's get out of here.John.BARNES: We can't make it back to base.
Set this down in the nearest safe zone.BLAIR: Medevac, urgent.
Severe chest trauma.Call the surgical team.
Remarks: it's Connor.[EKG MONITOR BEEPING]How long?His heart......can't take it.It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Kate.JOHN:
Kyle?Take it.You earned it.Kate?Take mine.BLAIR:
Marcus....Everybody deserves
a second chance.This is mine.MARCUS:
What is it that makes us human?It's not something
you can program.You can't put it into a chip.It's the strength of the human heart.The difference between us
and machines.JOHN: There is a storm on the horizon.
A time of hardship and pain.This battle has been won, but the war
against the machines rages on.Skynet's global network
remains strong.But we will not quit......until all of it is destroyed.This is John Connor.

Do you have the pages?Everyone,
keep clear of the crane.My friend,
a film needs an ending.- You do know that, right?

It's tonight.That's, like, 17 hours...Everybody, calm down, okay?I'm calm.I want you to be
happy with the movie.You understand?
I'm on your side.That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending...Is terrible.All due respect,

But you know what?You've been blowing smoke
up my ass for eight years?I guess I thought

Flow of traffic mean anything to you?What if you hydroplane?I'm not gonna hydroplane.It is my job
to assess risk.So, please trust me
when I tell youthat, statistically speaking,I am much more likely to
get into an accidentbecause I am talking
to you on the phone!All right?
I have to go.I will talk to you soon.
Goodbye.Edward Kaspbrak speaking.<i>You didn't say,
"Okay, bye, I love you,"</i><i>like you usually do.</i>Listen to me. I can't!I'm going to be

<i>- Shut up, Richie.</i>- <i>Fucking perv.</i>
<i>- Shut up, Richie.</i><i>Pussy!</i>Trashmouth. Uh...Forgot the joke.You suck!Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,for letting us
present to you today.Now, this will include
over a million square feetof commercial
and residential space.State-of-the-art
office towers.What I'm really looking for
is to understandhow we create even more
retail opportunities.If we put in walls here
and all along here...<i>Lose them.</i><i>With all due respect,
Mr. Hanscom...</i>Ben, please.
And with all due respect to you,I'm getting claustrophobicjust looking at this model.
Aren't you?Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.You know what people
want to do in prison?Get out. Right?This should be a place
that brings people together.A meeting ground.A clubhouse.<i>And if,</i>while people are there...<i>Excuse me
for one second.</i>- Hello?
<i>- Ben?</i><i>It's Mike Hanlon.
From Derry.</i>Should I just book it?You're sure you can

on your hand?</i><i>No one else remembered,
either.</i><i>Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie...</i><i>Bill.</i>Bill.You have to come back.You all do.When?Whoa.Are you okay?
What's going on?It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?I didn't want to wake
you, honey.I know this week's
been really exhausting.I just got a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.I have to go back there.It's really hard
to explain why.It's okay.You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.I trust you.Thank you.I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.I heard you.You said the name Mike.Yes, my friend.See, there was
a group of us back then,and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.You know trust is everything
in a relationship.You know
it's everything to me, right?- I know. This isn't...
- Right?What?
Like the last time?I never cheated on you.You're a bad fucking liar,Bev.You're not going anywhere,
okay?I want you to stay right here,and you're gonna show mewhat it is you're gonna
do with Mike. Okay?You're hurting me, honey.No one else is
gonna love you like me.You know that, right?I'm sorry.Don't make this
fucking harder!Don't.You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?Tell me I'm wrong!Jesus Christ.Boys.Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.Far enough, Bowers!I'm not done yet.I'm not done.
I'm not fucking done.- On your knees.

Fuck, fuck!Fucking kill them all!
Stop it!- Cuff this sorry sack of shit!
- Fuck you!Fuck you!Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrestfor the murder

That's good.What else do you remember?I am allergic to soy,anything that has egg in

funny, dickwad?What?
To, like, a woman?Fuck you, bro.Fuck you!All right. What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?There's no way
Richie's married.No, I got married.- Richie, I don't believe it.
- When?- Did you not hear this?
- No.You didn't know
I got married?- No.
- Yeah, no. Me and your momare very, very happy
right now.Yeah, very happy.- He totally fell for it!
- Thanks.Fuck you.She's very sweet.
Sometimes, she'll put her arm around me,and she'll whisper to me,
she'll go...We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.Shh.Hilarious. Hysterical.Yeah,
it's a nice watch.Wait, let's talk about the
elephant not in the room...Ben.What the fuck, man?Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.- Lost a few pounds?
- Yeah, no shit you lost- a few pounds.
- You're, like... You're hot!That's true.No, you're like
every Brazilian soccer playerwrapped up into one person.
Gorgeous.Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.Okay, okay, all right.
Please, come on.Is Stanley coming
or what?Someone save me.Stan.Stan...Stan Uris.
Stan Urine.Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a fucking pussy.He's not gonna show.Why would
Stanley save you, anyway?Was I not the one
who basicallyperformed surgery on you- after Bowers cut you up?
- Yes!Holy shit!
That's right.Please tell me you ended
up becoming a doctor, Eds.No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.Oh, that sounds
really interesting.What does that entail?Yeah, so I work for
a big insurance firm and...Fuck you, dude.
Fuck you.Was this job
invented before fun?- That's so not funny.
- It is funny.What the fuck
are you laughing at?I propose a toastto the Losers.Let's take our
shirts off and kiss!Oh!- Oh, here we go.
- Thank you.Thank you.Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?That's...
That's huge.That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.How long have
you been married?Hey, we saw your movie,- by the way.
- You did?Oh, my God!
It was so good.- Oh, my God.
- It was so scary.And the ending sucked?Yeah, it did.
I'm sorry.That's all right.What?Nothing.
This is just weird.Yeah.Just all this,
all these memories,people that I don't even
remember forgetting.I mean, it's weird, right?Now that we're all here,everything just comes back
faster and faster.I mean, all of it.Yeah.Yeah, you know,
when Mike called me, I threw up.Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.I got, like,
sick and I threw up.I feel fine now.I feel very relieved to be
here with you guys.Why is everybody
looking at me like this?When Mike called me,
I crashed my car.- Seriously?
- Yeah.Shit, man,
I hear you.I mean, my heart
was literallypounding right
out of my chest.- I thought it was only me.
- It was like pure...Fear.It's fear.
What you felt.Why did we all
feel like that, Mike?You remember something
we don't, don't you, Mike?Something happens to you
when you leave this town.The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.But me, I never left.So, yeah.I remember.I remember all of it.Pennywise.Oh, the fucking clown.- Oh, shit.
- Pennywise.Mike, you said you wanted
our help with something.What was that?There's an echo
here in Derrythat bounces back
every 27 years.What are you talking about?Hold on.
Listen, listen.We thought
we stopped It back then.We thought It
was done, but...Mike.A week ago, a man,Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.A girl, Lisa Albrecht,
the other night, went missing.All right.There've already been others,
and there will be more.I don't want to
hear about this shit.- More death. More pain.
- Calm down.Let's get another drink.Let him explain.
Let him explain.Explain it to us, Mike.That echo,we might have changed It,just like It changed us.But we didn't stop It.Because It just bounced back.We made an oath.That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.To finish It.For good.Well, that shit got dark fast.Thanks, Mike.My fortune cookie
just says "Could."They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.Mine just says "Guess."You wanna throw
that over here?What you got, Mikey?Wait, what?This is
what I'm talking about."Guess. Cut.
Not. Could. It."It's a message.No,
"Guess it could not cut."Why would it guess
it could not cut?Cut what?"Guess
it could not cut.""It" goes in front.
There."It could not guess."- It couldn't guess.
- "Could it..."No. "Could it not cut."When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?- Yeah. All right.
- Is that what it means?- Is "It" It?
- Where does this go?That's what
I'm talking about.It... It could...I don't know
what it fucking means!You fuck with
the fortune cookies, Mike?- No.
- Whoa. Let him speak, man.This is not me.
This is what It does.I need my fucking inhaler!What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?- This is not fucking funny!
- This is so not funny!- Beverly?
- This is so not funny.Why does it say Stanley?Someone else
fucking answer me!Holy shit.Holy shit.What the fuck
is that, man?Oh, my God.Whoa, whoa!Whoa!Whoa, whoa, whoa!Shit.Hey! Hey!That fortune cookie's
looking at me! Shit!I don't want to be here.
I can't fucking do this.I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!I don't wanna be here!I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!Holy shit!Hey! God damn it.Hey, Eddie!Whoa! Fuck!It's not real!This isn't real!
It's not real!It's not real!
It's not real!It's not real!
It's not real!It's not real!
It's not real!Is everything all right?Yeah, yeah.
Could we get the check?That's what
Pennywise does, right?He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.Hey, Mike.
Do you have Stan's number?Yeah.Hey, Richie.How'd you...How'd you know my name?The fun's just beginning.Right?What he said, is it...Listen.
You think this is funny?All right?Think this is
some sort of game, huh?Well, fuck you,
all right?Rich,
be careful, dude.Fuck you!
I'm not afraid of you!"The fun's just beginning."The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.- Are those your parents?
- Yeah.You want a picture?- You okay, Dean? Come on.
- I think I'm good.Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.Jesus, Richie.
You don't remember a linefrom your own show?I don't write
my own material.I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.I apologize for calling,but I'm an old friend
of your husband's.You lied to us.
That's not okay.Yeah, first words out of your
mouth should have been like,"Hey, man. You want to come
to Derry and get murdered?"'Cause then
I would have said no.Guys.Fucking entrapment, man.<i>Oh...</i><i>He passed.</i>When did it happen?<i>Yesterday.</i><i>It was horrible,
the way he died.</i><i>His wrists.</i>- In the bathtub.
- <i>In the bathtub.</i><i>I'm sorry.
I have to go.</i>We're all very
sorry, Patty.<i>Thank you.</i>Stanley.Pennywise knew.
He knew before we did.We have to stop him.
I have a plan.I got a plan.
Getting the fuck out of Dodgebefore this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.Who's with me?We made a promise
to each other.Let's un-make the promise.Richie, other people
are gonna die.Other people
die every day, man!We don't owe
this town shit!Plus, I just remembered I grew up
here, like, two hours ago.So, I'm fucking leaving.
Fuck this.I'm sorry, man,
I'm with Richie.- Eds, please.
- Listen.What? We stay,
we die, that's it?I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shit,and I'm gonna
drive to my home.I'm sorry, man. Good luck.No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!Eddie, wait!You okay?I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.- Are you coming?
- Yeah.You should have told us,
Mikey.Bill. Please, man.I'm begging you.
Please.Just listen to me, man.
Please.What are you gonna say?What could you possibly saythat would make
any kind of a difference?They're all gone.Come on.
Let me show you something.One thing. And if you want to
leave, you can leave.Just let me show you
this first. Please.Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?My mom swings
better than you!How many times
do I have to...She doesn't even play
baseball! You suck!Mommy, how much longer?Victoria,
we came to watch the game.We're gonna
watch the game.Hello, Vicky.Isn't that what
your friends call you?Vicky?How did I know that?I guess I must be
your friend, too.If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?You're not my friend.
You're scary.Why are you crying?People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.I thought if you
couldn't see my face,then maybe you'd
want to be my friend.Never mind.Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.People make fun
of me, too.They do?'Cause of this.Well, isn't that silly?That little thing?Why, I can blow
that thing right away.You could?Oh, yes!One poof and it'd be gone!You would have to get close
enough to see my face.I don't know, Vicky.No, it's okay.
I won't make fun. I promise.Promise promise?Well, okie-dokie!Just come on in
a little closer,and we'll blow it away on
the count of three!One,two...You're supposed to say three.Holy fuck.Boo!Fuck yeah!Hey, Hockstetter.Let's go!Let's get our shit and
get the fuck out of here.Did you leave
your stuff here?No, my stuff's
still in the car.- Tell me.
- Tell you what?Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.Bev. Bev.Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's...Stop.She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,but, Bev, I saw you.I heard it.
You said it first.Whatever you guys
are talking about,let's make it happen faster,
all right? We gotta go.<i>Eduardo, andale!</i>
Let's go!There's something
you're not telling us.You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.Wait, what?I can't do this.She knew how Stanley
was going to die,is that what
she just said?You can't just
walk away from this.How did you knowwhere he killed himself?Bev.Talk to me.Just talk to me.
Like we used to.Come on,
how did you know?Because I saw it.I've seen all of us die.Okay, I just got to
grab my toiletry bag,and then we can go.What'd I miss?The library?Mmm-hmm.Wow.Didn't this place
used to be bigger?Yo!
Mike, where are you going?Mike, you live here?Yeah.
Make yourself at home.- You want some water?
- Yeah, sure.You see, memory's the thing.It's the key.It's the key
to everything.If It really does want
us back here,don't you think the
smartest thing we can dois just get the hell
out of Derry?No, no, no.
It does want us back.Of course It does!But It doesn't know
I know what I know.What do you know?How to kill the shit
out of It!I've read every book.I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,everybody that would talk to
me, anyway,and that's not a long list.But it wasn't enough.I had to know
how this all started.How It started.And It started- here.
- Whoa.- What am I looking at, Mike?
- It's an artifact.Early 18th century Shokopiwah.Shoko...
How'd you get it?I found it, in the...No, no,
they gave it to me.I stole it.You stole it?- From Native Americans?
- Uh...- It's complicated.
- Yeah, it is.They helped me
on my journey.So beautiful.They showed me things.
A vision.Ow.Holy fuck.I feel kind of funky.Hot.Am I sweating?I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.Bill.They live outside of Derry.<i>Beyond It's reach.</i><i>They moved there
many years ago.</i><i>Their holy man,</i><i>their holy of holies,</i><i>he took me in.</i><i>Fed me their sacred Maturin.</i><i>I started to...
To react.</i>All living things
must abide by the lawsof the shape they inhabit.<i>While I sat there,
looking out over the valley,</i><i>I saw It arrive.</i>I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.Mike,did you put something
in my drink?It's, uh...It's a root.You...You drugged me?
You drugged me?No, it's a root
with properties.It's just a micro-dose of
what the Shokopiwah gave me...Why would you do that?...to open my eyes.I don't feel real good.I need you to look,and you'll see.I don't feel good.Open your eyes.Open your eyes.<i>They showed me the past.</i><i>Showed me the way
It appeared to them.</i><i>They showed me
their pain.</i><i>They showed me
how to stop It!</i>It's over.It's over.
You're okay.You're okay.
Did you see it?The ritual?- The Ritual of Chud?
- Yeah, I knew you...I knew you would see it.I saw the whole fucking
thing, Mike.That's how we kill It.How are we going
to do it?Everybody already
said no.But with you,they'll listen.This won't work
without all of us.Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?Yeah,
'cause I gotta be honest.That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.Every night since Derry,I've been having
these nightmares.People in pain.
People dying.People...So, you have nightmares.I have nightmares.
People, they have nightmares.But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.I've watched
every single one of us...You've seen
every single one of us what?At the place that
Stanley wound up.That's how we end.Okay, how come the rest of
us aren't seeing that shit?I mean,
what makes her so different?The Deadlights.The Deadlights.She was the only
one of usthat got caught in
the Deadlights that day.We were all
touched by It.Changed.Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.A virus.
You understand.Slowly growing.That virus,
it's been growing for 27 years.This whole time,
metastasizing.It just got to Stan
first, because...He was the weakest.Jesus Christ, Rich.Just saying what everyone
else is thinking, man.I mean,
Rich, come on.What Beverly sees,
it will come to pass.It's what'll happen to
all of us, eventually,unless we stop It.How the hell are we
supposed to do that?The Ritual of Chud.The Shokopiwah.The first ones who fought
It, they have a saying."All living things
must abide by"the laws of the
shape they inhabit."A tribal ritual?Are you fucking kidding me, man?All right,
there's gotta be another way.Okay? This thing comes
back, what, every 27 years?Let's just kick the can down
the road and do it then.Wait, we'll be 70 years
old, asshole.It doesn't
work that way.None of us make it
another 20 years,and the way it happens...So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then...We die.Horribly.Yeah, I don't need
the "horribly" part.I didn't say it.
She said it. Not me.All right, guys.
Look.I've seen
what he's talking about,and it's all true.It's the only way.If we want
this ritual to work...We have to remember.Remember what?<i>It's better
if I show you.</i><i>We don't have
much time.</i><i>His cycle
will end soon.</i><i>And once it does...</i><i>We're fucked.</i>The Barrens.This is where we came.After the rock fight.The clubhouse.You built that for us.Yeah, the hatch has got to
be around here someplace.You did.
I do remember that!- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!You okay?- What?
- Nothing, it's just...You haven't changed.It's a good thing.You know what?
I actually think the door was more likearound...Found it.I'm okay!Come down!What the dick is this?How'd you build it?When did you build it?Here and there,
I guess.It was already dug
out from something,so I just had to
reinforce the wallsand get some wood
for the roof door,and that's pretty much it.Pretty good for
my first time, huh?Now,
that's a cool feature.What happens when
you put your handon the other pillar,
professor?Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes,why we have permits.This place is a death trap.
You understand that?Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?Just so you know, I get
hurt, you are liable.And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?That's a flashlight.What is that,
a horse hitch?When do you have
horses down...Oh, this is cool.That was like,
three dollars,so be careful with that, please.I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?Yeah, okay,
can you maybe not?Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?Be awesome and have funand celebrate the magic
of the paddle-ball?Wow.Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.- I broke it?
- Yeah,you broke it
with your face.What?I'm not putting
my fucking hand down there.Oh, man.
That's so cool.Oh, my God.How do we all not
remember that this was here?Hey, Losers.Time to float.- Ahh!
- Fuck, Richie.- Dude!
- Remember when he used to saythat shit?
And he'd do that little dance.Am I the only one
who remembers this shit?Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?All right. Just trying to
add some levity to this shit.I'll go fuck myself.It smells so fucking
terrible in here.Hey, you guys?This says "Stan.""For the use
of Losers only."Bill.The fuck is this?So you don't get
spiders stuckin your hair
when you're down here.Stanley, we're not afraid
of fucking spiders.I stand corrected.That's a first.Touche.Hey, Rich,
your ten minutes are up.What are you talking about?The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.- I don't see any sign.
- Are youbeing this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.Why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement?And I remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule!I can see your vagina!Ten minutes each.Go back in
your dumb little corner!I fucked your mom!No, you didn't.
Take that back!You're awfully good at
this, new kid.You really think so?There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor.Teaches you, like,
everything about architecture.I was thinking about applying.I'll do that.I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry.Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.What's in Florida, Mike?I don't know.You know, I guess it's just a
place I always wanted to go.Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.You already act 80.You'd clean up with all the grandmas.Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?When we're older?What?Why wouldn't we be?Do any of your parents
still hang outwith their friends
from middle school?I mean, things might
be different then.We all might be different.We'll always still be friends.I don't think that just,
you know,goes away
because we get older.Yeah, Stan. Come on.You don't have
to be so...Sad.He was old
before his time.Yeah.I wonder what he was
like all grown up.Probably what he
was like as a kid.The best.Here.All right, Mike.
What are we doing here?The ritual.To perform it
requires a sacrifice.- Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.
- Wait, what?Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.I'm 5'9". It's, like,
average height in most of the world.It's not that kind of
a sacrifice, guys.Mike?The past is buried.But you're gonna have
to dig it up.Piece by piece.And these pieces,these artifacts,that's why we're here.They are
what you'll sacrifice.And since Stan
isn't here to find his...I figured we should
all be here togetherto find his artifact.I think Bill just did that.Okay, Mike, so where
do we find our tokens?Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.This is fucking stupid,
all right?Why do we need tokens?
All right?We already remember
everything.Saving Bev,
defeating It...I mean,
we're caught up!It's not everything.We fought.
But what happened after that?Before the house
on Neibolt.Think.We can't
remember, can we?See, there's more to our story.What happened that summer.And those blank spaces,like pages torn out of a book.That's what
you need to find.We need to split up.You each need to
find your artifact.Alone.
That's important.When you do,meet me
at the library tonight.Yeah,
I gotta say,statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios,we're gonna do much
better as a group.Yeah, splitting up
would be dumb, man.Okay, we gotta go together.
All right?We were together that
summer, right?No.Not that
whole summer.Take it back.Bill!You're just
a bunch of losers.Fuck off!- Fucking...
- Stop!We were all together
when we hurt It.That's why
we're still alive.Yeah? Well,
I plan to keep it that way.I bet by tomorrow,we'll all be
back together.I don't think so.Well, if we're gonna stop
It, we better be.Maybe Richie was right.Maybe we shouldn't do anything about
It, or maybe we can't.Okay, don't let them
get to you.It's a little late
for that.You should go.Before your dad sees.Yes?Sorry. I...May I help you?I thought I rang Marsh.Marsh?Alvin Marsh?My father.I grew up here.Dear,it's not for me to
tell you this,but your father
passed away.I'm so sorry.
You didn't know?We hadn't spoken
in a while.Well, won't you
come in?Let me offer you
something to drink.No, it's fine.
I have to go.It's the least
I can do.Sure. Okay.Is it like you remember?Cleaner.Well, you feel free
to look aroundwhile I get
the water boiling.Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.Don't be so polite.Today is her birthday.I can still smell
her perfume.And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.Mama was sick.You know that's why
she did what she did.She did what she didbecause she was embarrassed
to be your mother.You look like her.But you are nothing
like her.Come here.I said come here!<i>Close your eyes.</i>You know that I
would never hurt you.You know that,
don't you?I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.You'll always be my little
girl, won't you?Always."Your hair is winter fire,"January embers...<i>"My heart burns
there, too."</i>There. I do apologize.It gets so very hot
here this time of year.It's fine.Well, you feel like you
could just about die.But you know what
they say about Derry."No one who dies here
ever really dies."But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?It's good.
Strange.Strange?Oh, my.Strange, how?Oh.I had some cookies in
the oven before you came.You stay right there.I really... I shouldn't impose...
I'm gonna...No, no, no. I insist.Mrs. Kersh,
are these your family?Yes, dear.My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.And he didn't ask
for a handoutthe way that people
come in here these days.You know what he did?What did he do,
Mrs. Kersh?My father joined the circus.I was always
Daddy's little girl.What about you?Are you still
his little girl, Beverly?Are you?Mustn't lie
to our father!Help!Run, run, run.Run, run.You haven't
changed anything yet.You haven't
changed their futures.You... You haven't
saved any of them.Close your eyes, Bev.Fuck you!If you don't believe,close themand see!Come on, you.
Come on.Ken,
you little bitch...Yes!You're fucking good.<i>Game over.</i>- Ah, well, I gotta go.
- Hey!Um...How about we
go again?Play some more,
you know?Fuck you, man.Only if you want to.Dude, why are you
being weird?I'm not
your fucking boyfriend.Whoa, I...
I didn't...What the fuck's
going on here?You assholes
didn't tell meyour town is
full of little fairies.Richie fucking Tozier?What? You're trying to
bone my little cousin?Get the fuck out of
here, faggot!Fucking move!Want a kiss, Richie?It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.I think I just shit
my pants.- Canal Days Festival.
- Shit.Closing performance
is tonight.Hope to see you there, handsome.Did you miss
me, Richie?Oh, fuck!'Cause I've missed you.No one wants to play
with the clown anymore.Play a game with me,
would ya?How about <i>Street Fighter?</i>Oh, yes.
You like that one, don't you?Or maybe
Truth or Dare?Jesus.Oh, you wouldn't wantanyone to pick "truth,"
though, would ya, Richie?You wouldn't want anyone
to know what you're hiding.<i>âª I know your secret âª</i><i>âª Your dirty, little secret âª</i><i>âª Oh, I know your secret âª</i><i>âª Your dirty, little secret âª</i>Should I
tell them, Richie?This isn't happening.
This isn't real.It isn't real. It isn't happening.
It isn't real.Come back and play!Come back
and play with the clown!Whoa!- I'm so sorry. Sorry.
- Watch it, you jerk!Sorry.Oh, man!- Can I help you?
- Hi.Yeah, I want to see about the...Baseball card?The bowling ball?No, the...Banjo?Beaver?Fucking bike.You wanna use
that kind of language,take it out
in the street.I'm sorry.Can we just start over and
pretend that I just walked in?How can I help you?Thank you. Yes.
I want to buy the bike.Aren't you William
Denbrough, the writer?Yeah, that's...That's me.That bike
used to be mine.Well, it's mine now.But you're
the big author.You want it,
you can afford it.All right.
How much?$300.You can afford it.I'll get it.I guess
that's kind of a deal.You... You want me to
sign it for you?Nah.I didn't like the ending.Uh...Three big ones.- All yours.
- Uh-huh.I don't know
how fast she'll go.Been there
a lot of years.You know what,
mister?She was fast enough
to beat the devil.Come on.Yeah,
I missed you, too.Yeah!Whoo!Hi-ho, Silver!Away!Bye, Billy!I know you're
down there.I know you
can hear me.There's something
I have to know.All of the kids in this
town you could have taken,why Georgie?Say something!Why him?Why him?
Why him? Why him?Why?Because you weren't
there, Billy.Billy,
don't leave.Hello?Billy.I'm still here.Help me.Georgie.Georgie?Help me, Billy.Take my hand.Take my hand.I've got you, buddy.
Come on.He's coming.Take my hand!- I got you. Come on.
- Billy, please. He's coming.- Take my hand.
- Billy!Come on,
take my hand!I hate you!I hate you.Who are
you talking to?Move, move, move!Move! Move!You hear voices from that
sewer, you stay away from it.You hear voices
from the sewer?No.No. Just stay away
from that sewer.I only hear voices
in the tub.You know.
From the drain.What kind of voices?Kids.And other times,
like a...Like a clown?You listen to me.
You listen good.You need to
get out of this town.All right? Tell your parents.
Make up a reason.You make up a fucking lie.
I don't care what you do.Just get out of this town.
Make themnever bring you back.
Do you understand?You leave Derry and
you stay out of Derry!Do you understand me?I'm supposed to be
at the festival.Tell me you understand!I'm supposed to be
at the festival.I gotta go.Just be careful!Come on,
let's get the fuck outta here.Wake up, fat-ass.Fucking loser.Whoa.Easy. It's just me.What are you and your little
buddies up to in here?Oh. Those guys are
definitely not my buddies.No, I meant
your real friends.Joey. Jonathan.
Donnie. Danny.Oh.Are you smoking
in school?Secret hideout.Don't tell anyone.You okay, new kid?Yeah, no, I'm fine.I guess I'm just worriedthat we're not all gonna be
the same after the fight.As long as we can still hang
out, who cares?You really mean that?Well, yeah,
of course, dummy.You and me.Oh, my God!I meant as a friend.You actually thought
I could like someoneas fat and gross and
disgusting like you?No matter
how many stupid poemsyou write."Your hair is winter fire."January embers."My heart
burns there, too."That's not the real Beverly.Beverly would never
say anything like that.She'd never say that.Kiss me, fat boy.Oh, nobody wants to
kiss the fat boy.Just leave me alone.Alone?Oh, you've always
been alone.That's not true.
I have real friends.Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.They're my real friends.Kiss me as if it
were the last time.What the hell
are you doing, kid?Guys?Hey.Hey.So, what did you see
out there?Something I wish
I hadn't.So, what, we just...We kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?I hope so.
Don't you?I don't know.I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?Mmm.Come on.
There must be something fromthe past that you don't
want to forget again.I remember
being scared shitless.Cold.I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.Okay. Please forget
that moment.I remember this.I remember the boy
who wrote it for me.Not him, so much,but how he made me feel.And a kiss.It's still blurry,
but I think the longer we're here,the more I can see it.The more I can see that moment.The more
I can see...Bill.I think.I don't know.
Do you remember...Bev, um...- Move. Move.
- What's wrong?I'm leaving.What?
You can't leave, man.We split,
we all die.Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.Rich. Um...Rich.Hey, kids!
It's Burrow the Beaver!Come on down.
It's the last dayof the festival here
at Canal Days.Ahh!Asshole!Hello?Can I help you?Yeah, I called in...I had prescription
called in for Kaspbrak.Kaspbrak?It's an inhaler.Uh... Eddie Kaspbrak?Mmm-hmm.
That's me.I remember you.Yeah.- Mmm-hmm.
- How's your mom?Oh, uh...
Well, she died a few years ago.It's very sad.
It was from liver cancer.What's that?- What's what?
- That.- All right.
- Uh-huh.Okay.No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.It might not be cancer.Cancer?But it might be.You just stay here.I'll get you something.Okay.You came here for your
stinky breath pills?My breath
is fine.Thank you.That's not
what my dad said.He said you have a tumor.On your dick.But you don't
take pills for...Wait, what did
your dad say?There you go.I hope your dick
feels better.Thank you.For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.Eddie!Eddie bear!Mommy?Eddie bear!Mommy?Eddie, come help me!
Quick!Eddie!Mommy?Eddie?Eddie, help me!Quick, help me!Mommy?Eddie bear,
come help me, quick!Eddie?The fuck
is she doing here?What is taking you
so long?I don't know.
Why are you here?Mommy!He's coming!
You gotta get me outta here!- Who's coming?
- Eddie.What the fuck is that?- Mommy.
- You gotta get me outta here.He's coming!He's gonna kill me!
Eddie!Help! Please, help me!
He's going to infect me!Eddie! He's gonna infect me!
Eddie!Help me!Help me, Eddie!
He's coming, Eddie!Eddie, hurry!He's gonna infect me, Eddie!Oh, my God!
Eddie!Hurry up, Eddie!Eddie!- I can't do it!
- Eddie! Eddie!I'm sorry, I can't do it.I knew you would leave me, Eddie!Eddie, help me!Eddie!What's all this shit
doing here?Why is that curtain
still here?Okay, all right.Are you gonna
do this, Eds?It's just a memory.It's just a memory.
You're fine.Deep breath.
Deep breath.Okay.
You gonna do it?Shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!Stop! Stop!That's right!Fuck you!Fuck you!What the fuck?What?Push, don't pull,
you moron.Oh. Thanks.Oh, my God.
What happened to you?Nothing. I'm fine.I'm fine.
Everything's fine.Hey, how you doing?
Where's everybody else?Richie wants to leave.Ben's upstairs
trying to get him to stay.Eddie's just scared.So am I, Bill.Aren't you?We're all scared.That's what worries me.Because that's
what It wants.We can do this,but we have
to stick together.Should we be running?This is Derry.
I'm kinda getting used to it.What does that mean?Shit. It's the kid.What?It's the kid
from the place.The Chinese place.I saw him
on the way here.He lives
at my old house.He was going to the fair, and...He's going to the fair.
I gotta help him.Okay, okay. Listen to me.
We'll go together.I'm gonna get Richie
and Ben and we'll go.There's no time.
I can't let it happen again.What happened before
wasn't your fault.None of it was.I wish
that were true, Bev.Bill! Bev!- What is this? What happened?
- Uh...Did Bill just leave?I couldn't stop him.Everybody's leaving.It's all right. It's Bill.
He'll be back.He'll come back.Well, at least
I got Richie to stay.Fuck. Oh.Oh. And then the leper,
he threw up all over me."Hey, it's Mike Hanlon."Why don't you
come back to Maine?"It's your time, Eddie.What?Why?Why did you do that?Because he says
it's your time.Who says it's my time?You know, Eddie.You know.Time to float.Where did he go?Now give me back
my fucking knife!You should cut
that fucking mullet.It's been, like,
30 years, man.Guys!Oh, shit.Eds?Jesus, Eds.
What the hell?- Bowers is in my room.
- Oh, my...- Is it bad?
- No.<i>I'm gonna
carve my whole name</i><i>onto this cottage cheese!</i>One down!Fuck yeah!Hey!Hey, kid! Kid!Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.Hey!Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Hey!Whoa, whoa, whoa!Fuck.Fuck!Kid! Hey, kid!Fuck.Kid?Fuck.Kid?Hey!Kid.Kid? Hey! Hey!Kid!Fuck.Shit.Hey.What are you
doing here?Hey.No, I'm here to
help.Stop following me!I'm gonna get you
out of here.No.Please.Ah.I'm here this time.
Just take me.Son of a bitch!Help!Help!Help!I should go back there.
I just fuckingleft them in the lurch, man.
I should go back there.What the fuck are you talking about?
Fuck that.Fuck them.I got dates
in fucking Reno, man.<i>Reflecting
on the meaning of</i><i>what I just read,</i>the word <i>"Leshanot"</i>
comes up a lot,which means "to
change, to transform."Which makes sense,
I guess,because today I'm
supposed to become a man.<i>It's funny, though.</i><i>Everyone, I think,
has some memories</i><i>they're prouder of

The one that set that fire.<i>...the nightmares we most

any different.I know I'm a loser.And no matter what,I always fucking will be.Thanks for showing up,
Stanley.<i>Mike! Help!</i>Help us!- Please, Mikey, get help!
- Help us!Please, Mikey,
get help!Mikey!You should
have burned, Mike.Just like
your druggie parents.Can you see them yet?Crisping?Like fried fucking...I guess you could say
that was long overdue.Get it?
'Cause we're in a library.No.Oh...Mike?- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, my God.Are you all right?No, I'm not all right.
I just fucking killed a guy.I was talking to Mike.Where's Bill?Bill, we're all
at the library.Where are you at?He took a little
kid, Mike.He took a little kid right
in fucking front of me.No, no, no, no, no.
Just, just...Look, just come here
to the library.We can talk about
the plan.- I'm gonna go kill It.
- <i>No, no, no.</i>I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.<i>Bill! Bill!</i>He's going
to fight It alone.- What?
- Alone.It's about the group.The ritual doesn't work
without the group.Doing it together
is why it'd work.Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?If he really wanted
to kill Pennywise,there's only one place
he'll go.The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.Oh, we're not gonna like
this, are we?Fuck.Bill!No, no,
you guys, no!I started all this.It's my fault that
you're all here.This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside you all.It started growing
the daythat I made you go
down to the Barrensbecause all I cared about
was finding Georgie.Now, I'm gonna
go in there,and I don't know
what's gonna happen,but I can't ask you
to do this.Well,we're not asking you,
either.- Bev...
- We didn'tdo it alone
then, Bill,so we're not gonna
do this alone now.Losers stick together.So, does somebody
want to say something?Richie said it best
when we were here last.I did?- "I don't want to die"?
- Not that."You're lucky we're
not measuring dicks"?No."Let's kill
this fucking clown"?Let's kill this
fucking clown.Hmm.Well, I love what he's
done with the place.Beep-beep, Richie.All right.Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?Ben?No, no!
Hey, hey! Ben!Ben!Ben? What's wrong?- Ben!
- Okay. All right.Ben!Okay, that can't
be good, right?Help! Hey!Ugh!It's Stan.It can't
be real.Oh!Oh, God.Shit.I'd still be alive if
it wasn't for you, Bill.No.Beverly!Richie, what's happening to me?You gotta be
fucking kidding.Fuck!Oh, God damn it, get it away from me.
Oh, God!Whoa, whoa!Eddie.Hey. Are you okay?I'm...Oh, there he is.Get it off of me!Get it off of me!Richie!- Richie!
- Richie! Hey!- Get it off of me!
- I wanna go home.Get the knife!God damn it, Eddie,
get the knife!Bill! Get it off of me, Bill!
Quick!Eddie, get the knife!Ahh! Fuck!What?Is everybody okay?You all right?He could have
fucking died, man.You know that, right?I can't see.Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.You want Richie, too?
You want Richie, too?I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.Please don't
be mad, Bill.I was just scared.That's what
he wants, right?Don't give it to him.A lot of memories, huh?All bad.Oh, man.Blech. Gray water.Shit. This is it.This is where
it happened.No, no, no.No. Ugh!Bevvie.Bev, what is it?I thought
I heard something.Bev!Time to sink!Bev!Guys.Okay, guys.
Come on.Hey, guys.Guys, come on.
Please, come on.I don't want to walk
out of here alone.You okay?I feel like crying.Mike. Where do we go from here?In the depths
is where It crept.In the beneath,
to find belief.In the depths
is where It crept.In the beneath,
to find belief.Is he okay?I think at this point,
that's a relative question.What's on
the other side?I don't know.
No one does.Whoa,
whoa, whoa!Mike.- Mike, don't.
- All right.- See you down there.
- Mike!Wait!- Stay together.
- Okay.You guys,
I can't do it.I can't.
You saw what happened up there.I was gonna
let you die.I just fucking
froze up.If you let me go
down there with you,I'm gonna get us all killed.Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.- Give me that.
- Richie.Let go,
you little turd.Just let me get...- I got it.
- Stop.Listen to me.You had a moment.
Fine.But who killed a psychotic
clown before he was 14?Me.Who stabbed Bowers
with a knifehe pulled out
of his own face?Also me.Who married a woman 10
times his own body mass?- Me.
- Yeah.You're braver
than you think.All right.
Thanks, Rich.- Ow.
- Sorry.Hey.
Here.Take it.It kills monsters.- Does it?
- Yeah.If you believe
it does.Thanks, Bev.You guys good?Yeah.Can you get through that?It's the only way.
This way.It's in here!Through here.It's tight,
but we can get through.This is where It hid.So, all this has been under
Derry, like, forever?Not forever.Just a few million years.It can only be
attacked in its true form.The ritual
will show us that.And what is
It's true form?I hope it's a puppy.Like a Pomeranian or...I'll shut up.It's light.A light that must be
snuffed out by darkness.Your artifacts.Place them in the fire.The past must
burn with the present.This is the boat
that I builtwith Georgie.It's my inhaler.Come on, dude.Something that
I wish I had held on to.This is a page
from my yearbook.That only
one person signed.I probably should

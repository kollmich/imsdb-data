<i>NARRATOR:
No one would have believed</i><i>in the early years
of the 21 st century...</i><i>...that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own...</i><i>...that as men busied themselves
about their various concerns...</i><i>...they observed and studied...</i><i>...the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinise</i><i>the creatures that swarm
and multiply in a drop of water.</i><i>With infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe...</i><i>...confident of our empire
over this world.</i><i>Yet across the gulf of space,</i><i>intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic...</i><i>...regarded our planet
with envious eyes...</i><i>...and slowly and surely...</i><i>...drew their plans against us.</i>[CLANGING]MAN 1: Tell him to send it over

without precedent.I mean, it's not like
the old days when it was a man's world.However,I suppose there has to be a first time.Mr. Chairman, sir.
I don't think Miss Bianca should go.It could be dangerous.I mean, anything could happen to her.You see, dear lady,
before our janitor interrupted,(CLEARS THROAT)I was about to suggestthat you should have
a co-agent go with you.Gentlemen, who will volunteer?(CHUCKLING) Gentlemen,this is indeed a most
difficult decision to make.I choose Mr. Bernardto be my co-agent.(STAMMERING) Me?
That's really very...No, see, I'm only a janitor.Oh, come on.

in the middle of the night,wouldn't you be grumpy, too?(CHUCKLING)I didn't wake him up
in the middle of the night.I was walking through the thing,
and I just...All right. I'll take a look around,see what I can find.BERNARD: Psst! Psst!Psst!Miss Bianca, over here.
I found somethin'.These are Penny's belongings.Good work.
Now we're getting somewhere.BIANCA: Oh, look!
The little girl's treasures.BERNARD: Boy, the things kids collect.BIANCA: Do you think she could
be still here in the orphanage?BERNARD: Well, she can't be. It says
on the box, "Hold until further notice."BIANCA: Well,
maybe she's been adopted.BERNARD: No, because she would
have taken these things with her.- Mice!
- BOTH: Cat!Now lookee here, you two.If folks find out
that mice moved in here,I'll get kicked out, lose my job.Don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.I am a mite too old to be chasin' mice.Sir, could you tell us what
happened to a little girl named Penny?(MUMBLING)I sure can.But you ain't gonna find her
around here.See, poor little thing ran away.When was the last time
you saw Penny?Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.Let's see, now.The last time I saw her,she was sittin' over there
on her bed all alone.She looked awful sad.And so I asked her...What's wrong, Penny, honey?- Nothing.
- Come on now. Come on.No secrets. You tell old Rufus, huh?Well, it was adoption day
at the orphanage.- What happened?
- A man and a lady came,and looked at me, but they
choosed a little redheaded girl.She was prettier than me.Oh!She couldn't be!You listen to me, darlin'.You're something extra special.No, I'm not.Why, someday a mama and a papa
will come to the orphanagelookin' for a pretty little girl just like you.- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.But you've got to believe it.
Keep the faith, sweetheart.Do you see that bluebird?- Yes, I do.
- Well,faith is a bluebird you see from afar.It's for real and as sure
as the first evening star.You can't touch it or buy it
or wrap it up tight,but it's there just the same,
making things turn out right.Can't touch it or buy it

or we'll be late for supper!She seemed happy enough, but the
next thing I heard, Penny was gone.Well, aren't the police
still looking for her?No. No, no.
No, they gave up weeks ago.This is terrible. That poor little girl.I just can't believe
that Penny would run away.Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now there must be something else.Well,come to think of it, there was.No. It's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.Get in what? With who?A weird lady tried to give Penny a ride,but she wouldn't have anything
to do with trashy people like them.Trashy people? Who?Well, she and her partner run
a sleazy pawn shop down the street.Miss Bianca, we must
go down there and investigate.Suit yourself, but you'd be
wastin' your time goin' down there.She could be in real trouble.We gotta find her and help her.(LAUGHING) Yeah, but two little mice.What can you do?(CLOCK TICKING)(TICKING CONTINUES)(WHISPERING) Bernard!A child's book.It's Penny's!Then she's gotta be here.(CUCKOOING)(LAUGHING)What's so funny?BIANCA: Your tail.Here, here.

patrolling the island.They let her get away.Ha!My precious pets.We know who caught that ungrateful
little brat, don't we?SNOOPS: Well, it was your brilliant idea
to use the little girl for this caper.- If you had left it to me...
- MEDUSA: Snoops, you're not thinking.SNOOPS: No, I know, I know.She's the only one small enough
to squeeze down the black hole.MEDUSA: Yes, but why can't she find
my big diamond?SNOOPS: I don't know,
but just look at these beautiesthat she brought up from the cave.They'll sell for a lot of cold cash.SNOOPS: Ow!I wish you wouldn't do that!She's insane. Utterly mad.I want that diamond.I've got to have the Devil's Eye.You didn't leave the girl
down in the cave long enough.She won't take orders.You are too soft.But the water was rising,
and the tide was coming inand all she did down there was fuss
about her teddy bear getting wet.Snoops, you don't have a way
with children.You must gain their confidence,make them like you.Yeah? How do you do that?You force them to like you, idiot!At the next low tide,I'm going to put her down there myself,and keep her thereuntil she finds it,and it is as simple as that.It's as simple as that, is it?Well, you're the boss, boss.Yes.(SINGING) Now come along, pets(HUMMING)We gotta get Penny out of here tonight.Hmm?(SNIFFING)Uh-oh.- Bianca, they smell your perfume.

Our bottle worked!Didn't you bring
somebody big with you?Like the police?No. There's just the two of us.But if the three of us work together
and we have a little faith...That's what Rufus said,"Faith makes things turn out right."Penny, I know it's late, but we have to
escape tonight. Right now.But I just got caught
by Brutus and Nero.Look what they did to my pants!Yeah, and they're still down there
guarding the gangplank.Oh, those vicious monsters!They ought to be locked up in a cage.I know! I know! Come on. I'll show you.- See there? The elevator.
- BIANCA: It's a perfect cage, Penny.Great idea.Now, what can we use for bait?They'll eat anything.- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it!My perfume. Remember?They'll follow the scent
right into the elevator.And I'll slam the door.And will that make Medusa mad.Brutus! Nero!Did you let that little brat escape again?You're too soft.Wap! Wap!(CHUCKLING)Hey, Penny, that's not bad.That's exactly like Medusa.Track her down, boys. Bring her back.And we'll be so far ahead,
they'll never catch us.Wait a minute. She might catch us
in her swamp-mobile.We'll swipe it!
I've always wanted to drive it.(IMITATING ENGINE)What if Medusa wakes up
while we're starting it? We're in trouble.We gotta stall 'em somehow.How about Mr. Snoops' fireworks?We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That'll keep her busy.Bernard, it's so exciting.Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.(CHUCKLES)It's just got to work.It's our only chance.
But we're gonna need help.MEDUSA: Snoops! Snoops!
Get down here!What's up, Medusa? What's goin' on?MEDUSA: Oh, shut up!- High tide or not...

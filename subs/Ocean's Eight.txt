(DOOR OPENS)(DOOR CLOSES)PAROLE BOARD OFFICER:
Good afternoon, Miss Ocean.Hi.As you know,
parole is a privilege.And one of the restrictions
on any parolee,is to avoid the companyof any person who has
a criminal record of any kind.That would include
most of your extended family.Yeah, that's obviously
not something I'm proud of.Would this pose an impossible
challenge for you?No. No.I don't want that life.
I never wanted that life.My brother, um...May he rest in peace,was a criminal.I loved him,but he was a conman.It was in his blood.- And it's not in your blood?
- No.No, sir.Um...I fell for the wrong person.It was a mistake.Uh...But it happened.And if I were to be released,
I would, um...Sorry.(VOICE BREAKING)
Wow, just saying that...(EXHALES HEAVILY)If I were to be released,
(CLEARS THROAT)I would just want
the simple life.I just wanna hold down a job,make some friends,go for a walk after work
in the fresh airand pay my bills.(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT
ON PA)Simple life?Nice one.- Heard about that?
- Who didn't?I had five years
to rehearse it.- Here's your stuff.
- Thank you.DINA: Nice watch.DEBBIE: It's my brother's.
DINA: Left it to you?I stole it.It's fine, Dina.
He stole it, too.So we're still gonna get
a regular shipment next week.You take your cut, plus
a few extra cartons, okay?I want you to trade 'em,
not smoke 'em.DINA: <i>So where you going?</i>DEBBIE:
<i>Well, I have 45 bucks, Dina.</i><i>I can go anywhere I want.</i>(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)(INDISTINCT CHATTER)Hi, I'd like to return these.Oh, of course.
Do you have your receipt?No, but they're unopened.
They haven't been touched.I really need your receipt.They are sealed.
They are brand new.(SIGHS) Do you have
the credit card that you used?This is ridiculous!
I bought these last week.Ma'am, you can try client
services on the sixth floor.You know what? Never mind.
I'll just keep 'em.Jesus.Can I at least get a bag?Sure.Thank you.Hi. I'm checking out
of room 2814. Gary Randall.- Did you have a pleasant stay?
- Terrific.My name is Monica.Is there anything else
I can do for you?Or arrange transportation?GARY: I think we're all set.DEBBIE: <i>Hi,
this is Mrs. Randall.</i><i>We just checked out
of room 2814.</i><i>May I speak
with Monica, please?</i>- <i>This is she.</i>
- Hi, Monica.- Hi.
- Hi.Uh, we just found out
our flight was canceled.- Oh, no!
- I know, I know.And instead of stayingin some
horrible airport hotel,we were hoping that maybewe could get
our original room back?Yeah, we can give you
that same room back.That would be amazing!
Thank you so much!<i>Um, we're just
gonna go grab a bite.</i><i>Would it be possible
to get the maid in there now?</i>MONICA: <i>Yes, absolutely.</i>DEBBIE: <i>Perfect.
We really appreciate it.</i>MONICA: <i>It's not a problem.</i>DEBBIE: <i>Thank you so much.
We'll see you soon.</i>DEBBIE: Hi.I'm so sorry.
Can you finish up later?I just have
to get off my feet.- Of course.
- Thank you so much.- Have a great day.
- You, too!Bye-bye.(SIGHS)(POP MUSIC PLAYING)JUDGE JUDY: (ON TV)
<i>And he did not move in!</i><i>And he wants his money back.</i><i>And he gets his money back.</i><i>If you said no, does that mean
you didn't take the money?</i>What crate are you on?APRIL: 15.JUDGE JUDY: <i>Listen.</i><i>You think I like you?
You think I believe you?</i><i>You think I trust anything
that you're saying?</i><i>The answer is absolutely not.</i>Guys, it's 9:30.(JUDGE JUDY CONTINUES
INDISTINCTLY ON TV)It's too much.
It's too much.It's three fingers
from the top.Not one, it's three.It's a rerun, April.She slept with her cousin,
crashed the car.The baby's not his.What's that taste like?(EXHALES) Vodka.Vodka. Exactly.
But I don't want vodka.I want vodka and water.- And do you wanna know why?
- Uh, sure.'Cause when you're drunk,
it tastes like vodka.- Right.
- BOTH: Right.<i>I don't care!</i>(LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)(CELL PHONE CHIMES)LOU: Oh, missed you, too.You better be in there.(MAN COUGHING)(CLICKS TONGUE)I know you're there, Reuben.You can come on out.I was just paying my respects.From around the corner?What are you doing here?They thought I'd be
the best one to talk to you.Hmm. Gotta go.He didn't want you
to do this, Deborah.Do what?Whatever it is he wouldn't
tell us you're gonna do.- Look, Deb.
- Mmm.Sometimes, just knowing
the job will workis satisfaction enough.You don't actually
gotta do it.What else did he say?- He said it was brilliant.
- Oh, okay.And that you would probably
end up back in prison.I'm not gonna end up
back in prison.Okay?(CAR HORN HONKING)(SOFTLY) I gotta go.Be careful.You're looking sharp.(THUNDER RUMBLING)- LOU: Mmm!
- Hey, hey! Take it easy.Been in the slammer.Oh, I just thought
you changed your number.DEBBIE: Did you
get the credit line?- Not yet.
- Why not?Because I don't know
what it's for.(SOFTLY) Oh, my God!LOU: Don't do that.- Do what?
- (SIGHING)That would be my "I've just
been in jail for five years,"and my partner
lets me down" face.Hey, I'm not your partner.
Yet.DEBBIE: This is nice.Chain-link, barb wire.Brought you something.Oh, um...Can I exchange
something you stole?Well, if you're gonna
have a problem with stealing,you're not gonna like
the rest of this conversation.- What, we're gonna shoplift?
- Maybe.No. See, this is what you do.You make me guess and then,
I'm interested.- Okay.
- And then you think becauseI'm interested,
that I wanna do it.Don't you wanna do things
you're interested in?I'm interested
in brain surgery.Well, we know
that's not gonna happen.(SIGHS) Whatever.
You don't wanna tell me...- (SIGHS)
- It's jewels.Spectacular,
great, big, blingy,big old Liz Taylor jewels,that are locked in a vault
50 feet underground.How do we get them
out of the vault?They're gonna bring 'em to us.Oh, bugger!- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Oh.Nice place.LOU: Try heating it.There's a room
for you upstairs.Your stuff's upstairs, too.You know,
I borrowed some shit.Figured you weren't using it.(UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)(INDISTINCT CHATTER)(INDISTINCT CHATTER)CARA: So,
is this your gallery?- Yeah, one of them.
- Hmm.Where are the others?Well, I'm opening
one in London.Got plans
for another one in Tokyo.We're talking about LA,but I'm not sure
that makes sense.It's all a bit derivative
out there, you know?(CHUCKLES) So this is
the only one that exists?Well... Physically.Excuse me one second.Sorry. Sorry.(CHUCKLES) Oh, my God.I was meaning to call you.Jesus, it's great to see you.
You look...Recently incarcerated?Wonderful. You look wonderful.- (CLAUDE GRUNTS)
- Do you know what a shiv is?Okay, stop. Just stop.Oh, such a nice face.You know, inside,you're what we call
a pretty girl.- I'll call the police.
- Okay.Do you know what we do
with snitches?LOU: <i>He saw you?</i>
DEBBIE: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>LOU: <i>Why would you
do something like that?</i>Closure?Bullshit!Jesus!(DEBBIE CHUCKLES)So did you...No.Just a little button.(LAUGHING)DEBBIE: <i>So at first, I thought
banks. 'Cause you know...</i>LOU: <i>That's where
they have money?</i>DEBBIE: <i>Exactly.
But that's kind of boring.</i>So then I thought ten banks.Then I realized
that would be maybecoming from
an angry place so...LOU: Good you realized that.DEBBIE: Yes. Then I couldn't
even hear myself think.You know,
five women in one cell.So I got myself
thrown in solitaryfor a little peace and quiet,and that's where
I finally came up with it.- It's still a museum.
- So?So, it's not like
robbing a liquor store.(SPEAKING WITH MOUTH FULL)I'm sorry,
I don't speak Ukrainian.I said, "We're
not robbing a museum."We're robbing someone
in a museum.In a museum.Yeah, you mentioned.Look.- Even if this was possible...
- It is possible.Even if it was,
we'd need, like,20 people
and half a million dollars.Seven.Seven million?Seven people and 20 grand.Why do you need to do this?Because it's what I'm good at.Uh, yeah.You know what?I have run this thing
a thousand times.Every time I got caught,
I fixed it.And in three years, I wasn't
getting caught anymore.By the time I was paroled,
it was running like clockwork.Perfectly.And you were there with me,
every step of the way.Oh, honey, is this a proposal?Baby, I don't have
a diamond yet.Come on. Do you
really wanna spend the restof your life
watering down well vodka?Because it's really
kind of a waste.Come on. Take a bite.(SOFTLY) Just take a bite.- You're really irritating.
- Open.That's good.Very good.DEBBIE: <i>So each year they host</i><i>the biggest party

a huge celebrity to host.</i><i>This year, it's Daphne Kluger.</i>- LOU: <i>Wow!</i>

But she's not our mark.</i>LOU: <i>So who's the mark?</i>All right,
who wants to go first?Yes.Do you know
who you're wearing?Uh, ooh...La Perla. It's black.(CHUCKLES)
No, I mean who's dressing you?DAPHNE: I don't really
know yet.The designer.I don't know yet.But as soon as I do,you'll be the very first
person that I tell.Uh, next question?LOU: <i>All right,
we need a designer.</i>DEBBIE: <i>Exactly!</i>LOU: Now a lot of these
we could target.But Anna won't approve them,and Anna
has to approve everything.DEBBIE: I know.LOU: There's a few
less-established choices,but they're not gonna
give us the juice we need.So...DEBBIE: Rose Weil.
Why do I know that name?Well, she was big,
in the '90s.Oh, God, all the Edwardian
collars and the ruffles.Travesty.
But Anna still likes her.They do Easter together
every year in Kent.- Brits?
- Irish.And she owes the IRS
$5 million.LOU: <i>It's bad.</i><i>There's a lien on her assets,</i><i>they've impounded
her passport.</i><i>The bank seized her townhouse.</i>DEBBIE: <i>She sounds amazing.</i>LOU: <i>Yeah.</i><i>I think we got lucky.</i><i>She gambled
everything on this.</i>DEBBIE: This is a flight to
nowhere without any peanuts.LOU: Self-financed.
Credit from an Omaha bank.Those guys over there?The only ones
who'll still loan her money.- (INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)
- They look a little worried.LOU: Yeah, who can blame them?
This is a train wreck.(GAGGING)(INDISTINCT CHATTER)Congratulations.Who are you?Big fans.- Very big.
- Oh.LOU: That was...
DEBBIE: Just...- Gorgeous.
- Mmm-hmm.No, it wasn't.It was a disaster.I think you're being
kind of hard on yourself.DEBBIE: Very.Did you read this?It's by a blogger.DEBBIE: Mmm.ROSE: "Rose Weil."Her new collection
is like taking a tour"of your grandmother's closet."Just as dated,
and just as musty."The Eskimo shove their
elders out on an ice floe."Just saying."That's very cruel.But it doesn't make it true.Mmm.How did I get here?You spent $18 million
in two yearsand had two houseboats
on the Seine.I'm old.Hey, you're not old.(SOBBING) I'm old,
and I'm going to prison.Then I'm going to be
really, really poor.Not necessarily.What if we could
make all this go away?Even get your passport back.How?Dress Daphne Kluger
for the Met Ball.LOU: Mmm.Are you mad?DEBBIE: Mmm-mmm.ROSE: No, hang on a minute.Are you journalists?- Absolutely not.
- God, no.Uh-uh.- Hmm. She seems sort of tense.
- Can be.Good body. Good boobs.
Huge features.Eyes like Bambi.Yeah. She can take
quite a lot.Maybe we could give her...
Maybe...Maybe we could give her this.God, no. Not chic.
We can do better than that.It's called the Toussaint.Named for Jeanne Toussaint,Cartier's director of jewelry
from '33 to '68.It's over six pounds
of diamonds.Right.After she died, they sold it
back to Cartier,and they've kept it
in their vault ever since.- They've never let it out.
- ROSE: Mmm-hmm.So then, how are we
gonna get it out?Well, they might
let it out for her.The theme of this year's ball- is European royalty...
- (GASPS)...of which the crown jewels
are a featured element.So, if you were to insist
on the Toussainton behalf of Daphne Kluger...(WHISPERS) Must be worth
quite a lot.DEBBIE: Yeah.- These are all Russians.
- They're hackers.Are there no hackers
who aren't Russian?No, there's barely any
Russians who aren't hackers.- Just keep looking, please.
- Sure.(AMITA SPEAKING HINDI)(AMITA'S MOTHER
SPEAKING HINDI)(IN ENGLISH) Okay.(INDISTINCT CHATTER)Sorry about Danny.Sorry about your pops.So, what are you doing here?I might have
something for you.A job.You wanna run some stuff
through the store?No, thank you.A little more than that.How long would it take youto make
seven pieces of jewelry,if the stones
were already cut?Probably five or six hours.How long if I told you
you didn't have tolive with your mother anymore?Less.I'm never taking
the F-train again.(LOU SHUSHING)She's in.DEBBIE: She is in where?This what you talking about?
Bunch of vases.LOU: Yeah,
that's the Egyptian wing.She's in the Met?Security cameras.There's a lot of 'em.My name's Debbie.- Nine Ball.
- What's your real name?Eight Ball.We use real names around here.Could I talk to you
for a minute?I asked you
to get me a hacker.She is one of the best hackers
on the East Coast.- Oh, I'm honored...
- She has other clients.They don't know
her real name either.I'm sorry, "other clients"?- Now?
- Yeah.Did you tell her
what her cut was?- Of course.
- And?(WHISPERING)
Look. She's smoking!So, Nine Ball.Uh, do I call you
Nine Ball? Nine...Or Baller.Baller? Okay. Okay.Uh-oh.You know your footprint
is a disaster, right?- I'm sorry, what?
- Your footprint.- My footprint?
- Yes, ma'am.If you're planning
to steal shit,you definitely
got to clean this up,'cause right now, my
little sister could hack you.Oh, right.
'Cause we had this guy...- (BEEPS)

- You'll see in a minute.Right, we're going to meet- Doris Kluger...

- Someone even more famous.LOU: Someone who makes
Daphne Kluger jealous.ROSE: Jealous?
LOU: Hmm.DEBBIE: In a minute,
we're gonna stand up.She's gonna sit down.You'll recognize her.
Just be cool.- LOU: Aloof.
- But kind.- But not too kind.
- Yeah.You're sweating.- Yeah, look, I sweat.
- Don't.On her left hand is a tattoo.I want you to take it,
admire it,but make physical contact,
and that's when we'll get it."It"? What's "it"?(NECK CRACKING)Hi. Wow.Oh, I know you!Yes, I know you. I've seen
you. I've seen you in things.(CHUCKLES) Yeah.- No, you're good.
- Oh, thank you.- You're really good. Yeah.
- Thank you.Well, I just really wanted
to say, "Thank you."Thank you?For helping us with
the feline rescue project.(CAMERA CLICKING)DAPHNE: Penelope Stern?Is she even old enough
to go to the Met Ball?- (SCOFFS)
- Apparently.Who cares
who's dressing her anyway?Uh, I think Page Six.I never met with Rose Weil.
You said I met with everybody.- You said she was a relic.
- I meant iconic.Do you want me
to set up a meeting?(MIMICS MOCKINGLY)- Yes!
- Okay.ROSE: <i>I watched
one of her films last night.</i><i>She's actually really good.</i>LOU: <i>Whatever you do,
don't fawn.</i>DEBBIE: <i>Just ignore her.</i>LOU: <i>Indifference,
it's an aphrodisiac.</i>DEBBIE: <i>Very little
eye contact.</i>- Rose.
- Oh.- Daphne. Miss Kluger.
- Finally. (CHUCKLES)So, thank you so much
for meeting me so last minute.I am such an admirer of yours.
I have so many of your pieces.- Really?
- Yeah.So, this search...
It has not been easy.And everything we've seen,- you know, it's been great.
- ROSE: Mmm-hmm.DAPHNE: But it's been tiredand you seem different.You know, like
you're immune to judgment.Like you're above all that.I'm sorry, what?What is going on?Uh...- Oh, sorry.
- (PLATE CLANGS)Um, what were you saying?I'm trying to hire you
for the Met Ball.Great. Thank you. My honor.Flattered.Wait till you see.This girl has some of the best
hands I've ever seen.Is this one sane?Hundred percent.All right, here's how
we're playing.Red is money, okay?Really? Three-card Monte?Follow the Queen,
live your dream.But don't sleep. Don't sleep.'Cause she might disappear,
you saw that?It's lit, right?She came back, though.
She likes you.All right, let's hit it.
And we're following the Queen.And we're following the Queen.Is this our only choice?The turnover
in pickpockets is huge.Where she at?
Where that bitch at?Where she at?That one.Wanna call a lifeline
on that one?- No. That one.
- (TAPPING)All right. That one is mine.Come on,
there's no hard feelings.And you're a real one, you
know? You know what I mean?Yeah, come back any time.- Not bad.
- Yeah. I thought so.- Turkey and provolone, please.

who do we have?</i>- What about Ivy?
- No, still in jail.- Really?
- What about him?- Well, he's a him.
- So?Don't want a him.Because it's a him
or because it's a "him"?No, he's not a "him."- I barely know the guy.
- What's wrong with a him?A him gets noticed,
a her gets ignored,and for once,
we wanna be ignored.What about Tammy?- (DOG BARKING)
- (BALL BOUNCING LOUDLY)Hey, buddy,can you do me a favor?
Can you take that outside?(LOUD BOUNCING CONTINUES)(CELL PHONE RINGING)(DOG CONTINUES BARKING)Debbie, I am with my family.- I told you...
- <i>I'm outside.</i>- What?
- <i>I'm in your garage.</i>(SIGHS)- (WHISPERS) Deb?
- DEBBIE: Hmm?Deb, what are you doing here?
I thought you were in jail.Mmm. I got out.Look at all this.
Thought you retired?I did.Not as exciting
as hijacking trucksthat are smuggling dishwashers
from Canada, right?Yeah, well,
I don't do that anymore.But you were
so very good at it.- Thank you.
- Yeah.So these are all
for personal use, right?- What do you want?
- Just wanna reconnect.- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.- Reconnect?
- Mmm-hmm.You're not bored out here,
are you, Tam-Tam?No, I'm not bored
out here at all.- Good, good.
- No.- Why would you ask that?
- Because I need a fence.Well, I told you I don't do
that anymore. I'm out.- It's a big job.
- I don't care.Do you want me to tell you
how big a job it is?No. No, I really don't.I think I'm gonna tell you
how big the job is.(INAUDIBLE)- Are you kidding?
- No.- Mommy, when's dinner ready?
- (GASPS) Shit!Uh, sweetheart,
I will be right there.I'm so sorry.
Mommy will be right there.- But I'm hungry!
- (INAUDIBLE)I know, sweetheart, I promise,
I will be right there.- (WHISPERING) Thanks a lot.
- She sounds sweet.(TAMMY SIGHS)How do you explain all this
to your husband?eBay.LOU: Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.We would like
to present to you allwith a hypothetical situation.- How hypothetical?
- Not very, unless we screw up.$16.5 million in each of
your bank accounts,- five weeks from now.
- (ALL GASP)(NINE BALL WHISTLES)In three and a half weeks,the Met will be
hosting its annual ball,celebrating
its new costume exhibit,and we are going to rob it.Not the ball itself,but a very important
set of diamondsthat will be
attending the ball.On the neck of Daphne Kluger.Who Rose will be dressing.- The Toussaint?
- DEBBIE: Very good.Once Daphne
is inadvertently onboard,we can then get the necklace
out of the Cartier vault,hack the Met security system,
thank you, Nine Ball,and infiltrate the Gala,considered to be
one of the most exclusive...The most exclusive.The most exclusive
party invitation in America.So go home,
get your affairs in order,because tomorrow,
we begin pulling offone of the biggest
jewelry heists in history.- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the big city.- How long?
- Uh, not too long, I promise.I'll be back
before you know it.What are you gonna do?I am going to help my friend
Debbie with her job.What kind of job?- It's complicated.
- Can I come with you?No, sweetie, this is Mommy's
very special work trip.DEBBIE: It is my account,
it is my money,and the only reason
I can't access itis because I cannot remember
the make and modelof my second cousin's
first car.So if you could just...
(INHALES DEEPLY)I don't wanna
make a withdrawal,I would like
to make a deposit.Yes, I...- Hey, can I...
- (SHUSHING)Exactly, yes. Yes, I'll hold.
What's up?Oh, hey, I was wondering
if I can get a MetroCard,'cause I'm skateboarding in
from Queens every day.Can I get a MetroCard?(STAMMERS)
I don't have a MetroCard.You don't have a MetroCard?I don't have a MetroCard.What are you, a tourist?(CHUCKLES)You're fascinating.You're gonna just
throw me one dubfor a MetroCard? That's it?How about this?
We steal $50 million,I'll buy everybody MetroCards.
How's that?Okay.- Is that your brother?
- Mmm-hmm.- He's hot.
- Mmm.CONSTANCE: You sure
he's dead or...DEBBIE: No.Yes, sweetie,
Mommy is in her new job now.Charlie,
will you do me a favor?Can you put that right there?What, sweetheart?Um, uh, well...Mommy finds very special toys,and then she finds
new homes for them.Yes, exactly like your turtle.
That is exactly right.(WHISPERING) Thank you so
much, Charlie, thank you.Sweetheart, I have to go.I just got a brand new
toy for Debbie,and I can't wait
to play with it.(WHIRRING)(POWERING DOWN)Zirconium.- I like it.
- Yeah, I bet you do.Unhand the man.Thank you very much.Here are your
very special glasses.If Rose can pull this off,
and that is a very big "if",these glasses
will scan the real necklaceand send a digital print
back to us here.Once we have that,this thing will printa replica
of the necklace in zirconium.(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)- (WHISPERING) Where is it?
- These are not the Toussaint.We thought you might
want to see these first.Right. What for?There are certain logistical
problems with that necklace.We wouldn't even know
how to insure it.(INHALES DEEPLY)All right.(WHISPERING) "We were
very clear on the phone."Yes. We were
very clear on the phone.We are only interested
in the Toussaint.Yeah.Well, then, that would have to
be a much longer discussion.That necklace is valued at
over $150 million.Well, I'm not really
a numbers person.It would require
its own security team,a new insurance policy.I'm sure you'll work out
all those details.(SCOFFS) Oh,
it's not that simple.I'm afraid the answer is no.No?No.Look, can I be frank?I have always loved Cartier.I think, historically,
this has beenthe most significant
house in the world.But there is whole generation
out therewho mispronounce your name.French can be difficult.(ROSE SPEAKING FRENCH)Oui.(DOOR CLOSES)(AMITA INHALES SHARPLY)Stop it. Stop,- that doesn't help. Stop.

Can't get a signal.Very secure down here, huh?Five feet of solid concrete.You said you wanted
to see it in the light.You wanted to see
the necklace in the light.Right!This is light.No, no, no, she means real
light. Natural light, yes.The red carpet happens
while the sun is still out.Yes, no,- I'm afraid that's vital.
- It's vital.Mmm. No, I must have the sun.She must have the sun.- How is this light, Ms. Weil?
- Um...Yes, I think,
yes, we have the sun.Much better.Mmm.- There it is!
- All right.Hello, sexy.TAMMY: Come on, come on.Ms. Weil. Is she okay?- She's fine.
- ROSE: Hmm.She needs to take it in.This is her process.TAMMY: It looks really good.- It's so clear.
- Yeah.Come on.No, okay. You gotta...No. Yep.- If you are done, Ms. Weil...
- (SHUSHES)- ...we'd like to...

- (ALL WHOOPING)I'm done.(MACHINE WHIRRING)Sweet.Mmm-hmm.(ROSE GASPS)Oh, my God!- Well?
- I don't know.Well, you don't know
because this is only a muslin.It's going to be pink,
for a start.I know it's going to be pink,
but I don't know.Yeah, I feel like
it's the waist.I feel, like, it's just...
And then the bottom.I don't know about the bottom.ROSE: We can definitely
change the hem.- It's the necklace.
- Oh, no.- It's not the necklace.
- It is the necklace.It's just messy.No, no, no, it's not messy.It's messy
'cause it's safety pins.No, you must remember
the diamonds.- (BREATHING HEAVILY)
- It's gonna be diamonds.(HYPERVENTILATING)
I just feel like I look huge.Hey, Daphne, come here.
Come here. Come here.Listen, deep breath...
Deep breath.(BREATHING DEEPLY)Listen, look.You've got one of the greatest
necks in the world.In fact, you've got
the only neckthat could carry
this necklace off.(STAMMERING) With your neck,
this necklace...You are gonna walk
into that Met Gala,and you are gonna
light up the sky.Thank you. (INHALES DEEPLY)- You're welcome.
- (EXHALES DEEPLY)If you like him,
you go right,and if you don't...- I go left.
- Yeah, you go left.- So...
- Okay, that sounds easy.- So do you like him?
- Ooh. I like him a lot.Okay, why?AMITA: He looks kind.I'm gonna swipe right.CONSTANCE: Okay. All right.
AMITA: Oh, my God!So does that mean...CONSTANCE: He liked you back!
He likes you, too!What happens now?
What happens now?- So you can message him.
- Okay.And you can say, maybe,
like, the eggplant emoji,or maybe the girl
that does this.(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)(COUGHING)(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)

to your right,or you can go back
where you came from,- right down there.
- Okay.It might take
a little bit longer.(PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)Excuse me, ma'am.Excuse me. Excuse me.REPORTER 1: (ON RADIO) <i>Here's
one for your morning commute.</i><i>Last night,

<i>Your news, all the time.</i>DAVID: <i>This is a major
security breach.</i>How is this even possible?He did it at the Tate, too.So you're sayingthe system your company
designed for our museumdoes nothing to prevent
someone like Banksy...Sir, we're a little
more focusedon keeping things in
than keeping things out.(INDISTINCT CHATTER)Hey! How about an "Excuse me"?DAVID: Correct me
if I'm wrong.You and your company
are responsiblefor monitoring
and safeguarding...Hey, want me to get the trash?What? No.You sure? 'Cause you got
a lot here, buddy.Fine. Just hurry it up.DAVID: The museum's agreementwith your father's company
is very...- Generous.
- Specific.Have a nice night.DAVID: The board expects
McCallister Securityto live up to the letter
of that agreement.KYLE: (ON EARPIECE) <i>We'll do
a full audit of the system</i><i>and update any part of it
that needs to be changed.</i>DAVID: <i>What does that mean?</i>KYLE: <i>We'll go in and fix it.</i>
DAVID: <i>When?</i>KYLE: <i>Immediately.</i>DEBBIE: <i>So, now that
we've gotten them</i>to make changes
to their system,we can make changes, too,
and not be detected.Can you pull up the cameras?They've got every inch
of this place covered.But here is not where
we're gonna hit it.We are gonna do it in a spot
they don't even care about.Nine Ball.Now it's a New York State lawthat no cameras can be mounted
in a public bathroom.Apparently,
it's a privacy violation.Unless you're into that.LOU: And once we get
the Toussaint,we are gonna have to
get it out of therewithout being detected,and they're gonna go overtheir security footage
with a fine-tooth comb,and anyone seen exiting
that bathroomis gonna be a suspect.So...So we get a mule.Somebody else
is gonna move it for us.How much space
do you need outsidethat bathroom
to plant it on somebody?I don't know. Nine feet?And how long
is it gonna take usto build
a nine-foot blind spot?- Moving a camera?
- Mmm-hmm.Bit by bit, 10, 12 days.DEBBIE: Great.How long did it take you
to figure all this out?Mmm...Five years, eight months,
and 12 days.Give or take.TAMMY: Cartier has hiredthe best private security
in the world.Guillermo DeVitaled the pope's security

they've never lost a pope.- DEBBIE: Mmm.
- Yuri Eshel, former Mossadand IDF Special Forces,

they're assassins.- Well, it's a nice necklace.
- Yeah.So you can go ahead and just
add them to your list.- What list?
- That list.It's not a list.Okay. Who is he?Hey, boo.Oh, Paul.(COMPUTER CHIMES)(KNUCKLES CRACKING)- (GASPS)

Thank you for having me.I guess you heard, we lost
one of our coordinators.Yes, and that sounded awful.Chiggers.I know.- What are those anyway?
- It's like a mite, I think.It burrows into the skin
and lays its eggs inside.And then they hatch
and they dig their way out.Apparently, it can last
for weeks.Well, you certainly
seem qualified.Thank you.Maybe overqualified.Well, how can anyone
be overqualified?This is the Met Gala
after all.Gala. Met Gala.- It's Gala.

fallen off in there.It could've fallen off

of law enforcement.I work with
the insurance carrier.Which means
I'm either looking for fraudor I'm looking
for the real necklace.Beyond that,
I couldn't care less.I'm afraid you won't find
either here.We'll see about that,
Monsieur...- Monsieur?
- Delarue-Broussard.Okay.Lawrence,
when did you last seewhat you believe
to be the authentic item?When it left here
for the Met Gala.When did you know
this was a fake?The moment it was returned.And you two.You had your eyes
on the necklacethe entire evening?Apart from when
Miss Kluger had herunfortunate incident
in the public toilet.That's correct.Did you accompany her inside?It's a women's bathroom.It's a very big necklace.There is only one entrance
in and out.We were stationed at the door.Did you check the plumbing?- No.
- I did.Okay, keep going forward.Squeaky clean, so to speak.(SIGHS)Whoever stole this necklacemanaged to get out
without being detected.Which means we're looking
for someone very smart.Gentlemen.I've seen
a thoroughbred racehorsethrown into a tree shredder.People will go
to great lengthsto defraud
an insurance carrier.There! What's this?I'm saying
that's not a blind spot.- What do you call that then?
- The bathroom.I don't see a bathroom.That's...Because it's
in the blind spot.(SIGHS) What can someone steal
from a bathroom anyway?I don't know, toiletries,mints, hand towels,a six-pound diamond necklace,
apparently.Now, who's this?A busboy?Do you know him?How would I know a busboy?Aren't we posh?I don't know everyone who goes
in and out of the museum.Why do you care
about a busboy?He's the only person who moves
in and out of the blind spotduring the period in question.Could you please
stop calling it a blind spot?Fine.The bathroom door
that we can't seebecause of your unique
camera placement.This is the most sophisticated
museum security in the world.Every piece of art is recorded
from multiple angles.We just don't happen to
keep art in the bathroom.I'm not a critic, Kyle.I'm an insurance investigator.I didn't wanna do it.But Eric's all, like,
"Come on!"I'm, like, "Dude, I don't
do that anymore."He's, like, "Everyone's out
on the loading dock!"I know it was really stupid.I know I'm an asshole,but it wasn't even my weed.I'm sorry, what?It wasn't my weed!
Do you want meto pee in a cup or something?No, that won't be necessary.Are you sure?
I really don't mind.I'm positive.They put the necklace on me.Then I walked the red carpet.Then I saw the exhibit.Then I ate my soup.Then I hurled my guts out.Then the necklace was gone.And then
everybody freaked out.And then they found it again,
I thought.But, no?This gentleman.- Claude Becker.
- Mmm-hmm.He was my date.Was there ever a time
you two were alonewhile you were wearing
the necklace?(MOANING)No.Anyone present with you
in the bathroom?My head was in a toilet bowl.How 'bout after?A lot of people.Do you know this woman?No.Debbie Ocean,
convicted felon.Her brother, Danny Ocean,more convicted felon.She was present on
the night of the incident.Did she steal the necklace?Apparently not, she's
the only one with an alibi.Smiling at the camera
the entire time.Ooh. So...So I have five innocent people
who seem to be suspects,and someone who should be
a suspect but isn't.I have camerascovering every inch
of the museum,except for the loo,where $150 million was stolen
from that neck, your neck.- Interesting case.
- Mmm.Some days, I love my job.I love my job, too.- (FUNK MUSIC PLAYING)
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)(TAMMY LAUGHS)(DOOR OPENS)You guys are fucked.Nice place.It must be a bitch to heat.Excuse me!
You are trespassing.No. We asked her to come.TAMMY: You asked her to come?Oh.We realized a few days ago
that Miss Kluger...Was not
a total fricking idiot.Might have gotten a sense
of what we were doing.(CLICKS)You've got one of the greatest
necks in the world.DAPHNE: <i>First of all,
if there's one thing I know,</i><i>it's bad acting.</i>In fact,
you've got the only neckthat could carry
this necklace off.DAPHNE: <i>I almost
never throw up.</i>Even when I'm really wasted.It was in the water.It must have fallen off
while you were running.DAPHNE:
<i>And last but not least,</i><i>I never forget a face.</i>JOHN: <i>Debbie Ocean.</i>Yeah. Yeah.So, seems to me,
eight shares of 150 millionis better than seven shares
of nothing, right?Chilly!Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!Let's not all high-five
at once.Plus, I am the one
who is saving your asses- from insurance fraud.
- What?- Insurance fraud?
- I was gonna get to that.When?It seems that they've assigned
an insurance investigator...Who's about to look up
your ass with a flashlight.- Who?
- This little <i>Columbo</i> dude,everything
but the trench coat.Totally on to you.His name is John Frazier.- You know him?
- Yes.He busted my father twice
and my brother once.He's family.ROSE: All right.
Lest we forget,this entire enterprise
was to keep me out of jail.Hey. No one's going to jail.- CONSTANCE: Are you sure?
- We expected this.We prepared for this.Yup, that's clear.We will not be
the prime suspect.AMITA: Okay, well then
who will be the prime suspect?There's a few.
We've got the security guys,we've got the busboys...The shady guy
who put you away.Wow! (CHUCKLES)(GASPS) The boyfriend.DEBBIE: <i>Yup. They were gonna
be looking for somebody.</i>Just had to make sure
it wasn't one of us.It's nice.Thanks.That is amazing!
The precision...Right?It's always
the attention to detailand the little grace notesthat really make
something sing.Why are you doing this?DAPHNE: Uh...I don't have that many close
female friendships.And book clubs are the worst.So I just thoughtthis could be
something fun to share.You're becoming a criminal
because you're lonely?Who isn't sometimes, right?Are you an only child?DEBBIE: <i>Midsummer Night's
Dream</i> in Miami?TAMMY: It's Shakespeare.She did summer stock
at Williamstown,plus a bunch of off-Broadway.What about this one?
She looks good.Let's see. Regional theater,<i>but she trained at Juilliard.</i>It's really
a magnificent piece.This was your mother's?Left to me after her passing.A Swedish prince
gave it to herin exchange
for her deflowering. (GIGGLES)Are they worth something?Yes, they're worth
quite a lot."Take these,"
my mother said. "Now, go."It was moonlight,and then he said,"I'd give you every star
in that sky."I'm sorry. (CRYING)It must be difficult for you.- Claude Becker?
- Yeah.- John Frazier.
- Hi.SPD Insurance. How are you?So, Claude...Like Jean-Claude Van Damme.Isn't it?What do you want?Here are some photographs
of youwith Miss Kluger.Now, as you can see,
there are many photographswhere your hand
is on the back of her neck.I don't really remember
where my hands were.Ah. To be you.Right?Problem is,the necklace has been stolenand a fake has been put
in its place.Right now, you're the personwith the greatest
opportunity...Why would I wanna steal
a necklace?That's what
I keep asking myself.Why would this guy,who's got everything,two of these...Why would that guy wanna
steal a necklace?What was your answer?Maybe he doesn't have
everything.I think we're done here.- Just a theory.
- Really.- A shot in the dark.
- We're done.I'm probably wrong.It's a beautiful piece,
and I want you to have it.I can't go any lower.
Just hold on one second.Hello?Oh, hey.Hi.What're you doing right now?(INDISTINCT CHATTER)DEBBIE: Hello, John.Hello, Debbie.You look well,
how long's it been?A few years.
Minus good behavior.- Right.
- Yeah.Thank you for calling.
I was gonna call you.- Yeah, I didn't do it.
- Of course not.You were just on camera
20 feet awaywhile the jewels
were being nicked.It's a coincidence.No. That's a solid alibi.What is it? Is it genetic?Are the whole family
like this?Except for my aunt Ida.- Librarian?
- Mmm. Homemaker.Right, I'm gonna
make this easy for you.I don't want you.I just want the necklace.I don't care.
I'll say I found it in a cab.How about some of it?- How much?
- Hypothetically, 10%.And where's
the hypothetical rest?Oh, I don't know. Literally.Oh, God. This is exhausting!I mean, when they said
come over, I was like... Ugh.You know, with the jet lag,
the time difference,Arsenal in the Cup Final
this weekend.But now I'm here.
It's bloody interesting.Yeah?So it's not just profit,
it's revenge.It's a twofer.He frames you, you frame him,
scores are settled.I'm just the courier.All is right with the world,
it's brilliant.Just trying to help out
an old friend.You know, one day, you are
gonna have to let this go?And one day, I will.Let's just say,
for argument's sake,that I do know where there's
a part of that necklace.Can you get a search warrant?(SIGHS) I'd need
probable cause.Well, we may or may not be
working on that right now.(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)Do you wanna play a game?What kind of game?A card game.- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh?- Uh-huh?
- Yes, yes!I'll be right back.- Where are you going?
- (CHUCKLES)CLAUDE: Wait.(CHUCKLES)CLAUDE: Where are you?I'll be right there.(CAMERA CLICKS)(CELL PHONE CHIMES)(GROANS)(DOORBELL BUZZING)(SIRENS WAILING)You have no idea how this
came to be in your possession?No.But you were Ms. Kluger's datethe night
these necklaces were switched.Yes, I was.Does that strike you
as a rather large coincidence?Including a 33.18, D color,
internally flawless diamond...DETECTIVE: <i>Are you familiar
with a company called</i><i>Becker Holdings, LLC?</i>CLAUDE: <i>Of course.</i>DETECTIVE: <i>Well, it seems
four sweet old ladies,</i><i>who apparently don't exist,</i><i>have recently transferred some
very large sums of money</i><i>into Becker Holdings, LLC.</i><i>Do you know how that might
have happened, Mr. Becker?</i>I think
I need to talk to my lawyer.(CHUCKLES) I think you do.- To our dear friend Carl...
- ALL: Claude.Claude Becker. May he rest
in peace in prison.ALL: Cheers.ROSE: Love you,
love you, love you.- LOU: Cheers.
- Cheers.I have a question.So...It's good
that he went to jail,'cause it's great
that we didn't.But if you only sold
the jewels for 85 million,how does it work out
that we get 16 apiece?Do you wanna?You thought we were just
gonna steal one necklace?What do you think we are,
a bunch of pussies?DEBBIE: <i>See, while everyone
was worried</i><i>about what was happening
around your neck...</i>LOU: <i>And you were
hurling your guts out...</i><i>Thanks for that, by the way.</i>It was amazing.- That was really impressive.
- (ALL AGREEING)That was really nice,
actually.DEBBIE: The place
kinda went on lockdown.LOU: <i>The kitchen
was cleared out, too.</i><i>And while everyone
was watching the entrance,</i><i>we thought we'd check out
the exhibit.</i>Because why would you
just steal one necklace,- when you could steal more?
- (ALL GASP)- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!That's a lot.Yeah.We didn't just print
the Toussaint from that thing.<i>We printed a lot of jewels.</i>AMITA: <i>Felt like I was
working at Kinko's.</i>LOU: <i>Meanwhile,</i><i>I decided to visit
an old friend.</i>(SPEAKS MANDARIN)<i>Amazon sells
these 20-foot selfie sticks.</i><i>All they saw
was a quick, little blur.</i>(LOU AND YEN SPEAKING
MANDARIN)DEBBIE: <i>It was a temporary
exhibit and they built</i><i>this metal grid
to hang the dresses from.</i><i>We just decided to suspend Yen
from that as well.</i>What if somebody came in?Oh. Somebody did.I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't
be here. We're clearing- this whole area.
- (SPEAKING GERMAN)- GUARD: Ma'am.
- (CONTINUES SPEAKING GERMAN)Calm down.(OVERLAPPING ARGUING)(IN ENGLISH) We're okay.DEBBIE: <i>Stealing the necklace
was great,</i>but without that diversion,without clearing out
the exhibit...LOU: We wouldn't have been
able to grab these.DEBBIE: These,which bring your cuts to
$38,300,000 each.- AMITA: Huh?
- Yeah.(LAUGHS)(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)Yeah.Yeah, I know.
It's so beautiful. (LAUGHS)Sweetie, I know,
but you can't put gumin your sister's hair.I don't care if she tried
to put it in your nose first.What's up, YouTube?
It's your girl!Check out my new crib.I'm on the co-op board.DAPHNE: Cut!
WOMAN: That's a cut!- Cut, cut, cut!
- WOMAN: That's a cut!Resetting back to one.DAPHNE: Uh, just, you know...
Smoother.Just a little bit of space,
please. It was perfect.I just need it faster
and more damaged.All right? Great.(WHISPERS) It's not that hard!(ENGINE REVVING)(BREATHES DEEPLY)You would've loved it.

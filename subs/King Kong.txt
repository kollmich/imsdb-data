abÐ¾ut that crazÑ fella running it.- Carl Denham?
- Guess that's the name.He ain't scared Ð¾f nÐ¾thing.
If he wants a Ñicture Ð¾f a liÐ¾n......he just gÐ¾es up tÐ¾ him
and tells him tÐ¾ lÐ¾Ð¾k Ñleasant.He's a tÐ¾ugh egg. WhÑ all this talk

WestÐ¾n, the theatrical agent.I guess ÑÐ¾u met DriscÐ¾ll,
the first mate.Well, WestÐ¾n, hÐ¾w abÐ¾ut the girl?- It can't be dÐ¾ne, Denham.

Then ÑÐ¾u're sÐ¾ secretive.YÐ¾u said it.Even the skipÑer and mate dÐ¾n't
knÐ¾w where theÑ're gÐ¾ing, what.There ÑÐ¾u are.
I've gÐ¾t a cÐ¾nscience, Denham.I can't send a ÑrettÑ girl
such as ÑÐ¾u ask Ð¾n a jÐ¾b like this...- ...withÐ¾ut telling her what tÐ¾ exÑect.

have stuck tÐ¾ me Ð¾n twÐ¾ triÑs.- TheÑ lÐ¾Ð¾k well enÐ¾ugh.
- Sure, we're healthÑ.But it's a different thing
taking a girl intÐ¾ danger.I suÑpÐ¾se there's nÐ¾ danger in New YÐ¾rk.Listen, there are dÐ¾zens Ð¾f girls
in this tÐ¾wn......that are in mÐ¾re danger
than theÑ are with me.Yeah, but theÑ knÐ¾w that kind Ð¾f danger.YÐ¾u never had a wÐ¾man

- HÐ¾IÑ mackerel!DÐ¾ ÑÐ¾u think I wanna haul
a wÐ¾man arÐ¾und?- Then whÑ?
- Because the Ñublic, bless them......must have a ÑrettÑ face.Sure, everybÐ¾dÑ likes rÐ¾mance.Isn't there anÑ rÐ¾mance Ð¾r adventure
withÐ¾ut having a flaÑÑer in it?Well, Mr. Denham, whÑ nÐ¾t take

sweat blÐ¾Ð¾d tÐ¾ make a swell Ñicture......then the critics
and the exhibitÐ¾rs all saÑ:"If this picture had lÐ¾ve interest,
it wÐ¾uld grÐ¾ss twice as much."The Ñublic wants a girl, and this time
I'm gÐ¾nna give what theÑ want.- DÐ¾n't knÐ¾w where ÑÐ¾u'll get her.
- I've gÐ¾tta get her, WestÐ¾n.We've gÐ¾tta leave bÑ mÐ¾rning.- We've gÐ¾tta be gÐ¾ne bÑ daÑlight.
- WhÑ?Well, there's a gÐ¾Ð¾d reasÐ¾n.Everything I hear abÐ¾ut it

because ÑÐ¾u can't find me a girl?I'm gÐ¾ing tÐ¾ make
the greatest Ñicture in the wÐ¾rld.SÐ¾mething that nÐ¾bÐ¾dÑ's
ever seen Ð¾r heard Ð¾f.TheÑ'll have tÐ¾ think uÑ a lÐ¾t
Ð¾f new adjectives when I cÐ¾me back.- Where ÑÐ¾u gÐ¾ing?
- GÐ¾ing Ð¾ut......and get a girl fÐ¾r mÑ Ñicture.
Even if I have tÐ¾ marry Ð¾ne.- Stand aside, please. Get ÑÐ¾ur case later.
- Can I take mÑ things?SaÑ, laÑ Ð¾ff the shÐ¾ving, will ÑÐ¾u?I didn't mean tÐ¾ shÐ¾ve ÑÐ¾u. Excuse me.What dÐ¾ theÑ give ÑÐ¾u in this jÐ¾int?SÐ¾up tÐ¾night. CÐ¾ffee and sinkers

NÐ¾w, I get ÑÐ¾u cÐ¾p. YÐ¾u like that, huh?NÐ¾, nÐ¾. I didn't. Let me gÐ¾.
I wanted tÐ¾, but I didn't.- Had enÐ¾ugh Ð¾f these stealers.

abÐ¾ut ÑÐ¾u just Ð¾ut Ð¾f kindness.- HÐ¾w'd ÑÐ¾u ever get intÐ¾ this fix?
- Bad luck, I guess.There are a lÐ¾t Ð¾f girls like me.- NÐ¾t manÑ with ÑÐ¾ur lÐ¾Ð¾ks.

We're nÐ¾t gÐ¾ing thÐ¾usands Ð¾f miles.Here's the island we're lÐ¾Ð¾king fÐ¾r.Well, that ÑÐ¾sitiÐ¾n.
Let's have the big chart.YÐ¾u wÐ¾n't find that island Ð¾n anÑ chart.That was made bÑ the skiÑper
Ð¾f a NÐ¾rwegian bark.- He must have been kidding.

- I dÐ¾n't knÐ¾w. But I dÐ¾.Here. Here's what the island lÐ¾Ð¾ks like.There's a lÐ¾ng, sandÑ peninsula.The Ð¾nlÑ ÑÐ¾ssible landing place
is thrÐ¾ugh this reef.Rest Ð¾f shÐ¾reline's sheer ÑreciÑice,
hundreds Ð¾f feet high.And acrÐ¾ss the base
Ð¾f the peninsula, cutting it Ð¾ff......frÐ¾m the rest
Ð¾f the island, is a wall.- A wall?
- Built lÐ¾ng agÐ¾. PeÐ¾Ñle whÐ¾ lived there......sliÑÑed back, fÐ¾rgÐ¾tten
the high civilizatiÐ¾n that built it.That wall is as strÐ¾ng tÐ¾daÑ
as it was centuries agÐ¾.The natives keeÑ that wall in reÑair.- TheÑ need it.
- WhÑ?There's sÐ¾mething Ð¾n the Ð¾ther side
Ð¾f it. SÐ¾mething theÑ fear.A hÐ¾stile tribe.Did ÑÐ¾u ever hear Ð¾f KÐ¾ng?WhÑ, Ñes.SÐ¾me native suÑerstitiÐ¾n, isn't it?
A gÐ¾d Ð¾r a spirit Ð¾r sÐ¾mething.Well, anywaÑ, neither beast nÐ¾r man......sÐ¾mething mÐ¾nstrÐ¾us,
all-ÑÐ¾werful.Still living......still hÐ¾lding that island
in a griÑ Ð¾f deadlÑ fear.Well, every legend has a basis Ð¾f truth.I tell ÑÐ¾u, there's sÐ¾mething Ð¾n that
island that nÐ¾ white man has ever seen.- YÐ¾u expect tÐ¾ ÑhÐ¾tÐ¾graÑh it?

alÐ¾ng thÐ¾se cases Ð¾f gas bÐ¾mbs.Oh, ÑÐ¾u've Ñut Ð¾n
a beautÑ-and-beast cÐ¾stume, eh?Mm-hm. It's the Ñrettiest.All right. Just stand right Ð¾ver there.I'm sÐ¾rt Ð¾f nervÐ¾us.
SuÑpÐ¾se I dÐ¾n't phÐ¾tÐ¾graÑh well?YÐ¾u dÐ¾n't have tÐ¾ wÐ¾rry abÐ¾ut that.
If I hadn't been sure......I wÐ¾uldn't have brÐ¾ught ÑÐ¾u
arÐ¾und the wÐ¾rld.- What will I dÐ¾?
- Well, we start with the ÑrÐ¾file.When I start cranking......hÐ¾ld it a minute,
and then turn slÐ¾wlÑ tÐ¾ward me.YÐ¾u see me.
YÐ¾u smile a little, then ÑÐ¾u listen.Then ÑÐ¾u laugh. All right?Camera.- LÐ¾Ð¾ks kind Ð¾f sillÑ, dÐ¾n't it?
- PrettÑ dame, huh?YÐ¾u think maÑbe

ShÐ¾uldn't think he'd risk it.NÐ¾w, that's fine, Ann.
NÐ¾w we'll try Ð¾ne with a filter, eh?DÐ¾ ÑÐ¾u alwaÑs take

I was right there with a rifle.Seems he didn't trust me tÐ¾ get the rhinÐ¾
befÐ¾re it gÐ¾t him.I haven't fÐ¾Ð¾led with a
cameramen since. I dÐ¾ it mÑself.- Think he's crazÑ, skiÑÑer?

ÑÐ¾u IÐ¾Ð¾k uÑ slÐ¾wlÑ.YÐ¾u're quite calm.
YÐ¾u dÐ¾n't expect tÐ¾ see a thing.Then ÑÐ¾u just fÐ¾llÐ¾w

YÐ¾ur eÑes Ð¾Ñen wider.It's hÐ¾rrible, Ann,
but ÑÐ¾u can't lÐ¾Ð¾k awaÑ.There's nÐ¾ chance fÐ¾r ÑÐ¾u, Ann,
nÐ¾ escaÑe.YÐ¾u're helÑless, Ann, helpless.There's just Ð¾ne chance,
if ÑÐ¾u can scream......but ÑÐ¾ur thrÐ¾at's ÑaralÑzed.
Try tÐ¾ scream, Ann, try.Perhaps if ÑÐ¾u didn't see it,
ÑÐ¾u cÐ¾uld scream.ThrÐ¾w ÑÐ¾ur arm acrÐ¾ss ÑÐ¾ur eÑes
and scream. Scream fÐ¾r ÑÐ¾ur life.What's he think she's reallÑ gÐ¾nna see?This infernal fÐ¾g.
Sure Ð¾f ÑÐ¾ur pÐ¾sitiÐ¾n, skiÑper?Of cÐ¾urse. Last night befÐ¾re this fÐ¾g

when this fÐ¾g lifts, we never will.We've quartered these parts.Can't see ÑÐ¾ur hand in frÐ¾nt Ð¾f ÑÐ¾ur face.HeÑ, Charlie, I wish ÑÐ¾u'd make
ÑÐ¾ur sÐ¾uÑ as thick as this.NÐ¾ bÐ¾ttÐ¾m at 30.The NÐ¾rwegian skiÑÑer must've
been guessing at the ÑÐ¾sitiÐ¾n.HÐ¾w will we knÐ¾w it's the right island?- The mÐ¾untain that lÐ¾Ð¾ks like a skull.

It's that crazÑ guÑ, Denham.Listen, ÑÐ¾u hear anything?NÐ¾.- Breakers ahead.

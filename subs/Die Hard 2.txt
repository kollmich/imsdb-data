Die Hard 2Hey! Whoa! Yo!
False alarm! Hold it!It's O.K.! I'm here.Here we are!
It's all right.Set it down
nice and easy, huh?Yeah, sure,
at the impound.Next time,
read the sign.Hey, you don't
understand.Look, I'm just here
to meet my wife's plane.You got to let me
have this car.Yeah, sure, tomorrow,
8:00 to 4:00.You pay 40 bucks,
we give it back.Don't write it up.
Don't write it up.Come on, man. This is
my mother-in-law's car.She's already mad at me
'cause I'm not a dentist.Look, I'm a cop--
L.A.P.D.Oh, I was in L.A. once.
Hated it.Well, I can understand.I don't like it
much myself--Hey!That's a plastic fender up there!
Take it easy!Cut me some slack,
will you?Look, I used to be
a cop in New York City.I only moved to L.A.
because my wife took a job there.Come on.
What do you say?Here we are--Washington, D.C.,
the heart of democracy.One hand
washes the other.Come on, man.

<i>at Escalan Airport</i><i>in the Republic</i>
<i>of Valverde</i><i>where government</i>
<i>authorities report</i><i>that deposed General</i>
<i>Ramon Esperanza</i><i>will be delivered</i>
<i>for immediate extradition</i><i>to the United States.</i><i>Only two years ago,</i>
<i>General Esperanza</i><i>led his country's army</i><i>in a campaign against</i>
<i>Communist insurgents,</i><i>a campaign fought with</i>
<i>American money and advisers.</i><i>Esperanza's fall from power</i>
<i>caused ripples</i><i>not only in his country's</i>
<i>recent election,</i><i>but closer to home,</i>
<i>as well,</i><i>when high-ranking</i>
<i>Pentagon officials were charged</i><i>with supplying him with weapons</i>
<i>despite the Congressional ban.</i><i>But mounting evidence</i>
<i>that Esperanza's forces</i><i>violated the neutrality</i>
<i>of neighboring countries</i><i>made Congress</i>
<i>withhold funds,</i><i>funds which Esperanza</i>
<i>is accused of replacing</i><i>by going into</i>
<i>the lucrative business</i><i>of cocaine smuggling.</i>[Beeping]<i>Although Esperanza was removed</i>
<i>as Commander In Chief</i><i>earlier this year,</i><i>the agreement to extradite him</i>

I'm somebody.Honey,
where are you?Did you land yet?It's the nineties,
remember?Microchips, microwaves,
faxes, airphones.Yeah, well, as far
as I'm concerned,progress peaked

we're going to beabout half an hour
late landing, O.K.?I just wanted
to let you know.The kids O.K.?Yeah, well, they're about
to lose their mindsfrom all the sugar
your parents are giving them.Did Mom give you
a hard timeabout borrowing
her new car?No. Not yet.Listen, honey,
when you land,can we just, like,
you know, rent a car,check into a hotel,leave the kids
with your parents,order some room service?A bottle of champagne,
what do you say?You're on, Lieutenant.I'll see you in about
a half an hour, honey.I love you. Bye.Isn't technology
wonderful?My husband
doesn't think so.Well, I do.I used to carry around
those awful mace things.Now...I zap any bastard
that screws with me.I tried it
on my little dog.Poor thing
limped for a week.Heh.Excuse me.Well, you look really
familiar to me.I get that a lot.

be the same.Been here
a lot of years,and I've been
right here with it.Yeah, I kind of

about that.<i>...cocaine smuggling,</i><i>racketeering, and bribing</i>

a wild-goose chase,but I think
I just saw--Saw what?Elvis. Elvis Presley.Fuckin' tourists.
Ought to be a law.Excuse me. There's
a large number of youfrom the justice department
here this evening.Is there any particular
reason for that?Just routine.Just routine?Yes.Any comment, sir?Not now.Thank you, sir.
Thanks.Hey, that's
Colonel Stuart over there.Got a little problem
with personnel.Last-minute replacement.How's the security
around this place?Like we figured--
a joke.Colonel Stuart, could we have
a few words, please?You can have two--
''fuck'' and ''you.''No pictures,
you pinko bitch.Old news.Oh!Damn it!Excuse me.Hey, man.What is it?You got a key
for this door?Yeah. Why?Because I want you to
open it up, that's why.Is there a cop on duty
around here?The airport police.Go get them.Ha ha ha!Hand me the wrench.Going to work
overtime.Good idea.O.K., hold that end.Watch it, man.All right.
Perfect. Perfect.Good to go.Hey!It's a restricted area.What's the matter?Couldn't wait
for the skycap?We work here.Let's see some I.D.Ha ha.Sure. No problem.Oh,jeez. Fuck!Hiyah!What is this--
a tag team?Aah!Aah!- Aah!

and flashed a badge?Yeah. He said to bring
you guys back here.Uh! Ah!Aah! Aah!Aah! Aah!Oh!Christ.[Glass Breaks][Bicycle Bell Rings]Fucker!Freeze!Nice guess, asshole.
I'm a cop.That was
the bad guy.Where's your I.D.?On its way
to Cleveland?No, you did not
explain anything.All you did was
shove me back hereinto this
cattle car.Sir, you were told
when you boardedthat we were
overbooked.Fine. Done.
I accept that.But why can't I get
the first-class meal?My network paid for it.
Do you know who I am?Yes. We've all
seen your program.Your episode
'' Flying Junkyards''was a very objective look
at air traffic safety.It wasn't nearly
as edifyingas '' Bimbos OfThe Sky,''
was it, Connie?You think
you're funny.You think you're funny.Fine.I've got
your number.And I've got yours.So park it, sir.Fine.Stewardess.Mr. Thornberg,you cannot
monopolize my time.You cannot put me
near that woman.Excuse me?He means he's filed
a restraining orderagainst me.I'm not allowed
within 50 feet of him.50 yards.So by keeping me
in this section,you are violating
a court order.I can sue you
and this airline.That woman assaulted me,and she humiliated me
in public.What did you do?Knocked out
two of his teeth.Would you like
some champagne?Sorry, Officer McClane.
I had to check.Here's your piece
and shield back.Thanks.Over here, Officer!We understand that
there was a shooting.The presence ofJustice
Department officials...Jesus!Hey, come on.
Just a word, O.K.?What the fuck
are you people--What are you
doing here, man?This is a crime scene.You got to seal
this area off.That's
up to the captain.Maybe you better take meup to the captain,
then, huh?Where's Cochrane?He didn't make it.You're late.We ran into trouble,
Colonel.Some cop...
killed Cochrane.I barely got away,
sir.Did you accomplish
your mission?Yes, sir, but...
Cochrane, sir.Well, then
the damage is minimal.The penalty
could be severe.You fail me again,and the chamber
won't be empty.Dismissed.Miss. Miss.
I can't find my dog.Miss. My dog.One minute, ma'am.I want you
to fill out this form.[Knock On Door]Who is it?
Come in.Captain Lorenzo?Yeah.I'm John McClane--Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.You're the asshole
that just broke seven FAAand five District
of Columbia regulationsrunning around
my airportwith a gun,
shooting at people.What do you call
that shit?Self-defense.Well, what, you think
that L.A. badgeis going to get youa free lunch or something
around here?Well...maybe a little
professional courtesy.Huh! In an airport
on Christmas week?You've got to be
kidding.O.K. Fuck courtesy.How about just
being professional?Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene, Captain.You can't wrap this thing
up in 1 0 minutes.You got to
seal the area off,take pictures,
dust for prints.Hey, don't
lecture me, hotshot.I know
what I'm doing.We're going
to dust it down.We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibers.When are you
going to do this?After 300 or 400
people go through?You'd be lucky
to get a printfrom one
of your own people.Just shut down
that area and--Oh,just
shut the area down.It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?Yeah, and I got everybodyfrom the Shriners'
Conventionto goddamn Boy Scouts
traipsing through here!I got lost kids,
lost dogs--Not now! Later!I got international
diplomats.I got a fuckin' reindeer
flying in herefrom the fuckin'
petting zoo!ButJohn McClane,
he's got a little problem.Hell, let's shut down
the whole fuckin' airport!What do you think
they're going to say upstairswhen I tell them that?Pick up the phone
and find out.I don't need
fuckin' Forensicsto tell me
all this waswas some punk
stealing luggage!Luggage? That punk
pulled a Glock 7 on me.You know what that is?It's a porcelain gun
made in Germany.It doesn't show up
on your airport X-ray machinesand costs more than
you make in a month.You'd be surprised
what I make in a month.If it's more than $1 .98,
I'd be very surprised.Hey, McClane,
don't start believingyour own press, huh?Yeah, yeah,
I know all about youand that Nakatomi thing
in L.A.,but just because the TV
thinks you're hot shit,that don't make it so.Look, you are
in my little pond now,and I am the big fish
that runs it.So you capped
some lowlife.Fine.I'll send your
fuckin' captain in L.A.a fuckin' commendation!In the meantime,
get the hell out of my officebefore I have you
thrown out of my goddamn airport!Hey, Carmine, let me
ask you something.What sets off the metal
detectors first--the lead in your ass or
the shit in your brains?Fat fuck.Any I.D. on this guy?That's somebody else's
problem.Your car's ready.
Sign right here.I need to borrow
this and this.I'll bring it
right back.Hey! Yo!
Hold up!Yo!Hold up, boys.
Hold up. Hold up.We got to check
something.What are you doing?Pretty gruesome
fuckin'job.All the confusion
in there,forgot to get
this clown's prints.Ew! Christ.Hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.Not anymore.Got a new S.O.P.
for DOAs from the FAA.Ha ha! I don't think
this one's going to make it, boys.Thanks a lot.[Speaking Spanish]Ahh.[Ring]Powell here.Take that Twinkie
out of your mouthand grab a pencil,
will ya?Ha ha! Hey,John,
how are you doing?Holly stood me up
a day,and I'm here alone
in D.C.with my in-laws.Eh, the old in-laws, huh?They do love their
policemen son-in-laws.Listen, Al,what is the fax machine
telephone numberthere at the station?Uh...5 5 5-3 21 2.3 21 2. Hold on a second,
all right?I want to send you
something.Excuse me.[Al] You and faxes?
This is a first.Yeah, well,
Holly told meI should wake up
and smell the nineties.This way?No. That way.Wait.
It's upside down.It doesn't matter.O.K. Here it comes.I'm sending you
something right now.Hold on a second,
cowboy.[Beep]Fingerprints?We've got an unidentified
stiff here.I've circled
the whirls in penin case the transmission's
a little fuzzy.Listen, run it
through state and federal,and if you can,
run it through Interpol.Will do.
Well, what's this about?Oh,just a feeling
I have.Ouch. When you get
those feelings,insurance companies
start to go bankrupt.Listen, the, uh,
fax number is...Is on the top edge
of the transmission...Is on the top edgeof the transmission
you just got.Oh, an airport, huh?Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?Ha ha. Yeah.And I'm fresh
out of chlorine.Just as this storm
starts breaking,the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.Look at this new front
moving in.Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.Well, I can sand down
all the runwaysand keep the plows going
between landings,but you got to
downshift them up there,give me time to work.You got it.All right, everyone.Let's call all our birds
and slow them downbefore we get a parking lot
over our heads.The line starts
at the Mississippi,and they better start
taking numbers.Can I get you another?No, thank you.I only have to
look at his facefor another 1 5
or 20 minutes.<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is the captain speaking.</i>I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Controlthat there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.We may be up here
a little while longer.Thank you.On second
thought...[Ring]Al?Hey, I'm right here,
partner.Your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.What can you
tell me about him?He's dead.You needed a computer
to figure that one out?No, no. You don't
follow me.According to
the Department of Defense,he's been dead
for two years.What?That's right. Sergeant
Oswald Cochrane.American adviser
in Honduras.Killed in a helicopter
accident 5-1 1 -88.Officer.Read between the lines,
and I'd say it lookslike a lot of black-bag
stuff to me.Yeah, I see it.All right, Al.
Thanks a lot.Hey, anytime.O.K.Say, I close
in about an hour.Maybe we can go
get a drink?Just the fax, ma'am.Just the fax.Hey, wait a second.
Wait. I see somebody.I'll call you back.The Ghost
of Christmas Past.Nakatomi? L.A.? You're
John McClane, right?Who are you?Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.Excuse me.Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.Word is that was
your handiwork.No. I only do
needlepoint.Great. National
just shut down.Totally iced.They're going to
be sending us their planes.Happy, happy holiday.The worst part,
Mr. Trudeau,was the press.Oh, they were
here anyways,crawling all over
the Esperanza story,so they got it right
on the fucking news.You know,
bloodstains and all.Personally, I'd like
to lock every damn reporterout of the airport,
but then they'd just pullthat freedom-of-speech
crap on us.Then the ACLU would be
all over us.Murder on television.Hell of a start
for Christmas weekend.What is it? A gang thing
like last time?Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.Who the hell
is this?Uh-uh,
McClane.I'm a police officer.In an unauthorized area.L.A., Mr. Trudeau,
don't mean shit.That's what I said
about my last
cholesterol test.So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to youthe minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.Maybe he can explain this.All systems
tapped, Colonel.Fire it up.'' H'' minus five minutes.Stand by.All right. We've got
a body in the morguethat seems
to have died twice.Assuming it's not
a computer error,what do we assume?That somebody's about
to seriously fuckwith this airport.What is that
supposed to mean?I mean, I know we're dummies
up here, McClane,so give us a taste
of your genius.This a hijacking?
A robbery? What?Look, I'm not sure.Oh, he's not sure.
Well, I'm stunned.I got to lie down.The only people that go
to this much troubleare professionals--
not luggage thieves and not punks.Professional at what?What the fuck do you
think this is, huh,the safety patrol here?This is the resume
of a professional mercenary.You got the world's
biggest drug dealer on his way here.You need a slide rule
to figure this out,or maybe another
body in a zipper bagbefore you start
asking questions?You're the one that gave us
that fucking body.Remember that.Yeah, I remember that.Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. Now.What? You're not
buying into this?I want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,no matter how trivial.
You got that?Yeah, I got it.Oh, my God!What?The runways.What the hell?They're shutting down.Jesus Christ.Go to emergency
lighting now.Emergency. We are
in a code yellow.Backup systems
won't come up.Shunt to another
terminal.Bobby, what
do you got?Nothing.

on the White House lawn.McClane, this
what you expected?No.This is just
the beginning.[Beeping]FAA hot line.How could they

<i>Foreign Military One.</i><i>Now, I'm sure you gentlemen</i>
<i>are well aware</i><i>of the unique nature...</i>Esperanza?<i>of this flight,</i><i>the importance</i>
<i>of its cargo.</i>This plane will not
be met by anyone.It will land on a runway
of my designation,where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.That will conclude my interest
in this aircraftand your responsibility
for it.At the same time, I want
a 7 47 cargo conversionfully fueled
and placed at my disposal.<i>You have two more minutes</i>
<i>to advise your inbound aircraft</i><i>to hold at their</i>
<i>outer radio marker.</i><i>After that,you will be</i>
<i>able to receive only.</i><i>Any attempt to restore</i>

you can't do this.I am doing this.O.K., you guys,
listen up.I need you to punch up
a code 1 5.I got an idea,
and I need your help.If Esperanza gets
on that planeand makes it to a country
with no extradition treaties,we're fucked.They're talking to us
on our own system.They got to be close.I'll have my men tear
this airport apart.Just in the nick
of time, huh?Hey, McClane, I got
a first-class unit here,S.W.A.T. team and all.We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.My wife's on one
of the goddamn planesthese guys
are fucking with.That puts me
on the playing field.If you'd have moved your fat ass
when I told you to,we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.That's it. Security.
You're out of here.Mr. Trudeau, do I
have to remind youabout FAA regulationsregarding
unauthorized personnelin the control tower?All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.Yeah, right. Somebody want
to run down to Radio Shackand get a transmitter?We already have one.The new terminal wing
they're building--20 airlines
when it's done,all with their own
reservation computers,all tied in to a nice
big antenna arrangement.You'd better see
Mr. McClane out.You got no business
being up here.I'm telling you guys.
Everything we needis over

waiting to go on line.The Annex Skywalk?Goddamn it, Trudeau.You're dealing
with pros here.You can't fuck

Come on, McClane.Just a few words.O.K.,just a few words.
Fuck off.Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.Stuart. The guy that got
canned by Congress.That's who he was.Huh? Who he who?
What? Hey!Shh! It's O.K.
I've done this before.Hi.Where's the other one?Claustrophobic,
I guess.It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so closeit doesn't matter.I can rig our frequency

know the difference.Get what you need.

his best men.Make you waste
your time...time we don't have.I think you're closer
than 50 yards.So's that airplane.
Practically.Yeah. There's quite
a few of them out there.It looks like
a regular traffic jam.There's nothing
regular about it.See? You're intrigued.That's my gift,
Mrs. McClane.I notice things--things other people
wouldn't see.That's how I make
people curious.Don't you mean
nauseous?Look. The people have
a right to knoweverything about everybody.You got
in the way of that.Listen, buster, you
endangered my children,and you didn't do itfor anything as noble
as the people.The only time you even
see the peopleis when you look downto see what it is
you're stepping on.Me? Yeah, I'll live,but Lorenzo's
S.W.A.T. team is dead,and the antenna array
is gone.[Beeping]Didn't you see it?It's hard looking
for a new miracle.Just hold
for a minute.I'll be
right back.Just hold
for a second.Something's
going on here.Yeah.Just hold on
for a minute.I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?It's got some kind
of scrambler on it.Can you do anything
with it?No.
This scramble modemust activate
on this code panel.Even if we scan
their frequency,we can't listen in.These guys are pros.So are you.
Break the code.I want to hearwhat these bastards are
saying to each other.This is a 1 0-digit
control panel.Six-digit read-out.Hell, there could be
a million combinations.Next time you kill one
of these guys,get him to enter
the code first.Yeah.Sir, we just
monitored a callfrom their
chief engineer.Our people took out
their S.W.A.T. team completely.You were right.
They went for the antenna array.We're right
on schedule.Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.Attention, Dulles Tower.<i>Attention,</i>
<i>Dulles Control Tower.</i><i>Mr. Trudeau,</i>
<i>I know you're listening.</i><i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>you're not obeying.</i>Try me face to face,
and we'll see.You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.<i>You've wasted lives</i>
<i>and precious time</i><i>on a futile</i>
<i>and obvious target.</i>Now you're going
to pay the penalty.I've got five dead officers
down here, Colonel Stuart.Isn't that penalty enough?McClane,
you keep out of this.You've been
nothing but a pain--<i>Oh, McClane.</i>
<i>John McClane.</i>The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.<i>I read about you</i>
<i>in</i> People <i>magazine.</i><i>You seemed out of your league</i>
<i>on</i> Nightline, <i>I thought.</i>Hey, Colonel,
blow me.How much drug moneyis Esperanza paying you
to turn traitor?Cardinal Richelieu
said it best.Treason is merely
a matter of dates.<i>This country's got to learn</i><i>that it can't keep</i>
<i>cutting the legs off</i>of men like
General Esperanza,men who have the guts
to stand upagainst
Communist aggression.And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?<i>What's lesson two--</i>
<i>the neutron bomb?</i>No. I think we can find
something in between.Watch this.Give me
a flight number,one that's
low on fuel.Windsor 1 1 4.

can be avoided.Out.[Woman Crying]We got no sign
of survivors down here.It's a goddamn nightmare.Hey, Nelson!
Come here.Barnes!We've got to
warn those planesthere's a lunatic
down here.Get up to the cabin.
Get me on the air.How?You figure it out!Here's the manifest.McClane, I know
how you must feel.I wanted to help
those people.I was pretty
goddamn useless.We called
the government for help.They're going to send in
a special Army unit,a counterterrorist team.Your wife's plane?Well, they're
still broadcastingeven though
we can't answer them.They're going to run out of fuel
in 90 minutes.Listen, Dick.That is your name?Dick.If you're going to continue
to get this close,do you think
you might considerswitching
after-shaves?Anything else?Stronger mouthwash
might be nice.<i>And here's Sam Coleman</i><i>reporting live</i>
<i>from the site of the accident.</i>Well, Colonel,they've done everything
we've anticipated...so far.<i>But still there has been</i>
<i>no official word.</i><i>Meanwhile, despite the fact</i><i>only one runway has been</i>
<i>closed due to the tragedy,</i><i>several dozen airliners are</i>
<i>visible from where I stand,</i><i>endlessly</i>
<i>circling the field.</i><i>Other reports say that</i>
<i>there was trouble in the tower</i><i>before the crash</i><i>and that that may have even</i>
<i>contributed to it.</i><i>One thing is certain.</i><i>With weather conditions</i>
<i>worsening,</i><i>the problem here</i>
<i>and in the sky above us</i><i>will continue to grow.</i><i>I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles</i>
<i>International Airport.</i>Victor. Victor.Victor.Yeah, what's up?Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot,or did you put them
in your carry-on?Are you crazy?I wouldn't let those assholes
check them in.I love you.Give me one
of the receivers.Can you tune in
to the cockpit frequency?Yeah. Why?I want to hear
what's going on.Should be right here
on our band.Nothing.You just told me
it would work.Is it working
or not working?It is working,
but it's--All I'm gettingis some kind
of airport beacon.It's weird.It's like the tower
isn't there.Stay on it.Let me know when there is
something there.O.K.Major Grant.
We're Blue Light.Rollins, Department
ofJustice.Trudeau, Chief

Terminal Police.You want something,
you got it.This is it?One fucking platoon?One Crisis-1 Platoon.
Who are you?John McClane.McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.Yeah.Now show some
good sense.Let the pros
handle this.Yeah, well,
it looks likethe pros are on
the wrong team tonight.Isn't Colonel Stuart
one of your men?No, not anymore,
he's not.Now we're hereto take Colonel
Stuart down.And we will
take him down.You see,
I served with him.I taught him
everything he knows.Well, maybe
he's learneda few more things
since then.Let's hustle!The command post
will be set upin the airport
police station.I want to be
tied in to the towerin 1 5 minutes.All right,
let's do it!Hey, Trudeau.Did things just get
better or worse?Lights--
big, portable lights.We set up the field,
and then we--We wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out.And where do we get
those big, portable lights--Borrow them
from Batman?What about
the airphone idea?There's 1 8 planes
up there.Only five of them
have those phones.We got through
to three of them.We're still trying
on the others.That leaves 1 3 accidents
waiting to happen.Are they still
bucking head winds?I just checked
the weather.Head winds are
slamming everybodyover the outer marker.The planes
with enough fuelhave already been
shunted to Atlanta,Memphis, and Nashville.Outer marker.Damn!The outer marker!It's a beacon, right?It sends out this
''beep beep beep''so they know they're
over it, right?So?So who says
that radio signalhas to just beep?Right.
We switch the frequencyfrom the tower
over to the one in the beacon.We pump up the wattage.And we can talk
to our planes,and those bastards
who did thiswill never know!Traced the signal.Found it in
the luggage area.They've been tapped into your tower chatter
all night.Punks stealing luggage,
huh, Carmine?How you doing,
Telford?No good.I called Lang.They're rigging
a portable decoder.It'll be here
in two hours.My wife doesn't
have two hours.I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.The regular guy
got appendicitis.Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.Attention!Except maybe
Colonel Stuart.I want to hear aboutthe plane
those bastards asked for.Then I'll fill you in
on my orders.Pilots' briefing room.
Now.Keep working.Albertson.

on the field or close,and I think
I know where.Come here. Let me
show you something.These are the old planswhen the longer
runways went in.That's 1 2 years ago.Looks like they've done
some modifications on site--moved Tra Con phones, I LS,all the underground stuffso they could
handle drainage.If I'm right,all of it would run
right along the airport propertyand go right past
this neighborhood.We should have been
on the ground two hours ago!I understand,
but if you just relax...It's hopeless.Somebody ought to get
their ass kicked for this mess,that's for sure.Well, unfortunately,there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.Oh, yeah? What about
that porker Willard Scott?I should have
taken the bus.At least they can pull over
for food and gas.Excuse me.Yes?I was just wondering.This flight originallywas supposed to be
5 1 /2 hours, right?Mm-hmm.Do we have
enough fuelto keep circling
like this?Oh, of course.They anticipate
little problems like this.Barnes, we looked
at 1 2 fucking houses,and we're nowhere.This is
our last possibility.Over here there's
an old church.Let's go.Wait.There's the church
over there.Could be a sentry.And he could just be
out for a walk.Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?Come on.All right.Just stay here and get ready
to call the marines.I thought
they were the army.Who gives a fuck?
Just be ready.[Beeping]Oh, shit.Not now.Aah!Lorenzo, it's Barnes.Barnes, where the hell
did you go?Where's McClane?He's with me.We're at the Hidey Lake

of the airport.You're where?
Goddamn it!You crazy idiot,
why didn't--This must be their
base of operations.Shut up and get
your ass over here!Move it!Code red! Sit rep.We got positive I.D.

Hello, gorgeous.Miss Fanny?Miss Fanny?
Down here, Emma. Third row.I came in early to tidy up,
and the doorman said you were in.What you doing out there?Mm.It's the one place in the theater
I've never sat.Maybe things look different
from here.This is the day, isn't it?Yeah.Any word yet?No. The wire just said tonight.You nervous?Ah. Nervous, happy,
scared, excitedâ¦I'm going to make a fresh pot
of coffee. You coming?No, no. I think I'll just sit here
for a while, okay?Well, I'll be in the dressing room
if you want me.Oh. Mr. Ziegfeld wants to see you.
When you feel like it, he says.He'll be waiting in his office.Thanks, Em.Did you hear that, Mrs. Strakosh?Ziegfeld is waiting for me.For me.See, you were wrong, Mrs. Strakosh.No, Fanny, darling, I'm not wrong.For a girl, for average,
you're a pleasure.But when people pay good money
in the theater, ha,especially the male element,
they want something extra to look at.But if a girl isn'tâ¦If a girl isn't what?<i>âª If a girl isn't pretty âª
âª Like a Miss Atlantic City âª</i><i>âª All she gets from life âª
âª Is pity and a pat âª</i><i>âª Kindly name a star who hasn't âª
âª Won a contest or a pageant âª</i><i>âª If she hasn't she just never âª
âª Gets to bat âª</i><i>âª She must a-shine in every detail âª
âª Like a ring you're buyin' retail âª</i><i>âª Be a standard size that âª
âª Fits a standard dress âª</i><i>âª When a girl's incidentals âª
âª Are no bigger than two lentils âª</i><i>âª Then to me âª
âª It doesn't spell success âª</i>Don't worry, they'll look at me.The whole world will look at me
and be stunned. Oh!That was all right when you were
a child and made funny faces.Then, you were cute.
My condolences, you're no longer cute.Aww.<i>âª From three faces that could cause ya âª
âª To have temporary nausea âª</i><i>âª Do I have to hear a lecture âª

What?You call that a replacement? What,
Eddie, did you owe somebody a favor?It seemed like a funny idea.
What's funny?That's what I say.
Back at 4.Yeah, but listen.
Wait, you're making a mistake.I've got a lot of experience, honest.
I've been on-stage since I was 10.Amateur contests,
Gottlieb's Southern Repertory,professional companies.
I doubled six parts.I played a daughter and her father.
A 60-year-old Indian chief.Listen, girlieâ¦
How. Ha-ha-ha.Please, you've got to face facts.
You don't look like the other girls.Butâ¦
You've got skinny legs, you stick out.And you are out! Eddie?
I'm trying to tell you somethingâ¦Sorry, kid.
Give me a chance!Out.
I do a terrific time step! Watch!Out.Look, Mr. Keeney, suppose
all you ever had was onion rolls.Now, all of a sudden,
in walks a bagel.So you take a look at it and say,
"What is that?"Until you tried it.
So that's my trouble.What's your trouble?I'm a bagel on a plate
full of onion rolls!Nobody recognizes me.

You got a sudden urge to go skating?I'm trying out a novelty number
tomorrow.If you can skate,
be here at noon.What about Keeney?
He won't be in till night.By then the number'll be in the show.

but I bet it isn't enough.When I get around to thinking
about you, I'll let you know.Well, if it isn't Miss Roller Skates.- Listen, I'm really sorry, girls.
- Oh, sure you are.We heard the applause.I'm sorry I loused up the number,
but I couldn't help it.Long as I did, I'm glad it was a hit.Who do you think will see you
in this dump? Florenz Ziegfeld?Why not? You think the word
can't spread? I'll spread it myself.I know a lady who knows the lady

He's gonna hear about me.Go ahead and laugh.

Yes.You.Gorgeous.I beg your pardon?
Oh, I mean, your shirt.It's absolutely the most gorgeous
thing I've ever seen in my life.What's it made out of?Oh, French handkerchief linen.
It goes very limp, though.Yeah. I can see.
Except, it's really beautiful.All the tailcoats I've seen,
I mean,well, they were rented, you know,they all got these stiff shirts.Well, this one's just for fun.You've probably heard this
very often that it's boring,but I had to tell you how much
I enjoyed what you did.It's not so boring. You'd be
surprised how boring it isn't.You're going to be a big star

Take it or leave it.I'll take it.
Leave it.I'm offering 35.You're offering?
Since when are youâ¦?In show business?
I'm not.One of your competitors
authorized me to deal for himwhenever I ran across a talent
I considered really unique.So, uh,$35 a week?Forty.
Forty-five.Fifty.
Heh.Well, I wasn't authorized
to go over 50.Keeney, she's yours for
$50 a week. Congratulations.Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah.Fifty dollars a week?Fifty a week?
I'm practically a millionaire!Hey, who's the competitor?
There's no competitor.What do you mean, you were bluffing?
Like in a poker game?Mm-hm.
Oh, uhâ¦Well, what if Keeney stopped first?
You'd have lost.I would've lost a job.
I was willing to take a chance.With my job?Hey, Nicky.Come on.
We're waiting. Hurry up.I'll be with you in a minute.Wow.
Are those yours?I'm just minding them for a friend.Look, we're going to Delmonico's
for supper. Won't you join us?We'd be happy to wait
while you change.I'd have to change too much.
Nobody could wait that long.I'd have a much better time
and a lot more laughs.Well, umâ¦thanks anyway but I gotta meet a gang
of people at my mother's saloon.Hmm?
Honest.You want a couple of jokes
to take with you?I'll wait till the next time we meet,

My stomach aches.I wonder how a mother

could call a boy Florenz.You think it's a job or an audition?
A job.You know what I think?
Somebody talked to him about me.See, I met this guy backstage
one night with a ruffled shirt on.Just the kind of guy you figure
to know Ziegfeld.I bet you he said a word.
That's what must have happened.Oh, my head aches.
Nothing aches.You're built like a horse.
I have nothing to wear.What's she been walking around in
all this time? Towels?It's coming too easy.
That's what's got me scared.Where's all the suffering
before you click?And the hard knocks, and the setbacks
you're supposed to learn from?This is too quick.
I haven't suffered enough yet.You haven't got the job yet. Who says if
you get it, in a week you can't lose it?Cheer up. Maybe you'll suffer later.If you're as bossy with Ziegfeld
as you are withâ¦I am not bossy with you or anyone.And even if I was,Ziegfeld isn't just anyone.And believe me,whatever he tells me to do,

I don't blame you for being mad.But I didn't do it out of spite.
I didn't plan it.I was just sitting here andâ¦
"Oh, look. What do you know?"Because I couldn't do it straight
like those girls.They would have laughed.And they did.
Yes, but it was my joke. You see?They laughed with me, not at me.
Because I wanted them to laugh.But, I meanâ¦
You know what I mean.No, explain it to me.Miss Brice can't see anyone.

You have a hit on your hands.Especially with my daughter, Fanny.
Ma.This is Mrs. Strakosh, our neighbor.
And this is Eddie Ryan. He's my friend.Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld. How do you do?
How do you do?Mr. Ziegfeld, you're a genius.To put a beautiful wedding gown
on a girl that's in the family way.Who would think of such a thing?Only one person I know.We'd better go. Mrs. Brice is
expecting half the neighborhood.Half? All.Free beer. You come, huh?
Mm-hm. Beer?Mama, I'll come home soon.Take your time. I'm gonna
be so busy showing off.How many mothers on Henry Street
are the mother of a Ziegfeld star?Bye.
I'll see you later.Well, you have a charming mother,
and I have a problem.I ought to fire you, but I love talent.And, well, it's hard to quarrel
with five curtain calls.Six.Well, there you are.
That's my problem.So I guess I'll have
to give you another chance.Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld! Uhâ¦Did he fire you?
Not yet.But I'll ring the curtain
down on youif you disobey my orders again.I won't. I won't. Never, ever.I'll do it straight tomorrow night. Umâ¦I mean, uh,without the, uh, pillow.You'll do it exactly as you did tonight.That's an order.
You mean you liked it?No! But the audience did. That's why
I'm going to give you another number.I'll choose a new song for you.Oh, thank you, Mr. Ziegfeld! The only
thing is, um, about that songâ¦I mean, a song, you know,
it's a very, very intimate thing.I mean, it's really between me
and the, um, audience. Ha, ha.So?So, um, ahem, one of the things I really
feel definite about is choosing my own.Choosing your own what?Songs. Songs.Oh.Good evening.And congratulations. Both of you.
Oh. Hello, Nick.It's you, my first ruffled shirt.
Good to see you. How are they running?Oh, ahead, Flo, just like you
and this little girl.First time I saw her, I had a
hunch you two belonged together.I have the same hunch.
And it's aging meâ¦fast.
Ha-ha-ha.I knew it. It was you
who told him about me.Afraid not, I wish I had.
I don't believe you.Have it your own way.And you had it your own way
on that stage tonight, didn't you?Six curtain calls.Only five.But you stopped the show.
I did! I stopped the Follies!I knew you would. I wrote the card
with your flowers before the show.What?
The yellow roses.Oh, I didn't even have
a chance to look! Oh.Oh, they're beautiful."Dear Star, I told you so."
Don't forget, I saw you work out.So where would you like to go?Luchow's? Delmonico's?
A party? Two parties?I can't. I gotta meet a gang of peopleâ¦
"At my mother's saloon."Not again. Can't you skip it?
No. It wouldn't be nice.It's sort of a party, um, for me.You wanna come?
I'd love to.You mean it?
Of course.Think it over.
It's a neighborhood thing.It might waste
the whole evening for you.I'll be with you, won't I?Oh.Go ahead, get dressed.Candidly, Mrs. Brice,
that's a good-looking fellow.Gorgeous. He reminds me of Fanny's
papa, my ex, also gorgeous.Wherever he is,
he should only stay there, huh?What do you do anyway?
I mean, between my opening nights?Live.
Everybody does that.Hardly anyone does. But I do.
And on the side, I gamble.You just gamble?Yes. Like you did tonight.<i>âª Ba-bum ba-dum âª</i>You married?No, Mrs. Strakosh,
I'm not married.So you're Mrs. Strakosh's
married daughter, Sadie.To a dentist.Oh, Mr. Arnstein, could I interest you
in a friendly little game of poker?Ha-ha-ha.
Three-cent limit.I was hoping you'd ask me.
Oh, good.Deuces, tens and jokers wild.
What?We're out for blood.Would you care to deal?
All right.Oh, look!
Heh.That's marvelous.I think he's played a game
of poker before, that Mr. Arnstein.The way he looks to home.He's a gentleman.A gentleman fits in any place.
A sponge fits in any place.To me, when a person's a stranger,
they should act a little strange.I bet.Call.
I call.I'm afraid you're too good for me.
Oh!I see. I got two pair.Oh, it's yours.Oh, I win, I win, I win!
Ha-ha-ha.How much do I owe?
Uhâ¦ I think 27 cents.Fine bunch of crooks
I introduced you to.We had a little more practice,
that's all.Oh, Fanny, darling,
I'm so happy for your success.Only one thing could make me happier.
What?To dance at your wedding.
Ha-ha-ha.Come on, children, sit down.Talk a little. Settle in.Oh. Should I murder her now
or wait till the party's over?Now.
No, I like her.Besides, I've been waiting all evening
for a chance to be alone with you.Where does that go?Uh, it's the alley.Come.Alone at last.Fanny, congratulations!Thanks, Mrs. Nadler.
I had to get up on account of the baby.He's a regular midnight fisherman.
He'll outgrow it. Ha-ha-ha.Alone at last.
Ha, ha.That's Henry Street.You're never alone. Everybody
worries about everybody.It's my home. I love
having people care about me.But I don't see how anyone
could help caring about you.Why, because I'm funny?Well, that's part of it.You know, it's a funny thing. I've imagined
you practically all over the world:Paris, London,
the Delaware Water Gap.Everyplace. Everyplace except
Henry Street. And here you are.You've imagined me?Well, I mean,
I thought about you a lot.Maybe it was your ruffled shirt.Anyway, you're like
a character in a book to me.And I hadn't read many books, see?
So that makes you kind of, umâ¦Oh. I talk a lot, don't I?
Yes.But it's one of the things
I like best about you.Boy, have you got good manners.It's your turn. Say something.
All right.With all these people who care about
you by the blockful and theater-full,doesn't it ever narrow down
to just one special person?You mean, like a boyfriend?I haven't had time.Ah, but don't get me wrong.
I mean, I know a million guys.After all, I am in the theater.
Oh, yes.Well, uh, see,
I've been very busy and, uhâ¦How about you?Hundreds of girls, huh?
Oh, thousands!All gorgeous.All gorgeous.Well, tonight should be
a nice change for you.It is.Thousands, wow.That way,
I don't get too involved.I like to feel free.You can get lonesome
being that free.You can get lonesome
being that busy.Now, who would think to look at
us that we got the same problem?<i>âª We travel single, oh âª</i><i>âª Maybe we're lucky âª

I wish I could get to know you better.So give me six good reasons
why not.Just one.I have to catch a train for Kentucky
early in the morning.What's in Kentucky?Oh, a half interest in a little farm.
I breed horses.What's the matter,
they can't do it alone?Hey, uh, you all packed? So,
what are you doing around here?It's late.
I'll walk you to the car.I should go in and say good night.
It's all right, I'll say it for you.You know,
if you weren't in a show,I think I'd have asked you
to come with me.Too bad, isn't it?I don't know. What with the
Follies and an indecent proposal,it's been quite a night.It was indecent, wasn't it?Very.
Oh, thank God.At least I can tell Mrs. Strakosh
things are looking up. Ha-ha-ha.May I call you when I come back?
Yeah, sure. When's that?I don't know exactly. I may go
right on to Europe or the coastâ¦You see, I never have definite plans.They make me feel too tied down.But I'll call you.Goodbye.<i>âª A feeling deep in your soul âª</i><i>âª Says you were half âª

You can't tell?All right, line up over here.Get over there.
Get over there, that's it.Conductor, baby. What time
is it, and where are we?It's 7 a.m., miss,
and we're in Baltimore.Baltimore?All right, just a second.
Hold it there.All right, girls, that's it.
Smile pretty.Hold it.Good. All right, girls.
Hold it, hold it.Now, where's that new star,
uh, um,Fanny Brice?Enter the star.Miss Brice?Hold it. Perfect. This'll just
take a minute, Miss Brice.How about a smile, Miss Brice?So shoot the picture.Now.Oh, very good.Great.
Yes, wasn't it? Terrific. I loved it.I'm coming.Fanny! Fanny.How wonderful to see you.And how wonderful you look.You look good too. The first time
I've seen you in broad daylight.Ha-ha-ha. You haven't changed.
And I'm glad.Do you know how long it's been?
Just a year.And two weeks.What are you doing here?I'm waiting for the train
from New York.My train?
That's right.Fanny, will you have dinner
with me tonight?Tell me all about Mrs. Strakosh
and about you.When a fella gets up at 7 in
the morning to meet a girl's trainâ¦I came here to meet
another girl, named Elsie.Good. I have plans,
so you can have dinner with her.Oh, it'll be very dull.Hm?There she is now.Thanks, Jack.
I'll see you at the stables.That's my girl Elsie.
Skinny legs, just like mine.How about dinner?
Will you, Fanny?You always ask me out,
don't you?Whenever you happen
to run into me.I've never known anyone so polite.
Fanny, Iâ¦But I still have other plans.
And I really must go.Thanks anyway.Oh, Fanny.
I can't give up this easily.I wanna see you too much.
We've such a lot to catch up on.Where are you staying?
Majestic?There's a nice little private
dining room downstairs.I'll reserve it for 8:00.
I hope you'll change your mind.I'll be waiting.No law against waiting.People do it all the time."No law against waiting,"
I said."People do it all the time."Should've heard me,
I was a regular Theda Bara.For once in my life, I didn't say
too much, I didn't say too little.I said just enough, then I walked.Oh. You like these flowers
in my hair?Why should I have dinner with him?
I'm not even hungry.You like these earrings?Even if I was hungry, I don't
need him to buy my dinner.Then why are you going?Huh?I said, whyâ¦?
Who said I was going?Won't you please come in?May I take your wrap?That color looks wonderful
with your eyes.Just my right eye.
I hate what it does to the left.You planning to make advances?I wasn't planning it,
but it does seem possible.Before dinner or after dinner?You look beautiful.You don't have to make leading-lady
dialogue for me. I'm a comic.On-stage.
That's where I live, on-stage.Then you're missing too much.You said we had
a lot to catch up on.I'm touring with the Follies. A
week here, then a week in Chicago.And then we rehearse a new show after that.
What about you?My girl Elsie's running in the
Baltimore Handicap next Friday.After that, I'm not sure becauseâ¦
You never have definite plans.I remember.Hey, somebody laid an egg
on your table.What is it?
A blue marble egg.I got it in Rome ages ago.It's one of my favorite things so I
thought you might like to have it.A blue marble egg
and yellow rosesâ¦You went to a lot of trouble even
though you weren't sure I'd show up.I hoped you would.Just as I hope
you like very dry sherry.I wouldn't know dry from wet.Mm.Fanny.What are you so angry about?Who's angry?Who's angry?I'm sorry if I'm disappointing you
in some way, but what did you expect?You didn't answer my question.
Why are you so angry?I am not angry! Why don't
you answer a question?Should I be flattered because your train
isn't leaving in the morning?Oh, this time you have
a few days to kill.You're not slumming at Keeney's.I never was and you know it.
Don't holler at me!I'm not hollering. You are.
Uh, that's different.I'm a natural hollerer. Anyway,
I answered your silly question.Look, why don't we cut through
all this and get to the point,which is: Why didn't I call you
when I got back from Kentucky?Oh.Well, you got busy. Umâ¦You, uh, forgot. Uhâ¦There could be a hundred reasons.Just one.I wanted to stay away from you.We were heading for something you
couldn't have known how to handle.What makes you think I do now?If you don't,it's time you learned.Umâ¦Maybe we should order now?Yeah.Are you sure you want to stay?Well, uh,might as well have dinner.
Ha, ha.Very sensible.Come in.Ah, Paul, I think
we're about ready now.Madame.Caviar, to begin with?No, I don't think so.Mm.Good.
Mm.Then we'll have filet de boeuf,
sauce bordelaise.Very good, Paul. Thank you.Very good. Thank you.All right?I would have ordered
roast beef and potatoes.I did.What's the matter?If I can't tell
what you're ordering,how will I know when
you're making advances?You'll know.
I'll be much more direct.<i>âª You are woman âª

What have you got?Ace of diamonds, Mm.Jack of spades, nine of hearts,
Mm.Four of clubs and
two of diamonds.Ahâ¦Take it.
I thought you were bluffing.Oh, ha-ha-ha!I got the pot.
What do you hear from Fanny?This morning she telephoned,
long-distance.Oh, yeah?
How did she sound?Hm. Two shows in a row
and three months on the road.How do you think
she sounded? Tired.She didn't sound tired.
Excuse me, I made a mistake.She sounded silly,
she kept laughing.Well, maybe something
strike her comical.A mother says, "How are you?"
That's so comical?She breaks out laughing.Another thing. On the road,
she lives like a mouse.All day in the hotel, all night
in the theater, no fresh air.But suddenly in Baltimore, MD,
she's runningup streets, down streets, museums,
racetracks, graveyards yet.Graveyard?Do you think it could be a fella?
Think? I know.Who?
Who is it?The ruffled shirt!
The ruffled shirt.Mm. Mm.Lady, if you're game for
this one, he's on the house.Nobody in history
ever had three.Ha-ha-ha.
Oh.Start boiling the water.I'm proud to think
that I'm the manwho introduced you
to your first lobster.Among other things. Ow.Behave yourself!
Ow!Oh.I get so mad when I think
of what I missed before I met you.I played Baltimore before, but never
realized it was the most beautiful city.Sort of makes me wish
you'd come with us tomorrow.See what you can do for Chicago.I was going to, I decided yesterday.Now I can't.What happened between
yesterday and now?You were there.
Elsie lost the Baltimore Handicap.And I lost Elsie and my shirt.But I was watching you.You didn't blink an eye.
You didn't lose your ruffled shirt.No, darling. I never lose that.Nor my gambling money.
Just about everything else.Soâ¦I have to take a train
for New York at midnightand the Berengaria for Europe
tomorrow night.Stop boiling the water.
I just lost my appetite.What's in Europe?
It's what's on the boat to Europe.A lot of bored men who have nothing
to do for eight days but play cards.Wait a minute.You are going to Europe
so you can play cards on the boat?Fanny, that's how I live.
I told you that on Henry Streetand the first night we were here.
Yes, I know.I know.I know it by heart.And, uh,you don't have to worry.
You're not involved.But I am involvedâ¦with a girl who has her own work,
is too busy to get lonesome.So we wave to each other
from boats and trains.I better get to the theater.Yes, sir.Fanny, please don't look sad.You walk back into my life, change
everything and walk out again.How should I look? Happy?But I'll be back in your life
again, darling. Very soon.Yeah, like last time.Not a bit like last time.
So, what's different?I love you.Do you mean that?You're not just trying
to be polite?You do mean it.What do you know?It's been the most beautiful week
in my whole life.Fanny, I should hurry
if I'm to drop you, get packedand catch that train
for New York.Well, pick me up
at the theater at 11and I'll go to the station
with you.Oh, why not?
Are you afraid I'll cry?No. I'm afraid I will.So where have you been
since 6:00 this morning?Walking.Just walking.If you're gonna die every time
you say goodbye to a manâ¦Calling Miss Brice, Miss Fanny Brice.Right here.Miss Brice?
Yeah?You feel better now?
Yeah. Yeah.Better.Thank you.Umâ¦Thank you.Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.Ten dollars?
Thank you!From Fanny Brice?
The last of the 5-cent tippers?Yeah, I should have made it 20.Emma. Emma.
Where's Emma?What is it, Fanny?I am not going to die. That's all.And I'm not going to Chicago either.Are you out of your mind?
What are you gonna tell Ziegfeld?I'd better find out. Please get him
on the phone for me. Emma.Where's Emma?
Have you seen Emma?Where is she? Em?Miss Fanny?
Be an angel and help me. Hold these.I'm only gonna take that bag and that one.
I'm not going to Chicago.What do you mean,
you're not going to Chicago?!Shh, shh, shh.
Where are you going?Empire Limited departing for New YorkFanny.At 8:30 a.m., now boarding at track 14.
Fanny.I told him.Please talk to her,
Miss Georgia.You can't. Once she makes up her
mind, she makes up her mind.Somebody has to talk to her.Who's she talking to?
Ziegfeld.You don't need me.
You have four other good namesand the tour is over in two weeks.You've said a lot of idiotic things.No, Flo.That's the most unprofessionalâ¦
Flo!- I've heard in my entire life!Hello?Will you simmer down before
your ulcer flares up?Funny coming from you.
You gave me that ulcer.Heh. Now, listen, Flo,
I love the theater.I love to hear an audience applaud,
but you can't take an audience home!I want a personal life too, and I'm gonna
have it. Why not just wish me luck?She can't walk out
in the middle of the show.She can't stop in the middleâ¦
What did he say?He hung up. Ha-ha-ha.
Let me have that phone.Ladies of the ensemble, adieu.Where are you going?
New York.Why?
I'm going to Europe with Nick.What?
You're kidding!I told you when I meet a guy
I want, I won't make jokes.Fanny, did Nick ask you
to go with him?No, but, uh,when he sees me, he'll be glad.I hope.Fanny!Uh, one ticket on the Empire Limited
departing for New York at 8:30 a.m.Haven't you any pride?I love the guy, he loves me.
I wanna be with him.You're making a fool of yourself.
Georgia, this is right for me.Is it right for Nick?
I'll make it right for him!Don't stick your neck out this way!
Don't do it! Don't do it!Don't. You mustn't do it. Don't quit.

very embarrassing.You crazy girl.What are you doing here?

to make your fortune,how would you know that I wasn't
after you for your money?Nick, I promise I'll never
tie you down. I promise.Will that be all, sir?Oh, yes, steward. Thank you.

of going without you.Me neither. Heh.Ahem. Nick, umâ¦
Yes?Go on, say it.
Oh.Well, ahem, you went to good schools.
I went to practically no schools.You're Park Avenue.I'm Lower East Side. Ha, ha.
Now, now. Don't be a snob.No, no. What I am

I'm all yours anyway, but, umâ¦Well, where I come from

sort of love each otherâ¦Mm-hm.
Uhâ¦Oh, never mind, never mind.Well, what do they do when
they sort of love each other?Ohâ¦One of them says,
"Why don't we get married?"Is that so?And sometimes it's even the man.
Really?Look, forget the whole thing.
Just forget I mentioned it.All right.Ah, thank you.You know,it's pretty much the same
where I come from.Well, why don't you stop making
jokes and say it so that I can sayI have to think it over, or ask
my mother, or turn you down.I've got a better idea.What's that?Have your drink.
Have my drink. Ugh.Look, why don't we,
uh, get married?When? Here? Tonight? When?The captain looks like a rabbi.How? When? Tonight? Right now?
When I make a bankroll.No, I don't care about that.
I do.I intend to be the head of this family.
You will. You're smarter.It'll be the way I say or not at all.Well, could you win what you need

Go ahead, go play cards.Wait.

âª It hurt my pride âª</i><i>âª The groom was prettier âª

I don't think they're ready for us.Oh, Nick.Oh, Nick!It must have cost a fortune.Well, I made a fortune
on the Epsom Derby.I expect to make another with this Florida
deal. There's nothing to worry about.Who's worried? Anyway, it's the
perfect house for a millionaire.<i>âª And for Sadie, Sadie âª</i><i>âª Married lady âª</i><i>âª Meet a mortgagee âª</i><i>âª The owner of an icebox âª</i><i>âª With a 10-year guarantee âª</i><i>âª Oh, sit me in the softest seat âª</i><i>âª Quick, a cushion for my feet âª</i><i>âª Do for me, buy for me âª

Open your eyes,
look at your daddy.Baby.I bought her something.An add-a-pearl necklace.
An add-a-tooth necklace would beâ¦Nick, you are absolutely crazy.She can't wear this
until she's grown up.But she'll know she has it.
It'll give her confidence.Besides, if you play
your cards right,she might loan it to you
until then.Mm. You bet she will.
Ha, ha. Won't you?Fifteen. One more.
Oh, please! Oh.Sixteen.
Oh!Look at me.
I'm breathing like a whale.The way that baby slowed me down,
I ought to sue her.She's so pretty, isn't she?Frances? She's the cutest
little thing I ever saw.Alive, alertâ¦
But she's pretty.Yes, Fan, she's pretty.
Very pretty. Come on.Ziegfeld made no mistake
hiring you.Heard from Nick lately?Yeah, he calls me every night.
From Oklahoma?Sure. With the phone bills
we're getting, he better strike oil.Come on, let's try this.Let's go.
Ooh.One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three, four.One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three, four.Nick!Oh.I can't believe it.There you are.
Thank you very much.Is that ghastly sound
coming from my daughter?What is it, honey? What is it, sweetheart?
Are you wet?Welcome home, Mr. Arnstein.
It's good to see you.What happened?
What happened to the baby?Look who's here, honey.
Frances, that isn't very attractive.So I wish you'd stop.Thank you, sweetheart.Why, you've stayed blond,
you clever girl.Miss Fanny, we're going
to be late for rehearsal.Oh, just a few more minutes.Would you take the baby
to Hilda for me?Sure.
Goodbye, my love.Say bye-bye.
Ha-ha-ha.You know what?This time I think maybe
you lost your ruffled shirt.We struck sand and rock
and water.I think we even
struck champagne.The one thing
we didn't strike was oil.Well, you'll think
of something betterwhile lying in a hammock
at your beautiful country house.It is beautiful, isn't it?Nick, it's been
absolutely murderdragging myself back and forth
to that theater every day.You guessed it.We better start looking
for an apartment in townon 5th Avenue.
Even on 6th. I wouldn't be insulted.You know what bothers me
even more than losing the house?It's the fact that I seem
to have lost my poker face.Just to me, honey. Come on.Place your come bets. Eight eats five.Coming out. Seven away, eight alive.New shooter.Nick.
Tom.Hey, the place looks wonderful.As you said, a church can look cute, but
a gambling house has to look honest.And be honest.
Ha, ha.Come on in here.Oh, Joe, a Scotch and water
for Mr. Arnstein.Well, when did you get back?Oh, a couple of weeks ago.It's good to see you, Tom.Well, what took you
so long to drop in?Well, we've been moving
into a new apartment in town.I've been helping
with the legwork.My wife has a show
opening tonight.Say, Nick, I was sorry to hear
about those oil wells.Is it all over town, Tom?Even made the papers.Oh, but that doesn't
mean anything.It's funny, though.I once dropped 20,000 on Monday,picked up 30 on Tuesday,
all in absolute privacy.The news travels
much faster these days.That spotlight on your wife
lights you up too.Any action in the backroom?
Now? Yeah, there's a game, butâ¦Nick.Just by way of limbering up.
Besides, I've got an hour to kill.I hear they haven't been
running too well.It'll change.He's not in his seat.I looked down during the number.
He's not in his seat.So maybe the guy's late, uh, ran into
an old friend or his watch stopped.You're getting excited over nothing.
Nothing? People get run over.They have accidents, don't they?Emma, go call the hospitals.
I mean, he could be lying in a street.Where's my eyeliner?
Do you see my eyeliner?Hurry up and get dressed,
will you?I'll call 300. Ahem.Five hundred. Bettor.No, not for me.Have a bite.
Keep your strength up.Food and liquor
right over there.Nick, it's after 9:00.Why don't you get out?No, Tom. Thank you.
I'll watch it.Telephone for you, Mr. Arnstein, in the
bar. It's your wife's maid at the theater.Well, look, tell herâ¦
Tell her I've been, uh, detained.I'll be there in time
for the second act. Thank you.What are you gonna do?
Shoot the swans?These lovelies?My swan girls?
What are you, dumb?<i>âª Can't you see âª
âª When you look at me âª</i><i>âª What a lovely creature is a swan âª
âª Yoo-hoo âª</i><i>âª I'm all over fluffy white âª
âª I wouldn't peck at you or bite âª</i><i>âª And have teeny twinkle toes âª
âª To dance upon âª</i>Oh, was that good!Prince!Was that necessary?You couldn't walk over here
like a person?Where was I? Oh, I was here.<i>âª So you just âª</i><i>âª Gotta have a swan âª
âª Or you're out of luck âª</i><i>âª 'Cause a chicken wouldn't do âª
âª It would only cluck âª</i><i>âª And besides you couldn't say âª</i><i>âª "I saw Chicken Lake ballet" âª</i><i>âª They would think you don't know nothin' âª
âª You are missing here a button âª</i><i>âª 'Cause a chicken's âª
âª Only good for consommÃ© âª</i><i>âª Whereupon, whereupon âª
âª Whereupon, whereupon âª</i><i>âª A chicken or a duck âª
âª Is a mistake âª</i><i>âª When you do Swan Lake âª
âª Swan Lake âª</i>I'm sorry, darling.How did it go?Good reviews?Wow."All any show needs
is Fanny Brice.""New York audiences continue
their love affair with Fanny."Darling, I'm so happy for you.How was the party?How was the party?There was no party.The guests didn't think the hostess
was in the mood for a party.Not without the host.Look, let's not fight
about this.Why not?Isn't your spoiling my opening
night worth fighting about?How do you think I felt out there,
trying to be funny?I'm trying to make them laugh.My own husband
not caring enough to be there!You didn't let your audience
suffer because of me.You're damn right I didn't.But how do you think I felt afterwards,
with people asking me where you were?What could I say? A poker game was
more important than my opening night?!To hell with your opening night!Why shouldn't the poker game
be as important as your opening night?It's my work, and I haven't
had a smash hit for a long time.But tonight I was winning. I wouldn't
have left that game for anythingbecause I thought maybe, finally,
at last my luck had changed.Only it hadn't.So it'll change tomorrow.The way it has
a hundred other times.Everyone has a run of bad luck now
and then. It doesn't mean anything.How would you know, darling?You never lose.Ohâ¦That was my crazy husband
on the phone.A guy with a deal for me offered
Nick a thousand to put in a word.He took the thousand and gave it to a
waiter he never saw before in his life.And he just put in a word.Ay-yip.You wanna play? Get a deck.Fanny, I never butted in
your life, did I?Sure. When I was a kid, you made
me wear long underwear to school.When your children grow up
and you wanna talk serious,I hope they make jokes.
I'm sorry.I just thought you were
gonna start in on Nick.Where would I come to criticize Nick?
It's you I'm surprised at.Why?Because when you look at him,
you only see what you want to see.I see him as he is.
I love him as he is.Fanny, love him a little less.Help him a little more.Mama, he doesn't need
any help. He's not a child.The man is drowning.
He owes money everywhere.He doesn't know
which way to turn.What?How do you know that?
Everybody knows. Only you don't know.Fanny, are you so wrapped up in the
show, you can't see anything else?Why wouldn't he tell me? He knows
he can have anything I've got.That's not what he needs.Darling, you are his wife.You've gotta sit down with him,
talk to him,think together what he should do.Some of that for me, Nick?Won't make a dent
in what I owe you, Peterson.But if you can't waitâ¦
Hey. I could wait. I could even forget it.In return for what?I need a front man,
someone like you,who can talk, for a bond deal
I'm putting together.It's a big one, Nick.You could make yourself a mint.
Thanks, but, uh, I don't think so.Heh. Okay. I guess when you have
Fanny Brice for a meal ticket,you don't get very hungry.
Nicky.Hey.I'm sorry, Peterson.Meal tickets,that's my joke.Sure.Boo!
Oh! Oh.Is Mr. Branca here yet?Not yet, Mr. Arnstein.
Well, I expect him any minute.This yelled through the window
of FAO Schwarz:"Take me home to Frances,"
it said. So I did.Will you give it to her for me? Thank you.
Yes, Mr. Arnstein.Oh, Hilda. Um,
Yes?You and the cook have been very patient,
but it's time I paid your salaries.I owe you for two months,
I believe.Miss Brice paid us, sir. All that was
owed and three months in advance.I mean, Mrs. Arnstein paid us.Miss Brice paid you.I'll get it, thank you.There you are.
Am I late?No, I just beat you in.
Oh.Let's go in here. I'll mix us a drink.
You tell me what you have in mind.All right.Hey, nice place, Nick.It's comfortable
and very convenient.Water or soda, Tom?
Straight. Look, I haven't got much time.The place is getting crowded
earlier these days.When you do that well,
it's called good trouble.That's what I want to talk to you about.
Nick.I didn't know you were home.
Hello, darling.Ah, Mr. Branca, I haven't
seen you for ages.I've been dying to see your show, Mrs.
Arnstein, but I've been so busy.I just dropped by to make
Nick a little proposition.Well, if it's some new way of
marking cards, Nick, don't listen.Aside from that, I'll leave you.
Although I'm dying of curiosity.Come back, silly. Get yourself
a drink and sit down.All right with you, Tom?
Of course. It's all in the family.Then sit down and start propositioning.
All right.Well, as I told you, the placeâ¦No, thanks.
The place is doing awfully well.So well that a couple money men
approached meabout opening another one on the
East Side. It's getting very fashionable.I'd like to, Nick.
I think it would go.But I can't possibly run
two places single-handed.Those people don't know
the first thing about this business.So I told them about you.And the long and the short of it is,
we want you to be a partner.With an extra cut for running
the place. How's it strike you?Pleasantly.
I'm flattered, naturally.And it's no secret
there's no place I'd rather bethan a gambling club.Except the theater
on opening night.It does sound like something
you'd be good at.I've always had a little yen
to run a club. And lots of ideas.Well, then, great. Then it's a deal.
Wait, wait a minute.It depends on how much I'd have to put
up for the partnership, becauseâ¦Nick, we don't need
your money. We need you.Well, how much are you
and the others putting in?Fifty thousand.And for me it's free?Tom, I can't let you
put up my share.I'm not. I swear I'm not.Look, our thinking is that
with your know-how and your,well, class is the only
word I can use,you'll attract all the right people.
We'll make our money back in no time.Full partnership for nothing?
Oh, except my class.Plus a cut
for running the place.That's a very generous offer.Too generous.Fannyâ¦how much were you
going to put in?Fifty thousand.Tom, I'm sorry
your time's been wasted.Nick, it is a good idea.
Was a good idea.Please don't blame Tom.
I talked him into it.Thanks for everything.Nick.I was just trying to help.
I don't want that kind of help!I don't want anyone
going around behind my back,sinking money into me
to make me look good.Fanny, Iâ¦I just wish you hadn't done it.You'd better go.
You'll be late for the theater.Iâ¦ I can't go. Not like this.Darling, listen. Please.Once I saw how unhappy you are,I knew I had to do something.
I guess I did it wrong.You know how dumb I can be.
Fanny.You don't have to tell me
that you did it out of love.Believe me, I know that.Murray Hill 4119.Peterson?Arnstein.Something wrong?It's Nick.He's hurt?No, no.
He's in trouble.He's gotten himself mixed
up in a phony bond deal.So, what do I do?I call a lawyer orâ¦?
No, he's got a lawyer.Branca got him Bill Fallon.And Fallon's the best criminal
attorney in New York City.Criminal?Fanny, embezzlement
is a criminal charge.Now, Fallon advised him to give himself
up, and he did. A few hours ago.He gave himself up?Ohâ¦You mean he's in jail?
Uh-huh.Nick.Iâ¦ I've gotta see him.You can't, honey.
They won't let you.- I just gotta.
- Lookâ¦Miss Fanny, is there
something I can do?Fanny. Fanny. Fanny, look.Heâ¦ He doesn't want
to see you.It's understandable, dear.
The man's humiliated, ashamed.Ashamed of what? This is Nick
Arnstein, not some hood!If these, uh, bonds were phony, you
don't think he knew it, do you?That's the line Fallon is going to use,
that he was a victim, a dupe.Fallon's going to call you at home.
I'd better go then.There are a bunch of reporters
at that stage door.Now, come on up to my office and go
out through the front of the house.Why? There's nothing to hide.You want me to go with you, Fan?No.Miss Brice.Will you answer a few questions?Sure, but I don't talk
very good yet.Hold that pose!Did you know Nick
would give himself up?He'll do anything not to
come home for dinner.Peterson says Nick masterminded
the whole swindle. What do you say?Nick. He couldn't mastermind
an electric light bulb out of a socket!Fanny, what about these stocks?Stock? The only stock I know
about is summer stock.What's your husband's story?
There's no story.My dope was an innocent dupe!
Or my dupe was an innocent dope?Did he try to sell you any bonds?That much of a dope, he ain't.You realize he might go to prison?
At least I'll know where he is nights.You still love him, Miss Brice?The name is Arnstein.Mrs. Arnstein.Mrs. Arnstein,
do you still love him?Next case."The People v. Arnstein.The grand jury has
charged the defendantwith embezzlement, according to Statute
119, Section A of the penal code."How does the defendant plead?Your Honor,
I move for a postponement.Why, Mr. Fallon?My client has been in custody only
24 hours. I've seen him only once.I've been unable to acquaint him
fully with the charges.He's unable to enter a plea without fullâ¦
Your Honor.Nick, please.
Sorry, Bill.Your Honor, there's no need for a
postponement. I understand the charge.I knew exactly what I was doing.
Nick.So I wish to plead guilty.I will see the deputy district attorney
and Mr. Fallon in my chambers.I'm sorry.You have only a few minutes.
Thank you.Nick. Oh, Nick.What happened in there?The minimum sentence, two years.With luck,
I'll be out in 18 months.With luck.Why, Nick?You had a chance.All you had to do was
say that Peterson tricked you.I couldn't say that.
Why not?Because he didn't.I want you to divorce me.What are you saying?We're just no good for each other,
that's all. Everybody knows that.Look, my darling,
I may not be good for you,but nobody has the right
to say what's good for me.Not even you.You think I don't know that everything
that went wrong was my fault?I know that.
It's no use, Fanny.Look, I've tried to tell myself
I'll catch up with you.It'll be all right.But there's no way
I can catch up with you.I don't want to run anymore,
not in a race I can't win.Let me go. Let me be myself again.
I can't.I can't just let you
go off to prison.Why not? Wouldn't
the publicity be good?I'll be with you in a minute.I'm sorry, darling.
That's what I've turned into.Nick.You think you mean this,
and maybe you do.But maybe it's just because
of all that's happened.So why don't we just
leave it for now?And if you still feel the same way
when you come home,I won't fight you.Okay?Okay.Listen, you
take care of yourself.Go out, see people,
do things, enjoy yourself.I don't worry about you.The moment you're out there on
that stage, nothing bothers you.Nothing.The strongest woman in the whole
world, that's what you are.Did you know that?Yeah, sure.Everybody knows that.So long, funny girl.Hey.
Ha, ha.<i>âª Funny âª</i><i>âª Did you hear that? âª</i><i>âª Funny âª</i><i>âª Yeah, the guy said âª
âª "Honey âª</i><i>âª You're a funny girl" âª</i><i>âª That's me âª
âª I just keep them âª</i><i>âª In stitches âª</i><i>âª Doubled in half âª</i><i>âª And though I may be âª</i><i>âª All wrong for the guy âª</i><i>âª I'm good for a laugh âª</i><i>âª I guess it's not funny âª</i><i>âª Life is far from sunny âª</i><i>âª When the laugh is over âª</i><i>âª And the joke's on you âª</i><i>âª A girl oughta have âª

in that theater all this time?Mm-hm.You all right?
Mm-hm.Then would you see
Mr. Ziegfeld? He's waiting.Yeah. Flo, come on in.I'll get your props for you.Any word from Nick?
No, not yet.I've been worried
about you, Fanny.I'm sorry you've
been worried. Flo.Huh?
Umâ¦I don't even know
if Nick wants us to go on,but if he doesâ¦I don't wanna make
the same mistakes.So if it means giving up the theater,
I hope you'll be a sport about it.Well, I won't be.
Ha, ha.But I won't worry about it
till it happens.Fifteen minutes, Miss Brice.
Thank you.I'll let you get dressed.Be happy, dear.Hello, Fanny.You must be that fella
I met at Keeney's one night.You must be that girl
from Henry Street.I feel like a kid
on a blind date.Did you see the baby, darling?No.I came straight here.Well, she's gorgeous.Getting to look just like you.Who says I'm not lucky?Fanny, Iâ¦I've had 18 months
to think about us.You wanna hear something funny?I've had the same 18 months,
and I never thought about us.Ohâ¦ I mean,
I simmered, I stewed,I cried my eyes out,but I never really thought.Not until today.Then I saw that you were right.You did a lot for me, Nick.That's what I'm gonna remember.What did I ever
do for you, darling?What did I ever give you that you
couldn't have gotten for yourself?Um, a blue marble egg.No one would have
given me that but you.And youâ¦ Youâ¦You made me feel sort ofbeautiful, you know,
for a very long time.You are beautiful.Five minutes.There are a lot of people
waiting for you.Goodbye, Fanny.Bye, Nick.<i>âª Oh, my man, I love him so âª</i><i>âª He'll never know âª</i><i>âª All my life is just despair âª</i><i>âª But I don't care âª</i><i>âª When he takes me in his arms âª</i><i>âª The world is bright âª</i><i>âª All right âª</i><i>âª What's the difference if I say âª</i><i>âª I'll go away âª</i><i>âª When I know I'll come back âª</i><i>âª On my knees someday âª</i><i>âª For whatever my man is âª</i><i>âª I am his âª</i><i>âª Forevermore âª</i><i>âª Oh, my man, I love him so âª</i><i>âª He'll never know âª</i><i>âª All my life is just despair âª</i><i>âª But I don't care âª</i><i>âª When he takes me in his arms âª</i><i>âª The world is bright âª</i><i>âª All right âª</i><i>âª What's the difference if I say âª</i><i>âª I'll go away âª</i><i>âª When I know I'll come back âª</i><i>âª On my knees someday âª</i><i>âª For whatever my man is âª</i><i>âª I am his âª</i><i>âª Forevermore âª</i>

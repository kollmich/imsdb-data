did the important stuff.We talked about this.You're not old enough to
decide about these things.We are old enough
to help out.Yeah!Isn't that what
you tell us, Dad?Yeah, well, "help out" can
mean many different things.But we're supposed to help,

something wrong?- Yes.
- <b><font color="#404040">BOB:</font></b> No.We didn't do
anything wrong.Superheroes are illegal.Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.The law should be fair. What
are we teaching our kids?To respect the law!Even when the law
is disrespectful?If laws are unjust, there
are laws to change them!Otherwise, it's chaos!Which is exactly
what we have!I just thought
it was kinda cool.- What was?

And this...Oh, hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late....is my tardy sister,
Evelyn.And I'm scolding myself so
you don't have to, Winston!Spectacular.My father was so proudthat I was even remotely
connected to you guys.He used to call you
the last line of defense.He was
your top supporter.He donated
to superhero causes.<i>He raised money</i><i>for the Dynaguy statue
in Avery Park.</i><i>He got to know
many Supers personally.</i><i>Even installed a phone</i><i>with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic...</i><i>in case of emergencies.</i><i>He loved that,
showed it off to everyone.</i>He was heartbrokenwhen you were all forced
to go underground.Father believed
the worldwould become more dangerous
without you.He didn't know
how right he was.<i>There was a break-in.</i><b><font color="#DF01D7">(BOTH GASPS)</font></b><b><font color="#404040">WINSTON:</font></b>
<i>My father called Gazerbeam.</i><i>The direct line.</i>- <b><font color="#DF01D7">(LINE BEEPS)</font></b>
- <i>No answer.</i><i>He called Fironic, no answer.</i><i>Superheroes had just been
made illegal...</i><i>The robbers discovered him
on the phone...</i>- <i>and shot him.</i>
- <b><font color="#DF01D7">(GUNSHOT)</font></b>So...<b><font color="#404040">ELASTIGIRL:</font></b>
It must've been hard.<b><font color="#404040">EVELYN:</font></b>
Especially for Mother.She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.If superheroes had not been
forced underground...it never would've happened.Or Dad could've taken
Mom to the safe roomas soon as he knew
there was trouble.I disagree strongly!But we're not going
into it right now.The point is...nobody expected usto be able to actually
run Dad's company.But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECHinto what it is today.<b><font color="#404040">FROZONE:</font></b> A world-class
telecommunications company.Bigger than ever.Perfectly positioned to make
some wrong things right.Hence, this meeting.Let me
ask you something.What is the main reasonyou were all
forced underground?- Ignorance.
- Perception.Take today for example,
with the Underminer.Difficult situation.You were faced with a
lot of hard decisions.Oh, tell me about it.<b><font color="#404040">WINSTON:</font></b> I can't.Because I didn't see it...neither did anyone else.So, when you fight bad
guys like today...people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.They see what politicians
tell them to see.They see destruction
and they see you.So, if we wanna changepeople's perceptions
about superheroes...we need youto share your perceptions
with the world.- How do we do that?
- <b><font color="#404040">EVELYN:</font></b> With cameras.<i>We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.</i><b><font color="#404040">ELASTIGIRL:</font></b>
<i>How do we do that?</i><b><font color="#404040">EVELYN:</font></b>
We embed tiny cameras, like those,into your Supersuits.Wow, so small.And the picture
is outstanding.Thanks!
Designed 'em myself.<b><font color="#404040">WINSTON:</font></b>
We've got resources, lobbyists,worldwide connections...and very important,
insurance.Insurance is key.All we need now are the
super-est superheroes.It needs you three.
Come on!Help me make all Supers
legal again.This sounds great!Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?That enthusiasm is golden.
<b><font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLING)</font></b>Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.- Better than me?
- <b><font color="#DF01D7">(CLEARS THROAT)</font></b>I mean, she's good.<b><font color="#DF01D7">(STAMMERING)</font></b>
Really, a credit to her...You know. <b><font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)</font></b>
You know.With great respect...let's not test the whole"insurance-will-pay-
for-everything" idea...- on the first go 'round, okay?
- <b><font color="#DF01D7">(FROZONE CHUCKLES)</font></b>Wait a minute. You're saying what?
I'm messy?Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...comparing all your last
five years of crime fightingbefore going underground.And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.Well, it's not
a fair comparison!Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.Of course!
We're gonna solveall kinds
of problems together.After the perfect launch
with Elastigirl!So, what do you say?What do I say?
<b><font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES)</font></b>I don't know.What do you mean,
you don't know?A few hours ago, you were
saying it was over...and being a superhero
was a fantasy.Now, you get the offer
of a lifetimeand you don't know?It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!So do I.From jail, Bob!- <b><font color="#DF01D7">(SPITS)</font></b>
- <b><font color="#404040">BOB:</font></b> And how do you do that?By turning down a chance
to change the lawthat forces them to hide
what they are?They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...whether they decide to
use those powers or not.This will benefit them.It's not a good time
to be away.Dash is having trouble
with homework...Vi is worried
about her first datewith that boy she likes,
Tony...and Jack-Jack...Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.I'm just not sure
I can leave.Of course you can leave.You've got to.
So that I...we can be Supers again,so our kids can have
that choice.<b><font color="#DF01D7">(SCOFFS)</font></b>
So you can have that choice.All right, yes!So I can have
that choice.And I would do a great job!Regardless of what Deavor's
pie charts say or whatever...But they want you.<b><font color="#DF01D7">(STRAINED)</font></b>
And you'll do a great...job...too.<b><font color="#DF01D7">(INHALES SHARPLY)</font></b>
Well, that was excruciating to watch.- <b><font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES)</font></b>
- I can't lie to you.It's nice to be wanted.
Flattering, you know, but...But what's the choice?One, do this right,get well paid,
we're out of the motel...and things get better
for all Supers,including our kids.Or two...I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.You know
it's crazy, right?To help my family,
I gotta leave it.To fix the law,
I gotta break it.You'll be great.I know I will.But what about you?
We have kids.I'll watch the kids,
no problem.- Easy.
- Easy, huh?You're adorable.Well, if there is
a problem,I'll drop this thing
and come right back.You won't need to.I got it,
you go do this thing.Do it so...I can do it better. <b><font color="#DF01D7">(GRUNTS)</font></b>- <b><font color="#DF01D7">(PHONE RINGS)</font></b>
- Deavor here.This is Elastigirl.I'm in.Mr. Deavor,
it's wonderful...<i>but it's too generous.</i>Nonsense! That's the
least we can do.We're partners now!Can't have my partners
living in a motel.<b><font color="#DF01D7">(STAMMERS)</font></b> But whose house?

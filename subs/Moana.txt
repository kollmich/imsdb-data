ever known.It could create life itself.And Te Fiti shared it with the world.But in time...some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.They believed if they could possess it...the great power of creation
would be theirs.And one day...the most daring of them all...voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.He was a demigod of the wind and sea.He was a warrior.A trickster.A shapeshifter who could change form...with the power of his magical fish hook.And his name...was Maui.But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...giving birth to a terrible darkness.Maui tried to escape...but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.Te KÄ!A demon of earth and fire.Maui was struck from the sky...never to be seen again.And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...were lost to the sea.Where, even now...1,000 years later...Te KÄ and the demons of the deep...still hunt for the heart.Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...chasing away our fish...draining the life
from island after island...until every one of us is devoured...by the bloodthirsty jaws...of inescapable death!But one day...the heart will be found...by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...find Maui...deliver him across the great ocean...to restore Te Fiti's heart...and save us all.Thank you, Mother. That's enough.Papa.No one goes outside the reef.We are safe here.
There is no darkness.There are no monsters.Monsters!- There's no monsters, no monsters...
- It's the darkness!No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.I'm gonna throw up.As long as we stay
on our very safe island......we'll be fine.The legends are true.Someone will have to go.Mother, Motunui is paradise.Who would want to go anywhere else?Shoo, shoo!Moana!There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.What? I wanna's go back.I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.It's dangerous.Moana, come on.Let's go back to the village.You are the next great chief
of our people.And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.MoanaMake way, make wayMoana, it's time you knewThe village of Motunui is all you needThe dancers are practicingThey dance to an ancient songWho needs a new song
This old one's all we needThis tradition is our missionAnd Moana, there's so much to doDon't trip on the taro rootThat's all you needWe share everything we makeWe joke and we weave our basketsThe fishermen come back from the seaI wanna seeDon't walk awayMoana, stay on the ground nowOur people will need a chief- And there you are
- There you areThere comes a dayWhen you're gonna look around
And realize happiness isWhere you areConsider the coconut- The what
- Consider its treeWe use each part of the coconut
It's all we needWe make our nets from the fibersThe water is sweet insideWe use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat insideConsider the coconutsThe trunks and the leavesThe island gives us what we needAnd no one leavesThat's right, we stayWe're safe and we're well-providedAnd when we look to the futureThere you areYou'll be okayIn time you'll learn just as I didYou must find happiness
right where you areI like to dance with the water
The undertow and the wavesThe water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehavesThe village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too farBut once you know what you like
Well, there you areYou are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and prideMind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice insideAnd if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest starMoana, that voice inside is who you areDad!I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.Come on.
There's something I need to show you.I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.This is a sacred place.A place of chiefs.There will come a time...when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.Like I did. Like my father did.And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.And on that day...when you add your stone...you will raise this whole island higher.You are the future of our people, Moana.And they are not out there.They are right here.It's time to be who they need you to be.- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside- The village believes in us
- That's rightThe village believesThe island gives us what we needAnd no one leavesSo here I'll stayMy home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrowThere we areI'll lead the wayI'll have my people to guide meWe'll build our future togetherWhere we are'Cause every path leads ya back toWhere you areYou can find happiness rightWhere you areWhere you areAnd every storm, this roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.Fixed!Not the fronds.Wind shifted the post.That's good pork!I didn't mean... I wasn't...What? They're calling me, so I gotta...
Bye!You're doing great.Is it done yet?So close.I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.Should we maybe just cook him?Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.Far beneath in some cases.But I'm sure there's more to Heihei
than meets the eye.It's the harvest.This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...Well...we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.There.Thanks, Moana.She's doing great.This suits you.Chief?There's something you need to see.Our traps in the east lagoon...they're pulling up less and less fish.Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.We have. There's no fish.Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.We tried.The windward side.And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.We've tried the whole lagoon.They're just gone.Have you tried using a different bait?I don't think it's the bait.There's no fish.It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...What if we fish beyond the reef?No one goes beyond the reef.I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...- Moana.
- And there's a whole ocean.We have one rule.An old rule, when there were fish.- A rule that keeps us safe...
- But Dad, I......instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.Every time I think you're past this...No one goes beyond the reef!Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.Standing on a boat.I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.But you still do.- He's hard on you because...
- Because he doesn't get me.Because he was you.Drawn to the ocean.Down by the shore.He took a canoe, Moana.He crossed the reef...and found an unforgiving sea.Waves like mountains.His best friend begged to be on that boat.Your dad couldn't save him.He's hoping he can save you.Sometimes...who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...it's just not meant to be.I've been staring at the edge of the waterLong as I can rememberNever really knowing whyI wish I could be the perfect daughterBut I come back to the waterNo matter how hard I tryEvery turn I take
Every trail I trackEvery path I make
Every road leads backTo the place I know
Where I cannot goWhere I long to beSee the line where the sky meets the seaIt calls meAnd no one knowsHow far it goesIf the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind meOne day I'll knowIf I go, there's just no telling
how far I'll goI know everybody on this islandSeems so happy on this islandEverything is by designI know everybody on this islandHas a role on this islandSo maybe I can roll with mineI can lead with pride, I can make us strongI'll be satisfied
If I play alongBut the voice inside
Sings a different songWhat is wrong with meSee the light as it shines on the seaIt's blindingBut no one knowsHow deep it goesAnd it seems like it's calling out to meSo come find meAnd let me knowWhat's beyond that line
Will I cross that lineThe line where the sky meets the seaIt calls meAnd no one knowsHow far it goesIf the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind meOne day I'll knowHow far I'll goWhoa.We're okay, Pua.I can do this.There's more fish beyond the reef.There's more beyond the reef.Not so bad.Pua!Whatever just happened...blame it on the pig.Gramma.Are you gonna tell Dad?I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.He was right.About going out there.It's time to put my stone on the mountain.Okay.
Well, then, head on back.Put that stone up there.Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?You said that's what you wanted.It is.When I die...I'm going to come back as one of these.Or I chose the wrong tattoo.Why are you acting weird?I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!Is there something you wanna tell me?Is there something you want to hear?You've been told
all our people's stories...but one.What is this place?Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?What's in there?The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.Who are you meant to be?Go inside...bang the drum...and find out.Whoa.Oh.Bang the drum.We read the wind and the skyWhen the sun is highWe sail the length of the seasOn the ocean breezeAt night we name every starWe know where we areWe know who we are
Who we areWe set a course to findA brand new island everywhere we roamWe keep our island in our mindAnd when it's time to find homeWe know the wayWe are explorers reading every signWe tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chainWe know the wayWe were voyagers.We were voyagers!We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!We were voyagers!Why'd we stop?Maui.When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.Te KÄ awoke.Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...and now we have forgotten who we are.And the darkness
has continued to spread...chasing away our fish...draining the life...from island after island.Our island.But, one day...someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...deliver him across the great ocean...to restore the heart of Te Fiti.I was there that day.The ocean chose you.I thought it was a dream.Nope!Our ancestors believed Maui lies there...at the bottom of his hook.Follow it, and you will find him.But why would it choose me?I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.But I know who does!- The crops are turning black.
- What about the fish?This is happening all over the island.- Please, please settle down.
- What are you going to do?We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!There's a cavern of boats.Huge canoes.We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!You told me to help our people.This is how we help our people.Dad?What are you doing?I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!No! Don't!We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!There is no heart!This is just a rock!No!Chief! It's your mother!Mother...What can be done?Go.Gramma.Go.Not now. I can't.You must!The ocean chose you.Follow the fish hook.Gramma...And when you find Maui...you grab him by the ear.
You say..."I am Moana of Motunui."You will board my boat..."sail across the sea..."and restore the heart of Te Fiti."I can't leave you.There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.Go!There's a line where the sky meets the seaAnd it calls meBut no one knowsHow far it goesAll that time wondering where I need to be
Is behind meI'm on my ownTo worlds unknownEvery turn I take
Every trail I trackIs a choice I makeNow I can't turn back
from the great unknownWhere I go alone
Where I long to beSee her light up the night in the seaShe calls meAnd yes, I knowThat I can goThere's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind meSoon I'll knowHow far I'll goI am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.I am Moana...of Motu......nui.Heihei?It's okay. You're all right.See?There we go. Nice water.The ocean is a friend of mine.Heihei?Heihei!Stay.Okay. Next stop, Maui.I am Moana of Motunui.You will board my boat...sail... across the sea...and restore the heart of Te Fiti.I am Moana of Motu...Board my boat!Oh, no.No, no, no!Ocean...can I get a little help?No, no.Please.Come on!Help me!Please!What?I said help me!And wrecking my boat?Not helping!Fish pee in you all day!So...Maui?Maui!Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...I am Moana of Motunui.You will board my boat.No. You will board my boat.Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.You will board my...Boat! A boat!The gods have given me a...Maui, shapeshifter...demigod of the wind and sea...- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.What?It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...hero of men.I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.I am...Sorry, sorry, sorry.And women. Men and women.Both. All.Not a guy, girl thing.You know, Maui is a hero to all.You're doing great.What? No! I'm here to...Of course.Yes, yes, yes.Maui always has time for his fans.When you use a bird to write with...it's called tweeting.I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.You are not my hero.And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!And you will board my boat...and sail across the sea and put it back!Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...which is impossible because...I got stuck here for 1,000 years...trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.So you could have the power
to create life itself.Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...is "thank you."- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.What? No, no, no!I didn't... I wasn't...Why would I ever say that?Okay, okay.I see what's happening

go through a whole ocean of bad.Not to mention Te KÄ.Lava monster?Ever defeat a lava monster?No. Have you?I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.You can't restore the heart without me...and me says no.I'm getting my hook.End of discussion.You'd be a hero.That's what you're all about, right?Little girl, I am a hero.Maybe you were.But now...now you're just the guy

restore the heart.Unless you don't wanna be...Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.Hero to...all.First, we get my hook.Then save the world.Deal?Deal.Worth a shot.Okay, we go east.To the lair of Tamatoa.If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.Teach me to sail.My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.I should...I should be sailing.It's called wayfinding, princess.And it's not just sails and knots...it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.Knowing where you are...by knowing where you've been.Okay, first, I'm not a princess.I am the daughter of the chief.- Same difference.
- No.If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...you're a princess.You are not a wayfinder.You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?You are a bad person.If you can talk, you can teach.Wayfinding.Lesson one. Hit it.Pull the sheet.Not the sheet.No.Nope.Nope. No.Tried that one already.You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.It's cold.Wait, it's getting warmer.That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?We're here?See, told you I could do it!Motunui?I'm home?- Moana!
- Dad?Moana!Mom?Help!No!Moana!Enjoy your beauty rest?You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps...so they actually get
where they need to go.Muscle up, buttercup.We're here.You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.And for Tamatoa, trust me...my hook is the coolest collectible.And he lives up there?No, no, no.That's just the entrance...to Lalotai.Lalotai?Realm of monsters?We're going to the realm of monsters?We? No. Me.You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.I know she's human, but that's not the...You know what? Forget it. Forget it!I'm not explaining it to you.'Cause then it's not funny.So, daughter of the chief...I thought you stayed in the village.You know, kissing babies and things.Hey, I'm just trying to understand...why your people decided to send...How do I phrase this? You.My people didn't send me.The ocean did.The ocean?Makes sense.You're what, eight? Can't sail.Obvious choice.It chose me for a reason.If the ocean's so smart...why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?Or bring me my hook?The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.You're the Chosen One!The ocean chose you for a reason.If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.So, not seeing an entrance.Yes, because it only appears...after a human sacrifice.Kidding.So serious.Don't worry...it's a lot farther down than it looks.Cheeeehoooo!I am still falling!You can do this.Go!And he sticks the landing.What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...Huh?Well, she's dead.Okay, let's get my hook.Maui's fishhook!Yeah!Sorry!I thought you were a monster...But I found your hook.And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.Stay.What? No.
I'm the one who found...Listen. For a thousand years...I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...getting my hook...and being awesome again.And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...Except...maybe as bait.Huh?Wow!The shiny, glittery cave.And just like me...it is covered in sparkly treasure.Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.You're not selling it!This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.When he shows up, keep him distracted.Make him talk about himself.He loves bragging about how great he is.You two must get along swell.No, not since I ripped off his leg.You ripped off his...Maui?What have we here?It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.It's a human!What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...Just pick an eye, babe.I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...Yeah, pick one, pick one!You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?Don't! That's my gramma's!"That's my gramma's!"I ate my gramma!And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.Why are you here?'Cause you're amazing!And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!And I just had to know...how you became so...crabulous?Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?Because if you are...I will gladly do so.Huh?In song form!Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glamI was a drab little crab onceNow I know I can be happy as a clamBecause I'm beautiful, babyAnd did your granny sayListen to your heartBe who you are on the insideI need three words
To tear her argument apartYour granny liedI'd rather be shinyLike a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreckScrub the deck
And make it look shinyI will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neckJust a sec

What's that for?That's man's discovery of Nunya.What's Nunya?Nunya business.I'll just keep asking.What's it for?You need to stop doing that.- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.I said back off.Is it why your hook's not working?You don't wanna talk, don't talk.You wanna throw me off the boat...throw me off.You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...I know I don't.I have no idea why the ocean chose me.You're right.But my island is dying...so I am here.It's just me and you.And I want to help...but I can't if you don't let me.I wasn't born a demigod.I had human parents.They took one look and decided...they did not want me.They threw me into the sea...like I was nothing.Somehow, I was found by the gods.They gave me the hook.They made me...Maui.And back to the humans I went.I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.Anything they could ever want.You took the heart for them.You did everything for them.So they'd love you.It was never enough.Maybe the gods found you for a reason.Maybe the ocean brought you to them...because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.You are.Okay, okay.I love you, too, buddy.Cheeeehoooo!Yeah!Next stop, Te Fiti.What?I figured it out.You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.All those new lands, new villages.It was the water that connected 'em all.And if I were the ocean...I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...to start that again.That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.I did.Moana of Motunui...I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.Moana! Moana! Moana!You're so amazing!It's time.Go save the world.Cheeeehoooo!Maui!What are you doing?Finding you a better way in!- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!- Turn around!
- No!Moana, stop!No!Are you okay?Maui?I told you to turn back.I thought we could make it.We?I thought I could make it.We can fix it.It was made by the gods.You can't fix it!Next time we'll be more careful.Te KÄ was stuck on the barrier islands.It's lava, it can't go in the water.We can find a way around.I'm not going back.We still have to restore the heart.My hook is cracked.One more hit, and it's over.Maui, you have to restore the heart.Without my hook, I am nothing.That's not true!Without my hook, I am nothing!We are only here...because you stole the heart
in the first place.No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...and you believed it.I am Moana of Motunui.- You will board my boat...
- Goodbye, Moana....sail across the sea...I'm not killing myself...so you can prove
you're something you're not!...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!The ocean chose me!It chose wrong.Maui!Why did you bring me here?I'm not the right person.You have to choose someone else.Choose someone else.Please.No.You're a long ways past the reef.Gramma?Guess I chose the right tattoo.Gramma!I tried, Gramma.I couldn't do it.It's not your fault.I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.If you are ready to go home...I will be with you.Why do you hesitate?I don't know.I know a girl from an islandShe stands apart from the crowdShe loves the sea and her peopleShe makes her whole family proudSometimes the world seems against youThe journey may leave a scarBut scars can heal and reveal justWhere you areThe people you love will change youThe things you have learned will guide youAnd nothing on earth can silenceThe quiet voice still inside youAnd when that voice starts to whisperMoana, you've come so farMoana, listenDo you know who you are?Who am I?I am a girl who loves my islandAnd the girl who loves the seaIt calls meI am the daughter of the village chiefWe are descended from voyagersWho found their way across the worldThey call meI've delivered us to where we areI have journeyed fartherI am everything I've learned and moreStill it calls meAnd the call isn't out there at allIt's inside meIt's like the tideAlways falling and risingI will carry you here in my heartYou remind meThat come what mayI know the wayI am MoanaI am Moana of Motunui.Aboard my boat...I will sail across the sea...and restore the heart of Te Fiti.Te KÄ can't follow us into the water.We make it past the barrier islands...we make it to Te Fiti.None of which you understand...because you are a chicken.No!Heihei! No, no, no!Nice work!Te Fiti.Maui!You came back.But your hook.One more hit and...Te KÄ's gotta catch me first.I got your back, Chosen One.Go save the world.Maui.Thank you.You're welcome.Cheeeehoooo!Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!Hey, Te KÄ!Shark head!Cheeeehoooo!Moana!Get the heart to the spiral!Te Fiti...it's gone.Te KÄ!Let her come to me.I have crossed the horizon to find youI know your nameThey have stolen the heart from inside youBut this does not define youThis is not who you areYou know who you areWho you truly are.Te Fiti!The chicken lives.I'm sorry about your hook.Well, hook, no hook...I'm Maui.Te Fiti!Hey, I mean, how you been?Look, what I did was...wrong.I have no excuse.I'm sorry.You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.Cheeeehoooo!Thank you.Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.Cheeeehoooo.Gonna miss you, drumstick.You could come with us, you know.My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.They already have one.See you out there, Maui.See you out there, Moana.Cheeeehoooo!Mom! Dad!Moana!I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.It suits you.She's back!Moana!Pua!Moana!Welcome home!We set a course to findA brand new island everywhere we roamWe keep our island in our mindAnd when it's time to find home
We know the wayWe are explorers reading every signWe tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chainWe know the wayShinyI'm so shinyDidn't help me though, did it?Still upside down here.Just need a little push.Can we be real?If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...you'd totally help me.You would. You know you would.<b><font color="#705050">.........subtitles by.........</font></b>

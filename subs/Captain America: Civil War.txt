the holiday menu at the commissary.They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.I'll get the bags.He does miss you when you're not here.And frankly, you're going to miss us.Because this is the last timewe're all going to be together.You know what's about to happen.Say something.If you don't, you'll regret it.I love you, Dad.And I know you did the best you could.That's how I wish it happened.Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...or BARF.God, I gotta work on that acronym.An extremely costly methodof hijacking the hippocampus...to (SIGHS) clear traumatic memories.(BLOWING)Huh.It doesn't change the factthat they never made it to the airport...or all the things I did to avoid

I was a 16-year-old kid again,in Brooklyn.And people died.It's on me.It's on both of us.This job...We try to save
as many people as we can.Sometimes that doesn't
mean everybody.But if we can't find a way
to live with that...then next time...maybe nobody gets saved.Vis! We talked about this.Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.Thank you. We'll be right down.I'll use the door.Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.STEVE: We know who it is?The Secretary of State.SECRETARY ROSS:
(SIGHS) <i>Five years ago...</i>I had a heart attack...and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.Turned out it was the best
round of my life...because after 13 hours of surgeryand a triple bypass...I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.Perspective.The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.You have fought for us...protected us, risked your lives...but while a great many people
see you as heroes...there are some...who would prefer the word "vigilantes."What word would you use,
Mr Secretary?How about "dangerous"?What would you call
a group of US-based,enhanced individuals...who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...and inflict their will
wherever they choose...and who, frankly, seem unconcernedabout what they leave behind?New York.(PEOPLE SCREAMING)Washington, D.C.(PEOPLE SCREAMING)Sokovia.Lagos.(SIREN WAILING)Okay. That's enough.For the past four years,you've operated with unlimited power...and no supervision.That's an arrangement
the governments of the worldcan no longer tolerate.But I think we have a solution.The Sokovia Accords.Approved by 117 countries...it states that the Avengersshall no longer be a private organization.Instead...they'll operate under the supervisionof a United Nations panel...only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.I feel we've done that.Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...you can bet there'd be consequences.Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.Believe me, this is the middle ground.So, there are contingencies.Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...to ratify the Accords.Talk it over.And if we come
to a decision you don't like?Then you retire.(VEHICLE CRASHING)MAN: Hello?Is this your car out front?I jumped the kerb.Maybe we could...take care of it ourselves.If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...- I guess.

a Congressional Medal of Honour...which is one more than you have.SAM: So let's say we agree to this thing.How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack uslike a bunch of common criminals?117 countries want to sign this.117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."How long are you going
to play both sides?I have an equation.Oh, this will clear it up.In the eight years since Mr Starkannounced himself as Iron Man...the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.During the same period...the number of potentially
world-ending eventshas risen at a commensurate rate.Are you saying it's our fault?I'm saying there may be a causality.Our very strength invites challenge.Challenge incites conflict.And conflict...breeds catastrophe.Oversight...Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.Boom.NATASHA: Tony.You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.It's because he's already
made up his mind.Boy, you know me so well.Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.It's discomfort.Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?(SIGHS)Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.He's a great kid.Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.Maybe be of service.Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas orFort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.He decided to spend his summerbuilding sustainable housing
for the poor.Guess where. Sokovia.He wanted to make
a difference, I suppose.We won't know because we droppeda building on him
while we were kicking ass.There's no decision-making
process here.We need to be put in check!Whatever form that takes, I'm game.If we can't accept limitations,if we're boundary-less...we're no better than the bad guys.Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.Who said we're giving up?We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.This document just shifts the blame.I'm sorry, Steve.That is dangerously arrogant.This is the United Nations
we're talking about.It's not the World Security Council,it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.No, but it's run by peoplewith agendas, and agendas change.That's good. That's why I'm here.When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.Tony, you chose to do that.If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?What if there is somewhere
we need to goand they don't let us?We may not be perfect,but the safest hands are still our own.If we don't do this now,it's gonna be done to us later.That's the fact. That won't be pretty.You're saying they'll come for me.We would protect you.NATASHA: Maybe Tony's right.If we have one hand on the wheel,we can still steer. If we take it off...Aren't you the same woman
who told the governmentto kiss her ass a few years ago?I'm just reading the terrain.We have made some
very public mistakes.We need to win their trust back.Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.No, you can't retract it.Thank you. Unprecedented.(MOBILE BUZZING)Okay. Case closed. I win.I have to go.(CHOIR SINGING HYMN)And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carterto come up and say a few words.(EXHALES SHAKILY)Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.She had a photograph in her office.Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.As a kid, that was pretty cool.But it was a lot to live up to.Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.I asked her once how she managedto master diplomacy and espionage...in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.She said, compromise where you can.But where you can't, don't.Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."When I came out of the ice,I thought everyone
I had known was gone.Then I found out she was alive.I was just lucky to have her.She had you back, too.Who else signed?Tony, Rhodey, Vision.Clint?Says he's retired.- Wanda?
- TBD.I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.There's plenty of room on the jet.(SIGHS)Just because it's the path
of least resistance...doesn't mean it's the wrong path.Staying together is more important

in the UN Vienna bombing...escaped custody today.Also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...and Sam Wilson.(GROANING)SAM: Hey, Cap!(BUCKY CONTINUES GROANING)Steve.Which BUCKY am I talking to?Your mom's name was Sarah.You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes. (CHUCKLES)Can't read that in a museum.Just like that,
we're supposed to be cool?What did I do?Enough.Oh, God, I knew this would happen.Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.- Who was he?
- I don't know.People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.I need you to do
better than "I don't know."He wanted to know about Siberia.Where I was kept.He wanted to know exactly where.Why would he need to know that?Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.(GROANING)(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)It hurts!(GROANING CONTINUES)(BOTH GRUNTING)(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)Good work.(PANTING)(SCREAMING)(COCKS GUN)Get me out of here.Who were they?BUCKY: Their most elite death squad.More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.And that was before the serum.They all turn out like you?Worse.The doctor, could he control them?Enough.Said he wanted to see an empire fall.BUCKY: With these guys, he could do it.They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize.They can take a whole country downin one night,
you'd never see them coming.This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.Even if he did...Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.We're on our own.Maybe not.I know a guy.I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?TONY: We will.GSG 9's got the borders covered.Recon's flying 24/7.They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.It's clear you can't be objective.I'm putting Special Ops on this.What happens
when the shooting starts?What, do you kill Steve Rogers?SECRETARY ROSS: If we're provoked.Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.There are dead people
who would be alive now.Feel free to check my math.All due respect,
you're not gonna solve thiswith boys and bullets, Ross.You gotta let us bring them in.How would that end
any differently than last time?Because this time,I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.72 hours, guaranteed.36 hours.Barnes.Rogers.Wilson.Thank you, sir.(EXHALES)My left arm is numb. Is that normal?You all right?Always.36 hours. Jeez.We're seriously understaffed.Oh, yeah.It'd be great if we had

- Right?Regarding the...You didn't even tell me about the grant.- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.- Right.
- Yeah.Remember when you applied?Yeah.I approved, so now we're in business.But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?You keeping secrets from me now?I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...Anyway, what did I apply for?That's what I'm here to hash out.Okay. Hash it out, okay.It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?This walnut date loaf is exceptional.- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?TONY: Yeah, it's pretty well funded.Yeah? Wow.Look who you're talking to.- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?Thrift store? Salvation Army?- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?Yeah, I was...Anyway, look, um,I definitely did not apply
for your grant...- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.Quick question of the rhetorical variety.That's you, right?Um, no.- (STAMMERS) What do you mean?
- Yeah.Look at you go.Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.That's not easy. You got mad skills.That's all on YouTube, though, right?That's where you found that?Because you know that's all fake.It's all done on the computer.Mmm-hmm.It's like that video. What is it?Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?Exactly.Oh, what have we here?- Uh...
- (CLATTERS)(EXHALES)You're the Spider-ling.Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?Spider-Man.Not in that onesie, you're not.It's not a onesie.I don't believe this.
I was actually havinga really good day today, Mr Stark.Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...and Algebra test, nailed it.Who else knows? Anybody?Nobody.Not even your unusually attractive aunt?No. No.No! If she knew, she would freak out.And when she freaks out, I freak out.You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.That tensile strength is off the charts.Who manufactured that?I did.Climbing walls, how you doing that?Adhesive gloves?It's a long story. I was...Lordy! Can you even see in these?Yes, I can.I'm blind!I can see in those.Okay?It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.You're in dire need of an upgrade.Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.That's why I'm here.Why you doing this?I gotta know, what's your MO?What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?Because...(STAMMERS)Because I've been me my whole life,and I've had these powers
for six months.Mmm-hmm.I read books, I build computers.Yeah, I would love to play football,but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.Sure, because you're different.Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...and then the bad things happen...they happen because of you.So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?Make the world
a better place, all that, right?Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.That's what it is.I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.(TONY EXHALES)You got a passport?No, I don't even have a driver's license.- You ever been to Germany?
- No.Oh, you'll love it.- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?I got homework.I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.Might be a little dangerous.Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.Don't tell Aunt May.All right, Spider-Man.Get me out of this.Sorry. I'll get the...(EXPLOSION)What is it?Stay here, please.(GASPS)Guess I shoulda knocked.Oh, my God!

the consequences of your actions.Okay, they're considered.(GROANS)Okay, we gotta go.It's this way.I've caused enough problems.(SIGHS)You gotta help me, Wanda.Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.Shit.(GROANS)I knew I should've stretched.(BOTH GRUNTING)VISION: Clint, you can't overpower me.I know I can't.But she can.Vision, that's enough. Let him go.I'm leaving.I can't let you.I'm sorry.If you do this...they will never stop being afraid of you.I can't control their fear, only my own.CLINT: Oh...Come on. We got one more stop.ATTACHE: It's just a matter of time.Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,and behavioural pattern scans.Move or you will be moved.As entertaining as that would be...You really think you can find him?My resources are considerable.Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...so you could probably do that
in about half the time.You know where they are.I know someone who does.Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.It's low profile.Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.Can you move your seat up?No.I owe you again.Keeping a list.You know, he kinda tried to kill me.Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.They're going to come looking for you.I know.Thank you, Sharon.That was...Late.Damn right.I should go.Okay.Cap.You know I wouldn't have called

he's behind all of this.<i>Captain.</i>Your Highness.IRON MAN: Anyway...Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.That was 24 hours ago.

innocent people yesterday.And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.BLACK WIDOW: Steve...you know what's about to happen.Do you really wanna

hand-to-hand.</i>Analyze his fight pattern.<i>Scanning.</i><i>Countermeasures ready.</i>Let's kick his ass.(CAPTAIN AMERICA GROANS)(PANTING)He's my friend.So was I.(COUGHING)<i>Stay down.

anything you think of.Shock absorption, lateral movement.Cup holder?You may wanna think about
some AC down in...- (TONY GASPS)
- Ow.Let's go. I'll give you a hand.No. Don't help me.(PANTING)Ah.(CHUCKLES)138.138 combat missions.That's how many I've flown, Tony.Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.Because the fight needed to be fought.It's the same with these Accords.I signed because it was
the right thing to do.And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...This is a bad beat.But it hasn't changed my mind.I don't think.(GRUNTS)- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)Are you Tony Stank?Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.Thank you for that!Never dropping that, by the way."Table for one, Mr Stank.- "Please, by the bathroom."
- (LAUGHING)STEVE: <i>Tony...</i><i>I'm glad you're back at the compound.</i><i>I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.</i><i>We all need family.</i><i>The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.</i><i>I've been on my own since I was 18.</i><i>I never really fit in anywhere,</i><i>even in the Army.</i><i>My faith's in people, I guess.</i><i>Individuals.</i><i>And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...</i><i>they haven't let me down.</i><i>Which is why I can't
let them down either.</i><i>Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.</i><i>I know I hurt you, Tony.</i><i>I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...</i><i>I was sparing you...</i><i>but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.</i><i>And I'm sorry.</i><i>Hopefully one day you can understand.</i><i>I wish we agreed on the Accords.</i><i>I really do.</i><i>I know you're doing what you believe in,</i><i>and that's all any of us can do.</i><i>That's all any of us should.</i>FRIDAY: <i>Priority call
from Secretary Ross.</i><i>There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.</i>Yeah, put him through.SECRETARY ROSS:
<i>Tony, we have a problem.</i>- Uh, please hold.
<i>- No, don't.</i>STEVE: <i>So no matter what...</i><i>I promise you...</i><i>if you need us...</i><i>if you need me...</i><i>I'll be there.</i>(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)You sure about this?I can't trust my own mind.So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...I think going back under
is the best thing.For everybody.(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)(AIR HISSING)Thank you for this.Your friend and my father...they were both victims.If I can help one of them find peace...You know, if they find out he's here...they'll come for him.Let them try.(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)<i>Hey, shady baby

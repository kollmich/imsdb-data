How strange the taste</i><i>Never forget the years,
the waste</i><i>Nor forgive them
for what they've done</i><i>They are the guilty Everyone</i><i>The day begins
And now let's see</i><i>What this new world
Will do for me</i>Can I help?
A day's work?Papers.No work here.Valjean, as a dangerous
man, you will be on parole forever.Failure to report
means immediate arrest.Be in Pontarlier in 30 days.Follow him.Let me see your papers.<i>Monsieur?</i>
Papers.I'll sleep in the stable.
Please, I'm hungry.Get out.Hey!<i>Come in, sir, for you are weary</i><i>And the night is cold out here</i><i>Though our lives
are very humble</i><i>What we have We have to share</i><i>There is wine
here to revive you</i><i>There is bread
to make you strong</i><i>There's a bed to
rest till morning</i><i>Rest from pain
And rest from wrong</i>Bless the food we eat today.Bless our dear sister
and our honored guest.Get in there!
Put him down!Stay there!Monsignor.We have your silver.We caught this man
red-handed.He had the nerve to
say you gave him this.<i>That is right</i><i>But, my friend,
you left so early</i><i>Surely something
slipped your mind</i><i>You forgot I gave these also</i><i>Would you leave
the best behind?</i><i>Messieurs, release him</i><i>This man has spoken true</i><i>I commend you for your duty</i><i>Now God's blessing go with you</i><i>But remember this, my brother</i><i>See in this some higher plan</i><i>You must use
this precious silver</i><i>To become an honest man</i><i>By the witness of the martyrs</i><i>By the passion and the blood</i><i>God has raised
you out of darkness</i><i>I have saved your soul for</i><i>God</i><i>What have I done?
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?</i><i>Become a thief in the night
Become a dog on the run</i><i>Have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late</i><i>That nothing remains
but the cry of my hate?</i><i>The cries in the dark
that nobody hears</i><i>Here where I stand at
the turning of the years</i><i>If there's another way to go</i><i>I missed it 20 long years ago</i><i>My life was a war
that could never be won</i><i>They gave me a number
and they murdered Valjean</i><i>When they chained me
and left me for dead</i><i>Just for stealing
a mouthful of bread</i><i>Yet why did I allow this man</i><i>To touch my soul
and teach me love?</i><i>He treated me like any other</i><i>He gave me his trust
He called me brother</i><i>My life he claims for God above</i><i>Can such things be?</i><i>For I had come
to hate the world</i><i>This world that
always hated me!</i><i>Take an eye for an eye!</i><i>Turn your heart into stone!</i><i>This is all I have lived for!</i><i>This is all I have known!</i><i>One word from him
and I'd be back</i><i>Beneath the lash, upon the rack</i><i>Instead he offers me
my freedom!</i><i>I feel my shame inside me
like a knife</i><i>He told me that I have a soul</i><i>How does he know?</i><i>What spirit comes
to move my life?</i><i>Is there another way to go?</i><i>I am reaching but I fall</i><i>And the night is closing in</i><i>As I stare into the void</i><i>To the whirlpool of my sin</i><i>I'll escape now from that world</i><i>From the world of Jean Valjean</i><i>Jean Valjean is nothing now!</i><i>Another story must begin!</i><i>At the end
of the day you're another day older</i><i>And that's all you can say
for the life of the poor</i><i>It's a struggle! It's a war!</i><i>And there's nothing
that anyone's giving</i><i>One more day standing about
What is it for?</i><i>One day less to be living</i><i>At the end of the day
you're another day colder</i><i>And the shirt on your back
doesn't keep out the chill</i><i>And the righteous hurry past They
don't hear the little ones crying</i><i>And the plague is coming
on fast Ready to kill</i><i>One day nearer to dying!</i><i>At the end of the day
there's another day dawning</i><i>And the sun in the morning
is waiting to rise</i><i>Like the waves
crash on the sand</i><i>Like a storm
that'll break any second</i><i>There's a hunger in the land There's
a reckoning still to be reckoned</i><i>And there's gonna be hell to
pay At the end of the day!</i><i>At the end of the day
you get nothing for nothing</i><i>Sitting flat on your bum
doesn't buy any bread</i><i>There are children back at home</i><i>And the children
have got to be fed</i><i>And you're lucky to be in a job</i><i>And in a bed</i><i>And we're counting
our blessings</i><i>Have you seen how the
foreman is fuming today</i><i>With his terrible breath
and his wandering hands?</i><i>It's because tittie Fantine
won't give him his way</i><i>Take a look at his trousers
You'll see where he stands!</i><i>And the boss, he never knows that
the foreman is always on heat</i><i>If Fantine doesn't look out,
watch how she goes</i><i>She'll be out on the street</i><i>At the end of
the day it's another day over</i><i>With enough in your pocket
to last for a week</i><i>Pay the landlord, pay the shop Keep
on working as long as you're able</i><i>Keep on working till you drop Or it's
back to the crumbs off the table</i><i>Well, you've got to pay your
way At the end of the day!</i><i>And what have we here,
little innocent sister?</i><i>Come on, Fantine,
let's have all the news</i><i>"Dear Fantine,
you must send us more money"</i><i>"Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose"</i><i>Give that letter to me
It is none of your business</i><i>With a husband at home
and a bit on the side</i><i>Is there anyone here
who can swear before God</i><i>She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?</i>Stop making trouble.
I'm not making trouble.Foreman!What are you doing?Come on, stop that!
<i>Monsieur</i> Madeleine is here!<i>What is this fighting all about?
Someone tear these two apart!</i><i>This is a factory, not a circus</i><i>Now, come on, ladies,
settle down</i><i>I am the mayor of this town</i><i>I run a business of repute</i>Deal with this, Foreman.
Be as patient as you can.Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Madeleine.Now, someone say
how this began.<i>At the end of the day
she's the one who began it!</i><i>There's a kid that she's
hiding in some little town</i><i>There's a man she has to pay</i><i>You can guess how
she picks up the extra</i><i>You can bet she's earning
her keep sleeping around!</i><i>And the boss wouldn't like it</i><i>Yes, it's true there's a child
And the child is my daughter</i><i>And her father abandoned
us, leaving us flat</i><i>Now she lives with an
innkeeper man and his wife</i><i>And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that?</i><i>At the end of the day
she'll be nothing but trouble</i><i>And there's trouble for all
when there's trouble for one</i><i>While we're earning
our daily bread</i><i>She's the one with
her hands in the butter</i><i>You must send the slut away or we're
all going to end in the gutter</i><i>And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day!</i><i>I might have known
the bitch could bite</i><i>I might have known
the cat had claws</i><i>I might have guessed
your little secret</i><i>Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine who
keeps herself so pure and clean</i><i>You'd be the cause, I had no
doubt of any trouble hereabout</i><i>You play a virgin in the light</i><i>But need no urging in the night</i><i>She's been laughing at
you while she's having her men!</i><i>She'll be nothing
but trouble again and again!</i><i>You must sack her today!
Sack the girl today!</i><i>Right, my girl On your way</i><i>Monsieur le Maven

Hold that steady.Hold it steady!That's it. That's it.<i>Can this be true?
I don't believe what I see</i><i>A man your age
To be as strong as you are</i><i>A memory stirs</i><i>You make me think of a man</i><i>From years ago</i><i>A man who broke his parole</i><i>He disappeared</i><i>Say what you must
Don't leave it there</i><i>Forgive me, sir
I would not dare</i>How much for this?
It's my daughter's.I'll give you

have a girl who can't refuse?</i><i>Easy money Lying on a bed</i><i>Just as well they never see
The hate that's in your head</i><i>Don't they know they're making
love to one already dead?</i><i>There was a time
when men were kind</i><i>When their voices were soft</i><i>And their words inviting</i><i>There was a time
when love was blind</i><i>And the world was a song</i><i>And the song was exciting</i><i>There was a time</i><i>Then it all went wrong</i><i>I dreamed a dream
in time gone by</i><i>When hope was high
And life worth living</i><i>I dreamed that
love would never die</i><i>I dreamed that God
would be forgiving</i><i>Then I was young and unafraid</i><i>And dreams were made
and used and wasted</i><i>There was no ransom to be paid</i><i>No song unsung,
no wine untasted</i><i>But the tigers come at night</i><i>With their voices
soft as thunder</i><i>As they tear your hope apart</i><i>As they turn
your dream to shame</i><i>He slept a summer by my side</i><i>He filled my days
with endless wonder</i><i>He took my childhood
in his stride</i><i>But he was gone
when autumn came</i><i>And still I dream
he'll come to me</i><i>That we will live
the years together</i><i>But there are dreams
that cannot be</i><i>And there are storms
we cannot weather</i><i>I had a dream my life would be</i><i>So different from
this hell I'm living</i><i>So different now

No? You need to get warm.What do you have for me?Here's our youngest, sir.<i>I don't want you</i>You've got some nerve, you little slut.
You've got some gall.Ow!<i>By Christ, you'll
pay for what you've done</i><i>I guarantee
I'll make you suffer</i><i>I beg you, don't report me, sir</i><i>I'll do whatever you may want</i><i>Make your excuse to the police</i><i>Tell me quickly
what's the story</i><i>Who saw what and why and where?</i><i>Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert</i><i>Javert, would you believe it?
I was lost here in the dark</i><i>When this prostitute attacked me
You can see she left her mark</i><i>She will answer for her actions
If you make a full report</i><i>You may rest assured, monsieur
She will answer to the court</i><i>There's a child
who sorely needs me</i><i>Please, monsieur,
she's but that high</i><i>Holy God, is there no mercy?</i><i>If I go to jail she'll die</i><i>I have heard such protestations
every day for 20 years</i><i>Let's have no more explanations</i><i>Save your breath,
save your tears</i><i>Honest work, just reward</i><i>That's the way
to please the Lord</i><i>A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman's tale</i><i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i><i>You've done your duty,

In such a place as this?</i><i>Monsieur,
don't mock me now, I pray</i><i>It's hard enough
I've lost my pride</i><i>You let your foreman
send me away</i><i>Yes, you were there

my task has just begun</i>I will take her
to the hospital.Monsieur le Mayor.Where is your child?With an innkeeper
in Montfermeil.I will send for her
immediately.<i>I will see it done!</i>Rest.<i>From Paris, monsieur.</i><i>Monsieur le Mayor,
I have a crime to declare!</i><i>I have disgraced
The uniform that I wear</i><i>I've done you wrong
Let no forgiveness be shown</i><i>I've been as hard
On every rogue I have known</i><i>I mistook you for a convict
I have made a false report</i><i>Now I learn they caught the culprit
He's about to face the court</i><i>And of course he now denies
it You'd expect that of a con</i><i>But he couldn't run forever
No, not even Jean Valjean</i><i>You say this man denies it all</i><i>And gives no sign of
understanding or repentance?</i><i>You say this man
is going to trial</i><i>And that he's sure to be
returned to serve his sentence?</i><i>He will pay, and so must I</i><i>Press charges against me, sir</i><i>You have only done your duty</i><i>It's a minor sin at most</i><i>All of us have
made misjudgments</i><i>You'll return, sir,
to your post</i><i>They think that man is me
Without a second glance</i><i>This stranger they have found
This man could be my chance</i><i>Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?</i><i>When I have come so far
and struggled for so long?</i><i>If I speak, I am condemned</i><i>If I stay silent, I am damned!</i><i>I am the master of
hundreds of workers</i><i>They all look to me</i><i>Can I abandon them? How would
they live if I am not free?</i><i>If I speak, they are condemned</i><i>If I stay silent</i><i>I am damned</i><i>Who am I?</i><i>Can I condemn
this man to slavery?</i><i>Pretend I do not
feel his agony?</i><i>This innocent who bears my face</i><i>Who goes to judgment
in my place</i><i>Who am I?</i><i>Can I conceal
myself forevermore?</i><i>Pretend I'm not
the man I was before?</i><i>And must my name until I die
be no more than an alibi?</i><i>Must I lie?</i><i>How can I ever
face my fellow men?</i><i>How can I ever
face myself again?</i><i>My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago</i><i>He gave me hope
when hope was gone</i><i>He gave me
strength to journey on!</i><i>Who am I?</i><i>Who am I?</i><i>I'm Jean Valjean</i><i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i><i>And so,
Your Honor, you see it's true</i><i>This man bears
no more guilt than you!</i><i>Who am I?</i><i>24601!</i><i>Monsieur</i> le Mayor,
you are not well.You must come with me.If you don't believe me,
ask Inspector Javert.You'll find me at the hospital.<i>Cosette, it's turned so cold</i><i>Cosette, it's past your bedtime</i><i>You've played the day away</i><i>And soon it will be night</i><i>Come to me</i><i>Cosette, the light is fading</i><i>Don't you see</i><i>The evening star appearing?</i><i>Come to me</i><i>And rest against my shoulder</i><i>How fast the minutes fly away

with you, Cosette?</i><i>Have you been
too much on your own?</i><i>So many things unclear</i><i>So many things unknown</i><i>In my life</i><i>There are so many
questions and answers</i><i>That somehow seem wrong</i><i>In my life</i><i>There are times when

how sad you seem to me</i><i>Believe me,

are loving and gentle and good</i><i>But Papa, dear Papa</i><i>In your eyes I am still like that
child who was lost in a wood</i><i>No more words</i><i>No more words

for the truth that you know</i><i>Of the years, years ago</i><i>You will learn</i><i>Truth is given by God
to us all in our time</i><i>In our turn</i><i>In my life</i><i>She has burst like the music

knew you wouldn't wait too long</i><i>The faithful servant
at his post once more</i><i>This man's done no wrong
He needs a doctor's care</i><i>I warned you I would not give in!
I won't be swayed!</i><i>Another hour yet Then I'm yours</i><i>All our debts are paid</i><i>The man of mercy comes again
And talks of justice!</i><i>Come, time is running short!</i><i>Look down, Javert</i><i>He's standing in his grave!</i>One more step and you die.<i>Who is this man?
What sort of devil is he?</i><i>To have me caught in a trap
and choose to let me go free?</i><i>It was his hour at last
to put a seal on my fate</i><i>Wipe out the past and wash
me clean off the slate</i><i>AH it would take was
a flick of his knife</i><i>Vengeance was his
and he gave me back my life!</i><i>Damned if I live in
the debt of a thief!</i><i>Damned if I yield at
the end of the chase!</i><i>I am the law and
the law is not mocked!</i><i>I'll spit his pity
right back in his face!</i><i>There is nothing on Earth
that we share!</i><i>It is either Valjean or Javert!</i><i>And my thoughts fly apart</i><i>Can this man be believed?</i><i>Shall his sins be forgiven?</i><i>Shall his crimes be reprieved?</i><i>And must I now begin to doubt</i><i>Who never doubted
all these years?</i><i>My heart is stone
and still it trembles</i><i>The world I have known
is lost in shadow</i><i>Is he from heaven or from hell?</i><i>And does he know</i><i>That granting me my life today</i><i>This man has killed me even so?</i><i>I am reaching but I fall</i><i>And the stars
are black and cold</i><i>As I stare into the void
of a world that cannot hold</i><i>I'll escape now from that world</i><i>From the world of Jean Valjean</i><i>There is nowhere I can turn</i><i>There is no way to go on</i><i>Did
you see them going off to fight?</i><i>Children of the
barricade who didn't last the night</i><i>Did you see them
lying where they died?</i><i>Someone used to cradle them
and kiss them when they cried</i><i>Did you see them
lying side by side?</i><i>There's</i> a <i>grief
that can't be spoken</i><i>There's a pain goes on and on</i><i>Empty chairs at empty tables</i><i>Now my friends
are dead and gone</i><i>Here they talked of revolution</i><i>Here it was they lit the flame</i><i>Here they sang about tomorrow</i><i>And tomorrow never came</i><i>From the table in the corner</i><i>They could see a world reborn</i><i>And they rose
with voices ringing</i><i>And I can hear them now</i><i>The very words
that they have sung</i><i>Became their last communion</i><i>On this lonely barricade</i><i>At dawn</i><i>Oh, my friends,
my friends, forgive me</i><i>That I live and you are gone</i><i>There's a grief
that can't be spoken</i><i>There's a pain goes on and on</i><i>Phantom faces at the windows</i><i>Phantom shadows on the floor</i><i>Empty chairs at empty tables</i><i>Where my friends
will meet no more</i><i>Oh, my friends, my friends</i><i>Don't ask me</i><i>What your sacrifice was for</i><i>Empty chairs at empty tables</i><i>Where my friends will sing</i><i>No more</i><i>Every day you walk
with stronger step</i><i>You walk with longer step
The worst is over</i><i>Don't think about it, Marius!</i><i>With all the years ahead of us!</i><i>I will never go away</i><i>And we will be
together every day</i><i>Every day</i><i>We'll remember that night</i><i>And the vow that we made</i><i>A heart full of love</i><i>She was never mine to keep</i><i>A night full of you</i><i>She is youthful, she is free</i><i>The words are old
but always true</i><i>Cosette, Cosette!</i><i>Love is the garden of the young</i><i>I saw you waiting and I knew</i><i>Thank God you are here</i><i>Waiting for you</i><i>Let it be</i><i>At your feet</i><i>Thank God you are home</i><i>Let it be</i><i>A heart full of love</i><i>And it wasn't a dream</i><i>This I give you this day</i><i>Not a dream after all</i><i>Monsieur, this is a day
I never can forget</i><i>Is gratitude enough
for giving me Cosette?</i><i>Your home shall be with us
And not a day shall pass</i><i>But we will prove our love
To you, whom we shall call</i><i>A father to us both
A father to us all</i><i>Not another word, my son</i><i>There's something now
that must be done</i><i>There lived a man
whose name was Jean Valjean</i><i>He stole some bread to
save his sister's son</i><i>For 19 winters
he served his time</i><i>In sweat
he washed away his crime</i><i>Years ago</i><i>He broke parole and
lived a life apart</i><i>How could he tell Cosette
and break her heart?</i>Marius...<i>It's for Cosette
this must be faced</i><i>If he is caught,
she is disgraced</i><i>The time has come to journey on</i><i>And from this day
he must be gone</i><i>Who am I?</i><i>Who am I?</i><i>You're Jean Valjean</i><i>Monsieur, you cannot leave</i><i>Whatever I tell my beloved
Cosette She will never believe</i><i>Tell her I've gone on a
journey A long way away</i><i>Tell her my heart was
too full for farewells</i><i>It is better this way</i><i>Promise me, monsieur
Cosette will never know</i><i>What I have spoken
Why I must go</i><i>For the sake of Cosette</i><i>It must be so</i>Thank you, Marius.<i>Where's he gone without a word?</i><i>That wouldn't be his way to go</i><i>Why so sudden, why so strange?</i><i>Oh, did he say
how long he'll be gone?</i><i>AH he asked for me to say
is he's on a journey far away</i><i>He can't leave us now</i><i>How he breaks my heart</i><i>And we will never be apart</i>I promise you.The Baron and
Baroness du ThÃ©nard.<i>Go away, Thenardier!</i><i>Do you think
I don't know who you are?</i><i>He's not fooled Told you so</i><i>Show monsieur
what you've come here to show</i><i>Tell the boy what you know</i><i>Pity to disturb you
at a feast like this</i><i>But 500 francs
surely wouldn't come amiss</i><i>In God's name,
say what you have to say</i><i>He speaks You pay!</i><i>What I saw, clear as light</i><i>Jean Valjean in
the sewers one night</i><i>Had this corpse on his back</i><i>Some boy he had killed
in a vicious attack</i><i>I was there, never fear</i><i>I even found me
this fine souvenir</i><i>I know this This is mine</i><i>This is surely
some heavenly sign</i><i>Then it's true Then I'm right</i><i>Jean Valjean was
my savior that night</i><i>Jean Valjean, the old con</i><i>You pay up
or I'll say where he's gone</i>Where is he?Where is he?The convent!Cosette, come with me.
Come with me.<i>Watch the buggers
dance Watch 'em till they drop!</i><i>Keep your wits about you
and you'll stand on top!</i><i>Masters of the land
Always get our share</i><i>Clear away the barricades
and we're still there</i><i>We know where
the wind is blowing</i><i>Money is the stuff we smell</i><i>And when we're rich as Croesus</i><i>Jesus! Won't
we see you all in hell!</i>How dare you!<i>Alone I wait in the shadows</i><i>I count the hours until I sleep</i><i>I dreamed a dream
Cosette stood by</i><i>It made her weep to know I die</i><i>Alone at the end of the day</i><i>Upon this wedding night I pray</i><i>Take these children, my Lord,
to Thy embrace</i><i>And show them grace</i><i>God on high</i><i>Hear my prayer</i><i>Take me now</i><i>To Thy care</i><i>Where You are</i><i>Let me be</i><i>Take me now</i><i>Take me there</i><i>Bring me home</i><i>Bring me home</i>Monsieur, <i>I bless your name</i><i>I am ready, Fantine</i>Monsieur, <i>lay down your burde</i>n<i>At the end of my days</i><i>You raised my child in love</i><i>She's the best of my life</i><i>And you will be with God</i>Oh!Oh...Fantine.<i>Papa, Papa, I do not understand</i><i>Are you all right?
Why did you go away?</i><i>Cosette, my child!
Am I forgiven now?</i><i>Thank God, thank God
I've lived to see this day!</i><i>It's you who must forgive
a thoughtless fool</i><i>It's you who must
forgive a thankless man</i><i>It's thanks to you
that I am living</i><i>And again I lay down
my life at your feet</i><i>Cosette, your father is a saint</i><i>When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade</i><i>Carried like a babe</i><i>And brought me home to you</i><i>Now you are here</i><i>Again beside me</i><i>Now I can die in peace</i><i>For now my life is blessed</i><i>You will live, Papa
You're going to live</i><i>It's too soon
Too soon to say goodbye</i><i>Yes, Cosette,
forbid me now to die!</i><i>I'll obey</i><i>I will try</i><i>On this page</i><i>I write my last confession</i><i>Read it well
when I at last am sleeping</i><i>It's the story</i><i>Of one who turned from hating</i><i>A man who only learned to love</i><i>When you were in his keeping</i>I know it, Papa.<i>Come with me</i><i>Where chains
will never bind you</i>I am ready, Fantine.<i>All your grief
At last, at last behind you</i><i>Lord in heaven</i><i>Look down on him in mercy</i><i>Forgive me all my trespasses</i><i>And take me to Your glory</i><i>Take my hand</i><i>I'll lead you to salvation</i><i>Take my love</i><i>For love is everlasting</i><i>And remember</i><i>The truth that once was spoken</i><i>To love another person</i><i>Is to see the face of God</i><i>Do you hear the people sing

who are climbing to the light</i><i>For the wretched of the Earth</i><i>There is a flame
that never dies</i><i>Even the darkest night will
end and the sun will rise</i><i>We will live again in freedom</i><i>In the garden of the Lord</i><i>We will walk behind the plowshare

men will have their reward!</i><i>Will you join in our crusade?</i><i>Who will be strong
and stand with me?</i><i>Somewhere beyond the barricade</i><i>Is there a world
you long to see?</i><i>Do you hear the people sing?</i><i>Say, do you hear
the distant drums?</i><i>It is the future that we bring
when tomorrow comes!</i><i>Will you join in our crusade?</i><i>Who will be strong

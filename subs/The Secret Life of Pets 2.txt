everywhere âª- âª In New York âª
- âª Yes, hey âªâª Concrete jungle
where dreams are made of âªâª There's nothin'
you can't do, okay âªâª Now you're in New York... âª<i>Ah, kids.</i><i>Everybody loves them, right?</i><i>You probably love kids.</i>- Hey!
- <i>I got to admit...</i><i>...I don't.</i><i>That's me, by the way.
I'm Max.</i><i>I'm the little dog right there,</i><i>grateful I'm not being piled on
by a horde of children.</i>Wait for me!Ugh. Can you believe that?Having a kid looks like fun.Nah, man, it ain't fun.I'm telling you, once
the humans bring a kid home,your life ain't the same.Seen it a billion times.It changes you.âª I'm from the Empire State,
that's... âª<i>Now, I thought I never</i><i>had to worry about any of that,
but then one day...</i>Ow!- <i>...my owner Katie met Chuck.</i>
- Hey.Are you okay?Oh. Uh, yeah.<i>- A little while later, they're married.</i>
- Hi, guys.<i>Which... it-it's great.</i><i>Chuck is really...
he's a good guy.</i><i>But then...</i>- Aw.
- <i>...something happened.</i><i>Katie and Chuck
had a kid of their own.</i><i>His name's Liam.</i><i>At first,
he slept all the time.</i><i>Dreaming about, you know,</i><i>whatever it is
that babies dream about.</i>Who's a cute little baby?<i>He had his place...</i>You little cutie pie.<i>...and I had mine.</i><i>Things seemed like
they were gonna be fine.</i>Wha...?<i>Until he started talking.</i><i>And eventually,
he started crawling.</i><i>Sort of.</i><i>And suddenly, my own home
wasn't safe anymore.</i><i>Th-There was a tiny monster
taking it over.</i><i>Now, I did my best
to keep a safe distance.</i><i>But then, one day,</i><i>Liam did something
I never expected.</i>Max.I love you, Max.<i>And from then on...</i><i>...everything was different.</i>Ah...<i>Duke and I, we became
like role models to him.</i><i>Like, what can I say?
The-the kid's a fan.</i>âª My love blossomed tenderly âªâª My life grew sweeter
through the years âªâª I know that my baby
loves me... âª<i>We try to be a good influence.</i>Whoa!<i>And we help him out
whenever we can.</i>âª Our love just won't end... âª<i>This kid gets us.</i>Bubbles!<i>Yeah, we have fun.</i>Bubbles!<i>And by the way,
I'm still not a kid person.</i><i>I'm talking about this kid.</i><i>This is my kid.</i><i>He's perfect.</i><i>And I'm never gonna let
anything bad happen to him.</i><i>But I got to say, keeping Liam
safe is a full-time job.</i>Ah.No, no, no, no.Uh...Wha...? Ooh.Aah!All right.Uh, hey. Uh, hello.Everything's cool.Uh, we don't...
we don't want any trouble.Liam?You okay there, buddy?Was the world always
this dangerous?Good doggy.No, no, no, no, no, no, no!No.Morning, Snowball.Who's the best bunny

for school.Captain Snowball, you're
in charge while I'm gone.Mwah.First of all, I want to welcome
White Thunder backfrom the washing machine,who was put in there
with a red blanketand henceforth
will be known as...Pink Thunder.Okay, I'm-a go check
the perimeter.Good morning, New York City!Snowball.Hey, Snowball,

Tiny Dog.I'm doing superhero stuff.Thwip, thwip, thwip,
thwip, thwip.Let me tell you something.Anybody comes in here
looking for trouble,oh, they gonna meet
my partners.I'm talking about
Paw and Order.Uh-huh.
Okay, well, you do knowthat your owner is just

some superhero pajamas.Ha! Tiny Dog, you so naive.Point me in the direction
of any animalwho needs my help,
and stand back.Death blow!Okay, okay, uh, I got it.So, uh, did your kid leave
for school yet?Yeah, yeah, no,
she's got a quiz today.Advanced spelling.
She'll ace it, though.You know, she writes
her answers down in ink.That's how confident she is.That sounds really smart.But you know what?
Liam is smart, too.In fact, I heard Katie saythat Liam's head circumference
is in the 80th percentile.Oh, that's cool.
That's a lot of head.Hey, quick question:
Is he still peeing everywhere?Can't control his bladder?Yeah, he-he's... he's peeing.But-but every pet knows,
if you pee on it, you own it.And Liam,
he's just thinking ahead.Yeah, well, you still bettertrain him
before preschool starts.You don't want Liam
to get a reputationas one of those pee-pee kids.Yeah, totally, like...Wait, preschool?Yeah. He's around that age.The baby bird
is leaving the nest, TD.No, no.
Baby bird is staying put.He doesn't need preschool.He'll, you know...stay home with-with me,
where it's safe.Hey, Max.It's, uh, no big deal...
no need to overreact...but, uh, Liam just left.- Wait, what? Where'd he go?
- I don't know.They never tell the dog
specifics.Okay, okay, okay.This is Homebase to all units.The package has
left the building.Does anyone have eyes on him?I don't see him. Over.Well, he's not in
this bag of chips. Over.Okay. Keep... Wait a minute.Why would he be
in a bag of chips?Homebase, this is Eagle Eye.Don't you worry.I had eyes on the packageas soon as he left
the building. Over.Subject is safe and sound,enjoying what looks to be
a cookie shaped like a moose.Here you go. Num-num.No, wait.It's a reindeer.Okay. Thanks, Norman.Scratching again there, buddy.I just...
I really don't like itwhen they take him out
without me.Hey, Duke.Ooh.What's this?Oh, I know this!
It's a ball.Go get it.Hey, Maxie.What say we go for a walk?You know, I got to say,
this is nice.- Good to stretch the... legs.
- No!- I don't want to go to the vet!
- Hmm. Uh...The vet? No!
No, no, no, no, no!Oh, not cool. You tricked me.Maxie, come on, boy.You've been so stressed lately,
but this vet is gonna help you.Let's go, buddy.All right.Aw.- First time here?
- Uh, yeah.Oh, Dr. Francis is the best
veterinarian in the business.You're gonna love him.He specializes
in behavioral disorders.- B-Behavioral disorders?
- Yeah.But I don't have
a behavioral disorder.I-I-I mean... I-I mean,
I worry a little, sure,but it-it's a...
it's a dangerous world.You-you'd be crazy
not to... to worry.Yeah, I'm fine, too.It's my human that's nuts.I mean, you know, I-I bring her
a dead bird, she throws it out.I bring her a dead mouse,right in the garbage!Is nothing I do good enough
for you, Mother?!Okay.I run, and I run,
and I run, and I run,and I get out,
and I've gone nowhere.Nowhere!Uh...My owner always says,
"You're such a good dog,"and I feel like a good dog,but what if, deep down,
I'm a bad dog?What if I'm a bad dog?!We start fires.Max?Come on.I know, buddy.It's just until we can getthis scratching thing
under control, okay?Busy Bee!Max! Max!Max. Max.
You're never gonna believe it.Oh, hey, I like your cone.Listen, I heard Chuck tell Liam
that we're going on a trip.Really?
We're going in the car?We're going in the car!Car, car, car, car, car, car!Man, you know, life is funny.One minute, you're getting
fitted for a cone,and the next,
you get to go in a car!Oh, I feel like that's very
specific to you, but totally.- Yeah.
- This is incredible!I'll be right back.Chloe?Chloe, I'm going on a trip,
and I... Oh.I was wondering if you'd...Will you watch my Busy Bee
while I'm gone...?Oh, hey, Max.

Mm-mm-mm.I'm Captain Snowball.I hear one of you
needs my help.Ooh, that's me.Ah, very good.New dog, tell me your story.Okay.
Well, it all beganwhen I was on my way back
from vacation.<i>Our humans were safely stowed</i><i>in the overhead compartment,</i><i>and we were going through
our owners' stuff.</i><i>Humans always
blame the airline.</i>What do you got?I'll trade you two socks
for a pair of workout shorts.Are they clean or dirty?They ain't clean.Nope. They nasty.<i>And then I heard a noise.</i><i>Now, I don't speak
wild animal...</i><i>...but from what I gathered,</i><i>he was a scared,
adorable tiger cub named Hu.</i>This poor baby kitty was
being held against his will.Whoa.- That is unbelievable.
- I know, right?No, I mean I literally
don't believe a word of it.No offense.
Or do take offense.I'm good either way.Um, pardon me.
Offense is very much taken.That story happened,
and it gets worse.<i>After the plane landed,
I saw Hu again.</i>Use your no-good clown muscles and push!<i>He was being brought
to his new owner.</i>- <i>And this guy...</i>
- Time is rubles!<i>Y'all, this guy was pure,</i><i>concentrated circus evil.</i>That tiger needs
Captain Snowball.- Daisy, let's go.
- Yeah!Let's free that tiger.- Or die trying.
- Well, I mean...- I mean, we might.
- Um...- Probably you.
- Huh?You're wearing a bright suit.
Everyone's gonna notice you.I'll be fine.Hey, guys, we're here.Yay.Hey there.There's Uncle Shep.Welcome to the farm.Where's my little man?Oh, wow!Look at this place.Yeah, it's...Oh, so many smellsI have never smelled before.My nose is so confused.And happy!Come on, Max.
Let's go explore.Oh!- Yeah!
- Uh, wait up.Oh!Hey, cow. Moo.You're a cow.
You're supposed to moo.Woof, woof.What?Oh, I'm a dog.I'm wagging my tail
like an idiot.Oh, okay. Dude, not cool.Oh, are you gonna throw a ball?
Oh, please throw a ball.And I will chase it
because my brainis the size of a rat turd.Okay. Yeah, I get it.You made your point.- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, look. I'm peeing on a tree.- I now own this tree.
- Okay. Yeah, great.- Leaving now. All right.
- I guess I'll just stareat the door
until you come back!Oh, I miss New York.Maybe a break from
the city is just what you need.This place is...Wha...?No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.Duke, what did I do?
What did I do?Huh?Whoa.Dinner's on!Chloe? I need your help.Chloe.Oh. Uh... oh.Uh, Chloe?- Chloe, are you okay?
- Shh.Sorry. Uh, I'm-I'm just...
I'm...Real quick... why is there
a lampshade on your head?Listen, Gidget, baby,I got to be honest with you.My owner might have given me
a little bit of catnip.Oh, okay. Gotcha.That's great. Um, listen.It is great, Gidget.Everything is great...All right.- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?It's like... it's like
a tiny... like a tiny motor.It's like a humming sound.I'm not... don't know
what you're ta...Oh. Chloe, you're purring.That's you.What? That's me?Like, as in the sound
is coming from inside of me?- Yep.
- Oh.I wonder what other sounds
I could make.It-it's just, Max trusted meto look after his Busy Bee,
and then...Chloe, would you listen?Wow. Please stop.Are you finished?This is important.I lost Busy Bee.I got to get it back,
but to do that...Chloe...I need you to teach methe way of the cat.Here we go.
I'm gonna get you.Max, come on.
Try to catch a firefly.I'm just...
That sounds great,but I-I think Liam
wants me near him.You-you know,
he's a little freaked outbeing in this weird place.I think he'll be okay.And this one is a jumper.O-Okay.Just one.Yes, I...Oh.Oh. Hello.Dog's got two things
in this life:his water bowl and his dignity.You take one,
you take the other.I, uh... I-I didn't know
this was your bowl.What?
The cone blocking your view?It's got my name on the side.We are so sorry, Mr. Chicken.Name's not Chicken.Do I look like
a chicken to you?- No. No, sir.
- No, not-not even a little.- Name's Rooster.
- Oh.Okay.
I-I'm Max, and this is...Hey, what's that kid doing
in the cage?There something wrong with him?
He got the fever?Uh, that's-that's Liam.He-he likes to run.So let him run.Well, Liam's super fast.We-we-we blink,
and he's up a tree.So then your kid's up a tree.
What's the problem?Well, he could fall.- He might.
- And then he hurts himself.Oh, so he got really high up
in this hypothetical tree?Kid gets hurt,he learns not to do it again.You know how many
electric cords I've chewed?Like, multiple cords?One.It shocked me.I walked backwards for a week,but I never
chewed a cord again.Well, that is great for you.And-and it explains a lot,but I like to protect Liam
from... everything.Well, that's you,
and you're wrong.Can you believe that guy?Yeah, he was cool!No, he wasn't.I know.
He wasn't cool at all.No, I'll do the dishes.Come on.Let's get this guy inside.Thanks.Whoa. Hold up there.
Dogs sleep outside.- Uh, pardon?
- Huh?Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait, wait.L-L-Let's talk about this
like rational...All right, we're here.In record time, too,
thanks to the Bunnymobile.Oh, yeah!Stealth mode.Let's go!You are jumpy.I meant...
That's cool.Or...Look at that thing
I'm not scared of right there.Or... There's a
candy wrapper on the ground.See? It's just a thing I do.Come on, you stupid tiger!There he is.Let's go.We don't have entire night.Let's go!You're wasting Sergei's time.We got to do something.- Okay, all right, all right.
- Whoa, whoa.Wait.Come on.We try again tomorrow.If tiger does not do trick...tiger will become rug.Do not let tiger
out of your sight.It's okay, Hu.It's me, Daisy, from the plane.Hey.
Step away from the tiger.Mind your business, wolf.Oh!Huh?Ha-ha!Whoa!No!Oh, gonna die,
gonna die, gonna die!Whoa!Huh?I got the keys. Let's go.What?I said, "I got the keys."Come on, let's go.Uh, all right.
Yeah, of course.Heck yeah!Boom.You know what I learned today?- Hmm?
- Wolves are jerks.Duke.Psst. Duke.I think we should
check on Liam.- Duke.
- I finally caught you, tail.Huh? What's that?Okay. Okay.What?Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.No, no, please,
you don't want to eat me.I'm skin and bones. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...Uh... Thanks.He, uh...
he got the jump on me.I guess he...I couldn't see him
because of the cone.- Then get rid of the cone.
- Oh, man, I would.I would, but
my therapist says I need it.Oh. Oh, okay.Well, that makes sense.Yeah, it's a medical device.These doctors.There.You're cured.Hallelujah.Not a fan.I am not a fan of the farm.Okay, tail.Ears.- And voilÃ .
- Whoa.Gidget, you look so much
like a cat, it's crazy.Yeah. Who knew?- So easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.Hold on.
It's gonna take morethan fake ears
and a sock, okay?You got to learn
how to act like a cat.- Okay.
- Okay, Gidge, I'm gonna throwsome situations at you, and
you're just gonna, you know...- you're gonna react like a cat.
- Gotcha.Fetch.- Yes!
- I'm gonna get it!Gidget, stay.- But...
- No.Cats don't care about fetching.
Fetching is for dopes.Yes!You're above that,
because you are a cat.Mm.You see, dogs landlike the clumsy oafs they are.Meanwhile, cats land
on their feet.- Really?
- How do they...Yes! I did it!I landed on my feet.- Yes!
- Nice work.Seriously, guys,
I think I broke something.You gotta.
It's a fact of life.Absolutely not.
Never gonna happen.Guys, I found treats!Oh, Mel. Ugh.Okay, Gidget, eat Sweetpea.What?Cats eat birds.
It's nature.- Yeah, I'm gonna pass.
- No, no, no, no.You used your one pass
on the litter box,so you have to do this.- But...
B-B-B-But... Do it.You're seriously gonna
make her eat Sweetpea?Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.
I'm just freaking her out.Okay. What's next?Gidget, no. That's...Bad dog. Bad cat-dog.Sorry.Up.And tail in the face.Okay, touch the butt
to the cup.Walk on keyboard.There you go.Coffee on computer.And down.Nice.Yes, you got it.Gidget, you're as close
to a cat as a dog can get.Cool.
Now turn me into a chinchilla.Can you do that?Oh, yeah.First mission in the bag.It was easy.Too easy? Maybe.Maybe it was.âª Come along and ride
on a fantastic voyage... âªHey, big fella.What'd I do?
Oh, I just rescued a tiger.No, I'm not even
trying to brag.I'm just telling you
what happened.See, that's the thing
about being awesome.When you awesome
and you just tell the truth,it sounds like you bragging.Let me know when you finish
tooting your horn,'cause we got to find
a safe place for Hu.Uh, what?
What are you talking about?Oh, yeah.Oh, that guy. Yeah.Uh... yeah.Oh! I got it.I know a guy whose owner
is never home.Yeah, we can just
take him there.Sounds like a plan.Superbunny powers, activate.Wait out here, buddy.We'll be right back, okay?âª I'm a puppy cute and sweet âªâª Beg real nice
and get a treat. âªHip, hip, hip,hip, hip, hip.- Hey, Pops.
- Who-who's that?Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny!Oh, uh...I am a hero.
I need you to respect that.All right, all right.Ten-hut!Puppy school is in session.Puppy school?Now the daily pledge.- I promise...

how to be adorable,wide-eyed and loving......and learn how to be
adorable, wide-eyedand loving......to get what I want,
when I want it....to get what I want,when I want it.Okay, now, Pop's quiz.Myron has hidden socks
all over the room.Now, what do we do
with human socks?Ooh, me, me.Go ahead, Princess.We hide them, Mr. Pops.Correct-a-rooney.And why do we hide them?Not knowing where one sock is
messes with the humans' minds.Heck yes, it does.
Always keep 'em guessing.Now, go find those socks.What? Okay, all right.Okay. Hey, Pops.What...? Okay, that's enough.Hey. What's going on?Yeah. My owner got a new puppy.My name's Tiny.Nobody cares!I was teaching Tiny
how not to be anyone's sucker.Word got out,
suddenly every puppyin the tristate area
is scratching at my door.Yeah. Oh.Professor Pops?Yes, Pickles?I got to make a poop.Oh. You know where to do that.
Find a shoe.This is so sweet.Yeah, they're good...Holy cheese and crackers!
What is that?Myron, horn!No, no, no.
No, no, look, look. It's okay.This beautiful creature is Hu.And the good news...is he's staying with you.Get that tiger out of here
before he does any more damage.But we don't have
anywhere else to take him.- Well, he ain't staying here.
- Kitty, kitty,kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty!No, what are you...
Don't get attached.That thing is out.Aw.Oh, Pickles.Did you poop in a shoe?I pooped in a boot.Your owner won't find it

so proud of Pickles.Mr. Pops,please, can the tiger
stay with us?Please?Please.Myron, look away.Oh, flap-doodle.Okay, fine. One night.I taught you guys too well.I give wolves one job.Guard white tiger.And you wolves, you blow it.Maybe I should make

- So fresh.Max.Book, book, book.We're turning it again.Um, I'm sorry, Liam.
We can't read.Well, wait a sec.
There's no reasonwe can't figure this one out
together, right?This first page,there's a little girl
in a red hood,skipping through
the forest with...with some food.Look at that... she's got food.Om, nom, nom.And look at that...she brought the food over to...Hmm. Say, who is that?Oh! Looks like her grandma.Oh, I'll bet you're right.Oh, that is sweet. She...So, Grandma had a pet wolf.They had a great visit.
The little girl went home.No one got eaten.
The end.No, no, no, no.That's not how the story goes.We got this, thanks.That wolf was gonna eat
the little girl.Nope! Thank you, Rooster.He already ate Grandma.And then he assumed
the old lady's identity.No.Wha...? Hey.
Don't freak out my kid.Take that, Mr. Wolfy.Kid seems fine to me.You're the one
who's scared of everything.I am not. I'm-I'm...
Tell him, Duke.Yeah, yeah.

don't you ignore me.Ah, come on.Yep, uh-huh.Now go and do the front.
No, no, back.Now go to the side.Uh, Max, Rooster nips at
the cows to get 'em to move.Really?
That sounds drastic, but...okay, pig, you asked for this.Oh.- Hey, Max. You okay?

don't believe that...about a wish coming true...
do you?Well, I didn't, either.Of course, I'm just a cricketsinging my way
from hearth to hearth,but... let me tell you
what made me change my mind.One night a long time...Pardon me.Wait till
I fix this thing here.There.One night a long time ago,my travels took me
to a quaint little village.It was a beautiful night.The stars were shining
like diamondshigh above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.Pretty as a picture.As I wandered along
the crooked streets,there wasn't a soul to be seen.The only sign of life was
a lighted windowin the shop of a woodcarver
named Geppetto.So... I hopped over......and looked in.It was a shame to see a nice,
cheerful fire like thatgoin' to waste.So what do I do?I go in.I looked around.Of course, being
in a strange place like that,I didn't know what to expect.A cricket can't be too careful,
you know.Soon as I saw
there was no one about,I made myself at home.As I stood there warming my...
myself,I took a look around.Well, sir, you never saw
such a place...the most fantastic clocks
you ever laid your eyes on,and all carved out of wood.And cute, little music boxes...
each one a work of art.And shelf after shelf of toys
and...and then something else
caught my eye...a puppet.You know... one of those
marionette things.All strings and joints.Cute little fella.Goin' up!Good piece of wood, too.Well, now.It won't take much longer.Just a little more paint,
and he's all finished.I think he'll be all right,don't you, Figaro?Beg pardon.See?That makes a big difference.Very good.Very, very...Well, you can't please
everybody.Now I have just the name
for you... Pinocchio.Do you like it, Figaro?No?You do, don't you, Cleo?Well, we'll leave it
to little wooden head.Do you like it?That settles it!Pinocchio it is!Come on, now!
We'll try you out.Music, professor!Take it easy, there!Break it up, will ya?Lot of downbeats in there.<i>Little wooden head,</i>
<i>go play your part</i><i>Bring a little joy</i>
<i>to every heart</i><i>Little do you know,</i>
<i>and yet it's true</i><i>That I'm mighty proud</i>
<i>of you</i><i>Little wooden feet</i>
<i>and best of all</i><i>Little wooden seat</i>
<i>in case you fall</i>How graceful!<i>M y little wooden head</i>Cleo, meet Pinocchio.Say, "How do you do?"Say hello to Figaro.Up to mischief already!You see what happens?Up we go!You're a cute little fellow.And that smile...You know, I...You rascal.
Jealous, huh?You know, Pinocchio,I think Figaro is jealous
of you.Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.I wonder what time it is.It's getting late.Come now.
We go to bed.Good night, Pinocchio.Little funny face.Good night, Cleo,
my little water baby.You say good night, too.Go on.Now, go to sleep,
my little mermaid.Good night.This is my idea of comfort.Silent comfort.Look at him, Figaro.He almost looks alive.Wouldn't it be nice
if he was a real boy?Oh, well.Come on.We go to sleep.I forgot to open the window.Oh, Figaro, look!Look! A wishing star!Starlight, star bright,first star I see tonight...I wish I may,
I wish I mighthave the wish
I make tonight.Figaro, you know what I wish?I wish that my little Pinocchio
might be a real boy.Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!A real boy!A very lovely thought...but not at all practical.A real......boy.Quiet!!After all, enough's enough.Now what's up?Hey!
What's goin' on here?!As I live and breathe...
a fairy!Good Geppetto,you have given so much happiness
to others.You deserve to have
your wish come true.Little puppet
made of pine...wake.The gift of life is thine.What they can't do these days.I can move!I can talk!I can walk!Yes, Pinocchio.
I've given you life.Why?Because tonight Geppetto
wished for a real boy.Am I a real boy?No, Pinocchio.To make Geppetto's wish
come truewill be entirely up to you.Up to me?Prove yourself brave,
truthful, and unselfish,and someday you will be
a real boy.A real boy!That won't be easy.You must learn to choose
between right and wrong.Right and wrong?But how will I know?How will he know?Your conscience
will tell you.What are conscience?What are conscience?Well, I'll tell ya!A conscience is that still,
small voicethat people won't listen to.That's just the trouble
with the world today.Are you my conscience?Who, me?Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?Well... I...Very well.What is your name?Cricket's the name.Jiminy Cricket.Kneel, Mr. Cricket.No tricks, now.I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience,Lord High Keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong,counselor in moments
of temptation,and guide along
the straight and narrow path.Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.Well! My, my!Say, that's pretty swell!Gee, thanks.But don't I get
a badge or somethin'?Well, we'll see.You mean maybe I will?I shouldn't wonder.Make it a gold one?Maybe.Now, remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.And always let your
conscience be your guide.Goodbye, milady.Goodbye!Not bad, says I.Oh, yeah.Almost forgot about you.Well, Pinoke...Maybe you and I had better have
a little heart-to-heart talk.Why?Well, you want to be
a real boy, don't you?All right.Sit down, son.Now, you see, the world
is full of temptations.Temptations?Yep... temptations.They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time.But even though
the right thingsmay seem wrong sometimes,sometimes the wrong things
may be rightat the wrong time
or vice versa.Understand?But I'm gonna do right!Attaboy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.And anytime you need me,
you know, just whistle,like this...Like this?No, no.
Try it again, Pinoke.Like this?No, son.Now, listen.That's it!Come on, now!
Let's sing it!<i>When you get in trouble and</i><i>You don 't know</i>
<i>right from wrong</i><i>Give a little whistle</i><i>Give a little whistle</i><i>When you meet temptation</i>
<i>and the urge is very strong</i><i>Give a little whistle</i><i>Give a little whistle</i><i>Not just a little squeak</i><i>Pucker up and blow</i><i>And if your</i>
<i>whistle's weak, yell</i>Right!<i>Take the straight</i>
<i>and narrow path</i><i>And if you start to slide</i><i>Give a little whistle</i><i>Give a little whistle</i><i>And always let your</i>
<i>conscience be your guide</i><i>Take the straight</i>
<i>and narrow path</i><i>And if you start to slide,</i>
<i>give a little whistle</i><i>Give a little whistle</i><i>And always let</i>
<i>your conscience be your guide</i><i>And always let</i>
<i>your conscience be your guide</i>Look out, Pinoke!Who's there?!It's me!Oh. It's me.There's somebody in here!Carefully, now, Figaro.He might spring out on us
at any time.He's in here somewhere.Here I am!How did you get down here?I fell down.Oh, you did, hmm?You are talking!No!Yes!
And I can move, too!No, no, no! You can't!
I'm dreaming in my sleep!Wake me up! Wake me up!Now we see who's dreaming.Go on... say something.Gee, you're funny.Do it again!You do talk!Yes!
The Blue Fairy came...The Blue Fairy?- And I got a conscience!
- A conscience?And someday,
I'm gonna be a real boy!A real boy!
It's my wish!It's come true!Figaro, look!He's alive! He can talk!Say hello to Figaro.Hello to Figaro.I almost forgot!Look! It's Pinocchio!She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?Yeah. Cute.This calls for a celebration!Music!You start one, Pinocchio!Oh, boy! A party!Mind if I cut in?How 'bout sittin' out
the next one, babe, huh?Let me out!
Let me out!Come, Cleo!
It's time to party! Dance!Nice!<i>Gathering toys</i><i>For my little boy</i>Look! Pretty!Where's a bucket?!Get water!Where's a bucket?Here it is! I got it!
Here's water!Here's some water!Help! Where's water?That was close.Maybe we'd better go to bed
before something else happens.Little man,
you've had a busy night.Now close your eyes
and go to sleep.Why?Oh, everybody has to sleep.Figaro goes to sleep,
and Cleo and...and besides, tomorrow
you've got to go to school.Why?Oh, to learn things and...and get smart.Why?Because.Oh, look, Father!

stupid world be without...Well, well, well!So that old rascal's
back in town, eh?Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on youand passed you off
as a puppet?We nearly put one over
on that old gypsy that time.A little wooden boy.Now, who...A wooden boy!Look, Giddy. Look.It's amazing!A live puppet without strings.A thing like that ought to be
worth a fortune to someone.Now, let me see...That's it... Stromboli!Why, that fat, old faker
would give his...Listen!If we play our cards right,
we'll be on Easy Street,or my name
isn't Honest John.Quick!
We'll head him off.Now's our...No, no, stupid.Don't be crude.Let me handle this.
Here he comes.Ah, yes, Giddy,as I was saying to
the duchess only yesterday...Oh, how clumsy of me!Oh, how clumsy of me!Oh, my, my, my, my.Oh, I'm terribly sorry.Oh, I do hope
you're not injured.I'm all right.Oh, splendid.Well, well.Quite the scholar, I see.Look, Giddy.

of the easy road to success.No?I'm speaking, my boy,
of the theater!Here's your apple.Bright lights! Music!
Applause!Fame!- Fame?
- Yes!And with that personality,
that profile, that physique,why, he's a natural-born
actor, eh, Giddy?- And I'm going...
- Straight to the top.Why, I can see your name

between here and school.Oh, boy! A parade!<i>An actor's life for me</i><i>An actor's life for me</i><i>A wax mustache</i>
<i>and a beaver coat</i><i>A pony cart and a billy goat</i>Why, it's Pinoke!- Hey! Where you goin'?

about temptation?Well, that's him.Oh, no, Jiminy!That's Mr. Honest John.Honest John?Get me outta here!Get me outta here!All right, then.Here's what we'll tell 'em...
you can't go to the theater.Say thank you just the same.You're sorry, but you've
got to go to school.Here they come, Pinoke.
Now, you tell 'em.Oh, little boy...Ah, there you are!Oh, where were we?Ah, yes.
On to the theater!Goodbye, Jiminy! Goodbye!Goodbye? Huh?!- <i>An actor's life for me</i>
- Goodbye?!Hey, Pinoke!
You can't...There he goes.Oh, what'll I do?I'll run and tell his father.No. That would be snitchy.
I'll go after him myself.Ladies and gentlemen,to conclude the performance
of this great show,Stromboli the Master Showman...that's me...and by special permission
of the management...that's me, too...is presenting to yousomething you will absolutely
refuse to believe.Well, looks like a sellout.Introducing...the only marionette
who can sing and danceabsolutely without the aids
of strings!The one-and-only Pinocchio!What a buildup.<i>I've got no strings</i>
<i>to hold me</i>...Go ahead.
Make a fool of yourself.Then maybe you'll listen
to your conscience.<i>I've got no strings</i>
<i>to hold me down</i><i>To make me fret</i>
<i>or make me frown</i><i>I had strings,</i>
<i>but now I'm free</i><i>There are no strings on me</i><i>That's the only way to be</i><i>I want the world to know</i>
<i>nothing ever worries me</i><i>I've got no strings,</i>
<i>so I have fun</i>What I told you, huh?!<i>They've got strings,</i>
<i>but you can see</i><i>There are no strings on me</i><i>You have no strings,</i>
<i>your arms is free</i><i>To love me</i>
<i>by the Zuider Zee</i><i>Ja, ja, ja,</i>
<i>if you would woo</i><i>I'd bust my strings for you</i><i>You've got no strings,</i>
<i>comme ci, comme ça</i><i>Your savoir-faire is</i>
<i>ooh la la</i><i>I've got strings,</i>
<i>but entre nous</i><i>I'd cut my strings for you</i><i>Down where the Volga flows</i><i>There's a Russian rendezvous</i><i>Where me and Ivan go</i><i>But I'd rather go</i>
<i>with you, hey</i><i>There are no strings on me</i>They like him.He's a success.Gosh, maybe I was wrong.Well...guess he won't need me anymore.What does an actor want
with a conscience anyway?What could have
happened to him?Where could he be
at this hour?I'd better go out again
and look for him.And remember...nobody eats a bite...
until I find him.<i>I got no strings,</i>
<i>but I got the brain</i><i>I got no strings,</i>
<i>but I got the brain</i><i>I buy a new suit</i>
<i>and I swing the cane</i><i>I eat the best</i>
<i>and I drink champagne</i><i>I got no strings on me</i>Bravo, Pinocchio!They liked me.200.You are sensational!You mean I'm good?300.You are colossal!Does that mean I'm an actor?Sure! I will push you
in the public's eye!Your face... she will be
on everybody's tongue!Will she?Yeah.What's this?!For you,
my little Pinocchio.For me? Gee, thanks!I'll run right home
and tell my father.Home?Oh, sure!Going home to your father!Oh, that is very comical!You mean it's funny?Sure!I'll be back in the morning.Be back in the morning?!Going home!There!This will be your home!Where I can find you always.No!

You can't...Quiet!Shut up before
I knock you silly!Good night...my little wooden gold mine.No! No, wait!Let me out!
I'll tell my father!Get along, then!Ah, Jiminy, where are you?!Well, there he goes...sitting in the lap of luxury,
the world at his feet.Oh, well, I can always say
I knew him when.I'll just go
out of his life quietly.I would like to wish him luck,
though.Sure. Why not?It's me... your old friend
Jiminy, remember?Gee, I'm glad to see ya!What's happened?!What did he do to you?Oh, he was mad!He said he was gonna push
my face in everybody's eye!And just 'cause
I'm a goldbrick,he's gonna chop me
into firewood!Oh, is that so?Now, don't you worry, son.I'll have you out of here
in no time at all.Why, this is just as easy
as rolling off a...Kinda rusty.Needs a little oil.Needs a little oil...Well, that's what I said.Must be one of the old models.You mean you can't open it?Yeah.Looks pretty hopeless.It'll take a miracle
to get us out of here.A fine conscience
I turned out to be.I should've
listened to you, Jiminy.No. It was my fault.I shouldn't have
walked out on you.Guess I'll never see
my father again.Oh, buck up, son.It could be worse.Be cheerful...like me!Take it easy, son.Come on... blow.Attaboy.Oh, well...It stopped raining, anyway.Hey, that star again!The lady!The fairy!What'll she say?What'll I tell her?Well, you might
tell her the truth.Why, Pinocchio...Hello.Sir Jiminy...Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.Pinocchio, why didn't
you go to school?School?Well, I...Go ahead. Tell her.I was going to school
till I met somebody.Met somebody?Yeah.
Two big monsters...with big, green eyes.Why...Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?No, ma'am, but they tied me
in a big sack.You don't say!And where was Sir Jiminy?Leave me out of this.They put him in a little sack.No!Yeah!- How did you escape?
- I didn't.They chopped me into firewood!Oh, look! My nose!What's happened?Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth, Pinocchio.- Perhaps?
- Oh, but I have.Every single word!Oh, please, help me.
I'm awful sorry.You see, Pinocchio, a lie
keeps growing and growinguntil it's as plain
as the nose on your face.She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.I'll never lie again...
honest, I won't.Please, Your Honor...I mean, Miss Fairy.Give him another chance...for my sake, will ya?I'll forgive you this once,
but remember...a boy who won't be goodmight just as well
be made of wood.We'll be good, won't we?Very well. But this is
the last time I can help you.Gee, look, Jiminy... my nose!Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke.<i>I buy a new suit</i>

we're his friends.And did Stromboli pay?Plenty.That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop...Now, Coachman...what's your proposition?Well...How would you blokes like
to make some real money?Well!
And who do we have to...No, no.Nothing like that.You see...I'm collecting
stupid little boys.Stupid little boys?You know, the disobedient oneswho want to play hooky
from school.And you see...Yes.And I takes 'em
to Pleasure Island.Ah, Pleasure Island.Pleasure Island?!But the law!
Suppose they...No, no.
There's no risk.They never come back...as boys!Now... I've got a coach load

I'm going...Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.That's it!
You are a nervous wreck!We must diagnose this case

contraptionsof the flying trapezes.Say "hippopotamus."Hippopotamus.I knew it!Compound transmission
of the pandemoniumwith percussion and spasmodic
frantic disintegration.Close your eyes.
What do you see?Nothing.- Open 'em. Now what do you see?

only one cure.A vacation on Pleasure Island!Pleasure Island?Yes... that happy land

to be back on...dry land.Come on. Let's get home.Father! Father, I'm home!We're home, Mr. Geppetto!
Home again!It's me... Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay!Here he is, Mr. Geppetto!
Home at last!Hey, maybe he's asleep.Father!Father, it's me!Pinoke, come here.Look.He ain't here.He's gone.Yeah, and Figaro.And Cleo, too.Maybe somethin' awful
happened to him.Don't worry, son.
He probably hasn't gone far.It's a message.What's it say?It's about your father.Where is he?Why, it says here...he went looking for you,
and he was swallowed by a whale.Swallowed by a whale?!Yeah...A whale?!A whale named Monstro!Oh, he's...But wait. He's alive.Alive? Where?Inside the whale
at the bottom of the sea.Bottom of the sea?!Hey! Where you goin'?!I'm going to find him!But, Pinoke, are you crazy?!Don't you realize
he's in a whale?I gotta go to him.Hey, Pinoke! Wait!Listen here, son!But this Monstro...
I've heard of him.He's a whale of a whale!Why, he swallows
whole ships alive!Tie it good and tight, now.And besides, it's dangerous.Bye, Jiminy.Goodbye?I may be live bait down there,

this way, Figaro...starving to death...in the belly of a whale.My poor little Pinocchio.He was such a good boy.It's hopeless, Figaro.There isn't a fish left.If the monster doesn't
wake up soon...I'm afraid we are done for.Here they come!Tuna!Oh, tuna fish!Food! We'll eat!Here's a big one.Get them in there, Figaro!Wait!Wait a minute!

Oh, no, no, son.I've tried every way.Why, I even built a raft!A raft?That's it.We'll take the raft,and when the whale
opens his mouth...No, no, no, no.

when he's eating.Then everything comes in.Nothing goes out.It's hopeless, Pinocchio.Come, we'll make a nice fire,and we'll cook
some of the fish.A fire! That's it!Yes, and then we'll all
eat again.A great big fire!Lots of smoke!Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.A smoked fish
will taste good.Quick... some wood!Pinocchio, not the chair!Hurry, Father! More wood!Oh, what will we sit on

you will be a real boy.Awake, Pinocchio.Awake.Father!Whatcha cryin' for?'Cause... you're dead,
Pinocchio.No! No, I'm not!Yes, yes, you are.Now lie down...But, Father, I'm alive.

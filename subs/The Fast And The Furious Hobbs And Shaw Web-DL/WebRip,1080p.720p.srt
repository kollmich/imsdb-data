1
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,064
All right,Touch down in two.

2
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,039
Rules of engagement:
Electric rounds only.

3
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,442
MI6 wants him alive
for questioning.

4
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,450
The target's in a metal copper.

5
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:50,996
Every agency and terror
cell is looking for it.

6
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,866
Asset secured.

7
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,736
MI6.

8
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,213
Freeze!

9
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,537
Whoa, whoa! I'm a fan.
Fantastic job.

10
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:18,452
And I think you look amazing
in your matching outfits.

11
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,358
Who the hell are you?

12
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:21,942
Bad guy.

13
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,973
Get on the ground, now!

14
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:32,692
Nah.

15
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:10,546
Buggered up, too.

16
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,250
The team is down.

17
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:13,944
We've been betrayed.

18
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:16,213
She took the virus.

19
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:30,707
One of the soldiers
got away with the virus.

20
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,508
I want her on the run
with no place to turn.

21
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,888
She is a... a wily one.

22
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:43,255
Monitor all channels and make
sure the takes the fall for it.

23
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:45,130
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:47,114
What do you want us to
do with these arseholes?

25
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:49,091
Clean it up. I don't care.

26
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:50,325
No witnesses.

27
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,064
I'm gonna get it back.

28
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:55,103
Who's gonna stop me?

29
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,321
- Where?
- Where?

30
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:42,366
Who the hell are you?

31
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:43,764
Ooh.

32
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:46,975
I'm what you call a nice,
cold can of whoop-ass.

33
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,577
Who the hell are you?

34
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:01,632
I'm what you might call
a champagne problem.

35
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,445
What you got, big man?

36
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,823
Well, you thought
that would've broke.

37
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:48,300
Uh-uh.

38
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:54,339
I'm gonna kill you!

39
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:55,722
You gonna die!

40
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:14,055
All right, all right.
No, no, no, no.

41
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:15,757
That's my favorite jacket,
don't do that.

42
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,220
Hi, sweetheart, could you
pass me that gun, please?

43
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:20,064
Thank you very much.

44
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,204
Nice tats.

45
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,446
All right, assclown,
we're gonna play a little game.

46
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,626
It's called hangman.

47
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,087
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

48
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,845
When you give me an
answer I don't like...

49
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:31,227
Okay. You get the idea.

50
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:32,664
I've been tracking
some dark web chatter

51
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:35,306
about a super virus that's
comin' up on the auction block.

52
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:36,962
Why don't you tell me about it?

53
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,017
I swear, I don't-I don't know!

54
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,423
I don't like that answer.

55
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:45,157
A little bird told me
about a shadow outfit.

56
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:47,296
Black tech. Blood ops.

57
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:49,169
Real arseholes.

58
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,287
Like you.

59
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,451
They're called Eteon.

60
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,089
And you're gonna tell
me where to find them.

61
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,104
You're not gonna tell me

62
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,745
because I'm hanging
you out the window.

63
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:57,363
You gonna tell me...

64
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,284
because I'm the guy
willing to drop you.

65
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,236
All right, bonus round.

66
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,181
Where's the virus?

67
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,761
No! No, wait!

68
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,253
Don't leave me out here!

69
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,337
Please!

70
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:15,557
Don't leave me!

71
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,105
Don't leave me!

72
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:22,191
What did he write?

73
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,476
A... A... A...

74
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:43,820
Excellent. Oh, and by the way,

75
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,797
your Old Man and the Sea report?

76
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:46,876
- Mm-hmm?
- From last week?

77
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,243
You did so good. It was awesome.

78
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:49,900
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yes.

79
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:51,056
What's that?

80
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,915
Um, it's a social studies assignment.

81
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:57,087
It's a family tree.

82
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:59,259
It's just a sketch.

83
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:01,024
Oh, yeah!

84
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,923
That's our family tree
right there, it's, uh...

85
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:08,806
It's... super easy to
read and very clear.

86
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,923
Yeah.

87
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,572
Uh... I was going to use this.

88
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:19,025
I found it in the garage drawer.

89
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:21,720
That's you, isn't' it?

90
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:24,822
Who's Jonah?

91
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,298
I-Is that your brother?

92
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:30,876
Yup, that's my brother.

93
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,369
Why don't you ever
talk about Samoa?

94
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:35,939
Did something happen?

95
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:37,978
In life, things happen.

96
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:40,782
You may not want them to, but...

97
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,313
they do.

98
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,119
You just got to do your best...

99
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:48,650
and move on.

100
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:50,515
The fact of the matter is,

101
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,609
I'm your family...
I'm your people...

102
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,155
Me.

103
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,171
- And you're a whole lot.
- Oh, I am a whole lot.

104
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,335
Look at this, perfect timing.

105
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:03,288
Oh, no, this is for the mini.

106
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:05,413
Thank you so much.

107
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:06,865
Cheat day?

108
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,546
Cheat day, yeah!

109
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,280
Thank you so much.

110
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,349
Is that really necessary?

111
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,967
Come on, she's 71 years old.

112
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,249
What's the matter with you lot?

113
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:21,343
Sir, the prisoner will only
be allowed more leniency

114
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,640
when she proves to be
less of a security risk.

115
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,374
If someone leaves
the back door open,

116
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:27,046
it's a bit daft
not to try and use it.

117
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,410
What's daft is paying one of
the screws to leave it open...

118
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:31,355
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

119
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah, well,
my point still stands.

120
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,652
If you can't break out
of a shitty prison like this,

121
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,286
then you're seriously
slippin', Mum.

122
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:38,793
You cheeky bugger.

123
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,145
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?

124
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,530
What, the one with the file in it?

125
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:43,627
I ain't bakin' it.

126
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:44,799
Who wants a bloody file?

127
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,932
What I want
is a nice little bit of C-4.

128
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,183
Listen, if you want out of here,

129
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,081
just say the word.
I'll handle it.

130
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:53,379
Decks, I'm just having
a bit of fun, really.

131
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,168
Being banged up doesn't bother me.

132
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:56,901
I quite enjoy the
peace and quiet.

133
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,254
You know, nice walk,
a bit of reading.

134
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,573
Loads of sudoku.

135
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,448
Like being retired. Love it!

136
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,534
Now, listen...

137
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,792
Have you spoken
with your sister?

138
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:08,229
You know I haven't, Mum.

139
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,104
- Give me your hand.
- Here she goes.

140
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,933
I mean, you and your sister,
you used to be inseparable.

141
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:15,480
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?

142
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:18,932
I remember you, Owen and Hattie
playing out in the backyard.

143
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,651
Your little games,
your little grifts, ooh.

144
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:23,147
Robbing banks.

145
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,326
You used to give your
little scams code names,

146
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:26,395
do you remember?

147
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,936
Oh, what was that one? Um...

148
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:29,147
The Keith Moon.

149
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,625
Yeah, that's right.

150
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:33,240
It was called the
Keith Moon because it...

151
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,280
Involved lots of
explosive percussion

152
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,709
and permanent ear damage.

153
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,487
That's my boy.

154
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,145
No wonder we left
the family business.

155
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:51,133
She loves you, you know.

156
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:53,845
All you got to do
is pick up the phone, Decks...

157
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,189
Look at me.

158
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:56,908
You're her big brother.

159
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,918
She looks up to you.

160
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:00,183
Used to.

161
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:04,434
Well...

162
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,949
One day, I just hope
that I walk through that door

163
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,363
and I see the two of you
sitting there.

164
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:11,980
How many years you got left?

165
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,746
Two, with good behavior.

166
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,988
How many really?

167
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,059
Four.

168
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:20,209
Well, you know what I say.

169
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:22,123
Never say never.

170
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:24,154
Time's up.

171
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:26,061
You behave yourself.

172
00:13:26,154 --> 00:13:27,811
Will do. Love you, darling.

173
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,076
Love you, too.

174
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,652
Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

175
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:49,839
I haven't seen you in forever.

176
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:51,394
- Rebecca?
- Do you even age?

177
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:52,550
How long has it been?

178
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,723
Six months.

179
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,145
- Time flies.
- When we're apart.

180
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,233
What is your skincare regimen?

181
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:59,975
Because you look like
a young Shirley Temple.

182
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,075
Go, go, go, go, go.

183
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,537
Daddy, who is this guy?

184
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:05,358
Well, this guy is, uh, is Locke.

185
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,334
And he works for the CIA.

186
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,920
- Your dad and I are old friends.
- We're not old friends.

187
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:11,139
Actually, we're, um...

188
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:13,962
We're best friends.
Here's the half heart.

189
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,142
I don't know what that is.

190
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,118
We got some ink together.

191
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:17,877
- We did not get ink together.
- Oh, we didn't?

192
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:19,517
- No, we did not.
- Oh, interesting.

193
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:22,102
Well, I seem to remember
getting a little something like...

194
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:24,883
this... at one point on my body.

195
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:25,790
Jesus.

196
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,337
Christ, I miss our playful banter.

197
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,798
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

198
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:30,039
before I knock one
of your lungs loose.

199
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,899
You and I
are after the same thing.

200
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,305
Say hello to the CT17 virus.

201
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:37,329
It's a programmable bio-weapon
of biblical proportions

202
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,798
affectionately
codenamed the Snowflake.

203
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,141
What does a Snowflake do?

204
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:42,524
Oh, nothing much, just, uh...

205
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,079
liquifies your internal organs.

206
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,392
Basically, it turns
your body into a

207
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,798
giant bag of hot soup.

208
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,202
She is nine!

209
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:49,337
- I've seen worse.
- Where?

210
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,290
Game of Thrones, Janet's house.

211
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,343
- I've never...
- A Lannister always pays his debts.

212
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,632
You're never going
over there again.

213
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,758
But there's a new wrinkle
in the case, Rebecca.

214
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,657
The specifics...

215
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:00,758
are all in the brief.

216
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,281
There you go.

217
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,640
She's ready, Becca.

218
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:04,696
She's nine.

219
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:07,664
This is the only unit
of CT17 in existence.

220
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:09,024
And this Snowflake...

221
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:12,133
is now in the hands of a
rogue MI6 operative in London.

222
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,414
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

223
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,748
No, she is unusually attractive.

224
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:18,828
And deadly.

225
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,695
Last night, she was
part of an MI6 team

226
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,125
tasked with securing the virus.

227
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:25,008
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

228
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,883
She stabbed
one guy in the chest...

229
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:28,422
using a brick.

230
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,867
Do you know how hard that is?

231
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:30,937
To stab someone...

232
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,312
- using a brick?
- Get to the point.

233
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:33,828
The point is
there's no sharp edge.

234
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,272
How did she get an entire brick

235
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:36,750
into another person's chest?

236
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,313
She either had to be
really strong,

237
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,634
or the other person had to
have been, like, born without...

238
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:42,001
like, bones.

239
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,245
Get to the larger point.

240
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,620
She stole the Snowflake.

241
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:45,901
She went totally off-grid.

242
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:46,916
Who's this?

243
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:48,406
That's the scientist who we
believe created the virus.

244
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,086
Great. Where do I find him?

245
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:51,167
He's off-grid, too.

246
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,518
Impossible to find.

247
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,314
- Maybe dead.
- You're very helpful, Locke.

248
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:55,831
And you're the
world's best tracker.

249
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:57,681
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

250
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,776
Oh, no, no, no, no.

251
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,346
I'm DSS, you're CIA.
I don't work for you.

252
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,612
Your boss loaned you out.

253
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:03,939
You do now, dickface.

254
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:04,990
- What did you call me?
- Hey, hey, hey!

255
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,044
Let's just settle down.

256
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,051
All right?

257
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:08,669
I've already got a
black site running in London.

258
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,395
There's an operative there.
Top of his game.

259
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,488
He'll be your contact.

260
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,115
I don't need anybody else.
I work alone.

261
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:15,255
We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego.

262
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,083
Or the fact that a moment ago,
I most definitely shit my pants.

263
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:22,243
The entire world
is at stake here, all right?

264
00:16:22,268 --> 00:16:23,368
This thing gets out,

265
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:25,073
we're looking at a lot
of liquified organs.

266
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:27,010
And I mean, like, everywhere.

267
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,997
And not just yours and mine.

268
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,931
Uh, he knows
I can see him, right?

269
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:37,033
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

270
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:40,861
So, what's it gonna be, Becky?

271
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:42,384
You gonna partner up?

272
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,424
- I'm in.
- 'Course you are.

273
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,816
Do you remember what
I told you in Rwanda?

274
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,798
"Still burns?"

275
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:48,791
No. The other thing.

276
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,766
"Stop watching me sleep."

277
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,971
I said...

278
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,705
- "We are not friends at all."
- Best friends.

279
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,111
- And to watch your...
- Wash your back. Yeah.

280
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,657
- I remember.
- Watch your back.

281
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,587
A lot of back. I gotcha. Hey...

282
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:01,422
Same old Hobbs. Huh?

283
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,510
Same old Locke.

284
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,377
All right, who's on the case?

285
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,380
Mr. Shaw.

286
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:16,943
Whatever it is,
I ain't buyin' it.

287
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:18,739
You don't know what I'm selling
or who I am.

288
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:19,778
CIA.

289
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,997
- How can you...?
- Sunglasses, cloudy day.

290
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:23,489
Sensible shoes.

291
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,318
Okay, well, these are-I have

292
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:27,311
fallen arches and I don't
have a lot of choice to what...

293
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:28,990
Anyway, uh, I'm Agent Loeb.

294
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,016
- And I need to talk to you about...
- Hey, how'd you find me?

295
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,836
I got a tip from an
acquaintance or yours.

296
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,032
Mr. Nobody.

297
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:35,204
Mr. Nobody.

298
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:37,227
A little joke for you, Loeb.

299
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:41,265
What do CIA operatives and
baseballs have in common?

300
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,523
People cheer when you
hit them with a bat.

301
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:44,593
No.

302
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,327
They are two things

303
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,984
I don't give a toss about.

304
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,385
That works too.

305
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,822
The weapon she's stolen is not
like anything we've ever seen.

306
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:02,361
It's a programmable disease that
can target any DNA sequence

307
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,594
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

308
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:07,094
If MI6 finds her,

309
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,639
they're gonna treat
her like a traitor.

310
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:10,930
We need you to
surrender the virus.

311
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,712
What is your location?

312
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:17,680
What, you think I killed them?

313
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:19,188
But if you can help us find her...

314
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,821
if you bring us the virus...

315
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,305
we'll grant her immunity.

316
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,147
We've set up a black site
here in London.

317
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:30,318
You've got everything you
could need at your disposal.

318
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,053
And we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

319
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:34,592
I don't need anybody.

320
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,186
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw...

321
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,827
but she does.

322
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,209
My guy's in.

323
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:44,405
My guy's in, too.

324
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:45,788
Hey, is your guy gonna freak out

325
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:46,967
when he finds out who my guy is?

326
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,678
I mean, didn't they just do
a job together in New York?

327
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,850
And didn't they just destroy
the DSS field office in L.A.

328
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:52,272
by throwing each
other through it?

329
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:53,489
Oh.

330
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:55,388
Look, I don't know about
your guy, but my guy...

331
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:56,498
he's gonna get this.

332
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:57,803
He's gonna pull this off.
You know why?

333
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:00,209
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.

334
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,131
Well, my guy beat
the shit out of me

335
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,350
at a bar in KrakÃ³w 17 years ago

336
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:05,693
and he doesn't even remember me.

337
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:06,991
So...

338
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,514
We all have our histories.

339
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,413
Anyway, it's the
fate of the world here.

340
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:11,514
It's the fate of the world!

341
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:13,264
The planet's population
is in their hands.

342
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,443
Serious stuff.

343
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,984
I mean, you'd think they'd
be able to put aside

344
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,850
any petty rivalries
to save the world.

345
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:21,100
- No fuckin' way!
- No fuckin' way!

346
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:23,579
I'm not working with this guy.
I've been there, done that.

347
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,853
The minute he gets involved,

348
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:26,620
you can kiss goodbye
to any finesse

349
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,712
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

350
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,532
Yeah, Mr. Arson here only
knows how to blow shit up.

351
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,907
- And the fact is...
- And the fact is...

352
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,657
- No offense...
- Oh, no offense...

353
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,992
- This guy's a real asshole.
- This guy's a real arsehole.

354
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,883
That's, uh, "sumbitch"
in your native tongue.

355
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,297
That'd be "wanker"
in your native tongue.

356
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,327
You finished blabbering?

357
00:19:44,352 --> 00:19:46,061
You sound like a giant
tattooed baby.

358
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,547
Yeah, well, I'm not
listening to this horseshit.

359
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:48,774
I got a job to do.

360
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:50,961
Tell your mom I said hi.

361
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,219
Actually...

362
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:53,617
I'll tell her myself.

363
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:54,783
Don't you ever
talk about my mother

364
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,172
or I'll put your head
through that wall.

365
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,414
Secondly, I'll have
this job done

366
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,163
while you're still
putting on your baby oil.

367
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:01,313
Good luck, slick.

368
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:02,703
That's it.

369
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,311
You just reminded me.

370
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,352
That exactly why I hate
working with you.

371
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,219
It's your voice.

372
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:12,532
It's your nasally, prepubescent,

373
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,078
Harry Potter voice.

374
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,719
Every time you speak,
just imagine this for a second...

375
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:21,117
It's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

376
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:23,313
And it hurts.

377
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,633
Well, for me,

378
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:26,610
it's not your voice.

379
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:28,367
It's your face.

380
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:30,554
Your big, stupid face.

381
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:33,328
Lookin' at it makes
me feel like God

382
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:36,571
is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes.

383
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,625
And it burns.

384
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:41,789
It really burns.

385
00:20:43,547 --> 00:20:44,766
What you gonna do now?

386
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,186
Throw a bit of furniture?

387
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,649
For your information,
I was gonna take this chair

388
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,492
and turn it sideways and

389
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,133
shove it right down your throat.

390
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:53,484
Of course you are, 'cause
that's your answer to everything.

391
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,383
Smash a hole
through every problem

392
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:56,547
in a massive truck.

393
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,656
Well, that's not gonna work here.

394
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,704
Ah, I think it'll work fine.

395
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:00,578
Guys! Why don't you
two take a seat,

396
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:02,086
and we'll talk through this?

397
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,048
Me and you, us.

398
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:08,400
I've been down this road.

399
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:09,705
It's a total waste of time.

400
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:11,392
For once, I couldn't
agree with you more.

401
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,231
Yeah? Well, I'm
doin' this my way.

402
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,465
If anyone's got a
problem with that,

403
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,520
I suggest you come
right here and stop me.

404
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:18,715
I'm not going in there.

405
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,458
I'm not going in there.

406
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,036
Smart lads.

407
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:32,655
All right!

408
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,757
Ha! We got rid of
that fun sponge.

409
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,038
We can get to work.

410
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,764
I want you to pull up every CCTV
camera around central London.

411
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,561
Uh, we already have two
dozen agents scouring...

412
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:43,124
Don't you talk back
to me, Opie, uh-uh.

413
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,314
I just care about the coverage.

414
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:46,098
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Now, pull it up.

415
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,611
Now, zoom in on
the area of the heist.

416
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,338
Now, invert it.

417
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,111
Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

418
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:00,958
She's smart.

419
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,792
She just killed her entire team
and stole a deadly virus.

420
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,769
She ain't waitin' around
for no picture.

421
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,385
There're a lot of nasty
people looking for you.

422
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:44,346
Are you nasty?

423
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:47,401
Well, that all depends on what
happens in the next 30 seconds.

424
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,331
Promises, promises.

425
00:23:57,963 --> 00:23:59,401
So, here's how
it's gonna go down.

426
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,612
Do this the hard way
or the easy way.

427
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,221
- Are you serious?
- I am.

428
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:04,283
- Really?
- Yes.

429
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:05,308
Mmm.

430
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,628
- Well, it's a tough decision.
- No, it's really not.

431
00:24:07,838 --> 00:24:09,268
You want me to freeze?

432
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,049
Let me see your hands.

433
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,667
Fine.

434
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,643
Then you're not gonna
like what's in em.

435
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,542
I think I made up my mind.

436
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:21,713
You seem like a smart woman.

437
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:22,789
I am.

438
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,430
The hard way.

439
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:39,553
Stop!

440
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:58,907
Hey. No.

441
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,010
Are you taking it easy on me?

442
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:29,081
For the moment.

443
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:57,240
Bet you wish you didn't
take it easy on me now.

444
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,810
I wish a lot of things right now.

445
00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:09,787
You oughta go to sleep now.

446
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,319
It's all gonna seem
like a bad dream.

447
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:13,944
It's more like a nightmare.

448
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,989
The whole thing is a nightmare.

449
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:20,997
All right, let's me and you
have a little chat.

450
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:46,153
The Director called.

451
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:47,903
He ordered a new
baseline for you.

452
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,926
He has everything ready
for you in medical.

453
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,942
Perfection is a painful process.

454
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:59,684
We see in ourselves in a
foreseeable perfect world.

455
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:04,809
Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.

456
00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:09,153
Eteon will carve out
all human weakness

457
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,950
and replace it with
mechanical perfection.

458
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:14,491
And you will lead the way.

459
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,444
I'm gonna ask you a question.

460
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,538
It's not what you think it is.

461
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:23,452
Do you like to dance?

462
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:25,092
What, the Electric Slide?

463
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:26,530
The Macarena?

464
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:27,896
No, I don't.

465
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,428
No, no, no.
I was thinkin' about...

466
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:32,317
the Tango where it takes two.

467
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:33,632
Yeah, don't know that one.

468
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:35,460
Must be different generations.

469
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,262
Yeah.

470
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:41,199
Well, either way,
the music's started

471
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:43,027
so let's see what kind of
rhythm you have.

472
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:45,198
Where's the virus?

473
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:47,074
Look, I told you, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

474
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,097
Okay, that hurt.

475
00:27:48,122 --> 00:27:49,911
You just stepped on my toes,
it didn't feel good.

476
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,975
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.

477
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:53,214
Where's the virus?

478
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,239
I didn't ask to dance.

479
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:55,950
Why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

480
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:57,137
No? How do you know that?

481
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:58,476
Where's the staff?

482
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,593
There's two types of CIA agents.

483
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:01,827
Intelligence and espionage.

484
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:03,631
Those guys in there could
barely lift a pencil.

485
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:05,264
That's what intelligence
agents look like.

486
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:07,202
And you look like you
could pick up a building.

487
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:10,116
But espionage is about
blending in, about being subtle.

488
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:14,265
And there is nothing
subtle about you.

489
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,343
That's good.

490
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:20,054
- I'm impressed.
- I didn't kill anybody.

491
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,163
I know you didn't.

492
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,382
And how do you know that, then?

493
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,615
Because you could learn
a lot about somebody

494
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:26,614
when you fight them.

495
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:27,881
And when we fought,

496
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,179
you weren't fighting to kill me.

497
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,976
You were fighting to run away.

498
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,101
But either way, the world thinks

499
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,836
that you're a
murderer and a thief.

500
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:36,915
So you're not going anywhere

501
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:38,001
or getting any goddamn phone call

502
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:39,414
until you give me
some real answers.

503
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:41,133
You have no idea
what is happening here.

504
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,867
- Then tell me, help me understand.
- I can't.

505
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,695
- You're wasting my time.
- You're wasting time!

506
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,165
The virus gets in the
wrong hands, that's it.

507
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,296
It's game over.

508
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,898
Does that mean
it's time for curls?

509
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:03,593
Just like the CIA, always
flexing the wrong muscle.

510
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:05,468
You know, the mind is the
strongest muscle in the body.

511
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:07,734
Maybe you should try
exercising that a little bit more.

512
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:10,156
"There is more
wisdom in your body

513
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,039
than in your deepest
philosophies."

514
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,375
Ooh, let me guess.

515
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:14,609
That Bruce Lee?

516
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:15,976
No.

517
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,195
Nietzsche.

518
00:29:17,383 --> 00:29:18,883
'Cause I'm flexing this...

519
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:20,976
And all of that.

520
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:24,812
Come here.

521
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:27,844
If she moves,
I want you to shoot her.

522
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:29,180
Yeah, he can't shoot me.

523
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,288
Yeah, not allowed.

524
00:29:30,313 --> 00:29:31,201
In the face.

525
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:32,343
You can't, not in the face.
You'd go to prison.

526
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,515
You could shoot her
right in the face.

527
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,209
No, you can't. You'd
go to prison. Sorry.

528
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:37,594
I want you to shoot her
two times right in that face.

529
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,727
- Okay?
- Uh...

530
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:48,469
Hi, Dad.

531
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:50,288
Did you catch the hot spy lady?

532
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:52,578
Come on, it's me.
I catch everybody I hunt.

533
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,250
How long have you
been doing this?

534
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,570
Because you seem... new.

535
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,961
She's actually quite annoying.

536
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:06,342
You know, Dad,

537
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:07,928
sometimes people
annoy each other

538
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:10,523
when they're actually, like,
flirting.

539
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:11,805
Where'd you hear that from?

540
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,490
Okay, look, uh...

541
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,445
Me and the spy lady,
we're not flirting, all right?

542
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:19,617
Zero chemistry.

543
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,407
I don't know.

544
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:36,565
When you saw her photo,

545
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,306
you definitely gave the eyebrow.

546
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:39,407
What eyebrow?

547
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:41,531
You know, Dad,
that thing that you do.

548
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:42,649
What thing?

549
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:45,001
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.

550
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,171
No, I don't...
I definitely don't do that.

551
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:48,430
I don't even know
what you're doing.

552
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:50,054
That's the silliest
thing I've ever seen.

553
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:51,986
Let me get going.
I got business to take care of.

554
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,798
I'll see you when
I get home, okay?

555
00:30:53,946 --> 00:30:55,563
- I love you.
- I love you.

556
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:56,946
Hey, one more thing.

557
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:03,024
Goddammit!

558
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,850
It's not the dance
you wanna do with me.

559
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:13,985
Oh, really?

560
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,260
I eat bullets all day long.

561
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,520
Oh, for breakfast or lunch?

562
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,856
'Cause it's dinner time.

563
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,446
I'll count down for you, three...
Two...

564
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:21,471
Hobbs!

565
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:22,492
Freeze!

566
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:23,517
Put that down.

567
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,580
Get your greasy sausage
fingers off of her.

568
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:26,674
What are you doing here?

569
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:27,760
Saving you.

570
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,488
Who said I need to be saved?

571
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,504
No, no, no, no.

572
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:31,590
This is my house...

573
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:32,730
and your goddamn girlfriend
ain't going anywhere.

574
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:33,721
That's disgusting.

575
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:34,746
Girlfriend?

576
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,543
That is my sister.

577
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:41,362
Bullshit. She's too good looking
to be your sister.

578
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:42,558
Very funny. Hattie.

579
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,777
There are people after you.

580
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:44,785
Believe me, I know that.

581
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,753
Yeah, it's gonna stay that way

582
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,144
unless you tell me
where that virus is.

583
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:48,230
Listen to me, pinhead.

584
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:50,442
She's gonna die if I don't get
her out of here right now!

585
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:52,612
We're all gonna die if she doesn't
tell us where that weapon is.

586
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:53,832
Actually, everyone's gonna die

587
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,472
because I am the virus!

588
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,363
It's embedded in capsules.

589
00:31:57,854 --> 00:31:59,294
I need to find a way
to get them out.

590
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,546
Bag the asset.

591
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:58,059
Now or never.

592
00:32:58,114 --> 00:32:59,551
I'm more of a now type of guy.

593
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:00,645
On my three.

594
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:02,034
Sure.

595
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:04,457
One, two, three!

596
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,582
No one tells me what to do.

597
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:31,427
Now, I take you to school, son.

598
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:50,053
Deckard Shaw.

599
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,318
It's been a long time.

600
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:52,864
Good to see you, Brixton.

601
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,302
I think you're out of
bullets there, son.

602
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,693
Lucky for you, I am.

603
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:56,951
Yeah.

604
00:34:58,467 --> 00:34:59,959
- Nice suit.
- Bulletproof.

605
00:35:00,342 --> 00:35:01,584
State of the art.

606
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:03,232
Shoulda put that on the last
time I put a bullet in you.

607
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:04,521
Actually, it was three bullets.

608
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:07,092
Two to the chest, one to the
head, just like they taught us.

609
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,271
Remember?

610
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:10,139
It's a shame you
didn't join Eteon.

611
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:11,685
You could've had
all this, my friend.

612
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:12,746
- Friend?
- Yeah.

613
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,927
You're not the man I know.

614
00:35:13,952 --> 00:35:14,952
No.

615
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,787
I am way better.

616
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,054
I'm the future of mankind.

617
00:35:45,823 --> 00:35:46,839
Stop!

618
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:48,534
Stop!

619
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:51,542
Hattie!

620
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:52,667
Get in the car.

621
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:53,932
We're all going.

622
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:55,737
Not you.

623
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:57,346
Just the girl.

624
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,026
I said...

625
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,503
We're all going.

626
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,165
Stay with the car.

627
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,307
I need the girl alive.

628
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:34,767
What the hell
did you do, Hattie?

629
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,595
Oh, big brother lecture
now, really, huh?

630
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:39,179
I injected myself. I didn't have
a choice. He was gonna take it.

631
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:53,081
Programming set in vector.

632
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,124
You might wanna...

633
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,019
Might be time for some curls.

634
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:27,700
Very good.

635
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:31,870
You mind telling me just

636
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:33,887
what the fresh turkey hell
we're dealing with here?

637
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,038
Long story.

638
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:37,327
He's a ghost.
Supposed to be dead.

639
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:39,889
Eight years ago, I put a bullet
through his brain.

640
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:41,100
Great.

641
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,827
So, we're being chased
by the Terminator.

642
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,294
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

643
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:49,801
Well, I don't think he can see
over the steering wheel.

644
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,989
Buckle up, fat boy, I'm
gonna save your life again.

645
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,784
You want a war then.

646
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,143
Okay.

647
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:09,375
Okay, ride's over.

648
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:10,766
Gotta lose this car.

649
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:19,203
Update.

650
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:23,140
I've hacked the mainframe of
every news agency and outlet.

651
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:24,328
How many do we control?

652
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,617
174 broadcasts, 2,000 ought...

653
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:29,092
Double it. I want
100% control of this story.

654
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:30,099
Standard frame job?

655
00:40:30,124 --> 00:40:31,126
No. Standard will not do.

656
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:32,805
I need something
special for these guys.

657
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,406
Listen up. Narrative:

658
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:39,069
Hobbs, Shaw. Big guy,
little guy have been ID'd.

659
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,810
They've been blamed for the
recent attacks on the CIA.

660
00:40:42,996 --> 00:40:46,152
They shared a prison cell
where they hatched a plan

661
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,623
to start their reign of terror.

662
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:51,029
It just got real.

663
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:54,865
Who the hell are these guys?

664
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:55,996
Eteon.

665
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,412
A most secret tech cult.

666
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,036
With a mercenary army
and plenty of dark money.

667
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,513
And delusions of
saving the world

668
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:04,256
by augmenting the human race.

669
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:05,584
That's it.

670
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,490
Apparently, they control
he media as well.

671
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,529
I've heard rumors
about these people.

672
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:11,646
Everybody thinks they're a myth.

673
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:14,256
Assuming first hand
how real they are.

674
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,154
If we don't fit to their plans...

675
00:41:16,326 --> 00:41:17,662
we already dug our own grave.

676
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:19,638
All right, let's get to the
nearest lockdown facility.

677
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:21,185
No, no, no.
You don't get it, do you?

678
00:41:21,264 --> 00:41:22,756
Brixton's a tier one assassin.

679
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:24,035
Best I've ever seen.

680
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,099
I know him. He ain't
never gonna stop.

681
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,332
Till he gets that virus.

682
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:29,099
And besides, that's my sister.

683
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,389
Family business.

684
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:32,262
Is your name Shaw? No.

685
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:33,419
Then she's going
nowhere with you.

686
00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:34,717
When it comes to
the fate of the world,

687
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:35,834
it becomes my business.

688
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:37,029
I don't care if she's your sister.

689
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:38,380
That woman ain't
going anywhere...

690
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:39,435
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

691
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:41,542
Where? I don't have time for
alpha male shit right now.

692
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,457
You're both idiots.
You clearly can't work together.

693
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:45,001
And so you're absolutely
useless to me.

694
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:46,448
So, I'm gonna go find the man

695
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:48,072
who can help me get this
thing out of my system.

696
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:49,056
See you.

697
00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:50,237
You mean this man?

698
00:41:52,691 --> 00:41:54,261
I was tracking him
before the attack.

699
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,463
He's hard to find but I think
I got a hell of a lead.

700
00:41:56,502 --> 00:41:57,713
Russian newspaper.

701
00:41:57,792 --> 00:41:59,206
Not just any old paper.

702
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,511
There's only one place in
London that sells that.

703
00:42:03,403 --> 00:42:04,810
Here you go. See you tomorrow.

704
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:08,183
That's optimistic.

705
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:18,592
Morning, Director.

706
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,132
Well, well.

707
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:26,842
Deckard Shaw.

708
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:28,905
How complicated for you.

709
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:30,686
Not really.

710
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:34,452
He's also working with
DSS, Luke Hobbs.

711
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:35,764
Hobbs.

712
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:37,444
We have a history.

713
00:42:37,897 --> 00:42:39,264
They're formidable.

714
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:40,692
Small fry.

715
00:42:40,762 --> 00:42:42,331
I'll eliminate the two of them.

716
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:43,949
Get the asset back ASAP.

717
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,918
You get the girl,
extract the virus

718
00:42:47,012 --> 00:42:49,426
and reprogram it for Phase One.

719
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:52,207
We use that weapon
to eliminate the weak

720
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,363
and anyone who'll
get in our way.

721
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:57,418
We're building a perfect
system, Brixton.

722
00:42:57,481 --> 00:43:00,606
Hobbs and Shaw would be
considerable assets for Eteon.

723
00:43:00,824 --> 00:43:02,082
Turn them.

724
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:03,426
Turn 'em?

725
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:05,301
Sorry, I don't follow.

726
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:07,613
I want them turned.

727
00:43:07,676 --> 00:43:09,667
I want them working
for the cause.

728
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:10,879
Understood?

729
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:12,707
They can't be turned.

730
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:15,184
What makes you so certain?

731
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:17,611
The last time we asked,
I got shot in the face.

732
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,965
That makes me very certain.

733
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:23,020
So, I suggest that we take
another approach.

734
00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:25,762
- Which is why...
- I did not ask you, Brixton.

735
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:27,793
You show them the
consequences of refusal.

736
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:30,809
Or perhaps...
I'll show them to you.

737
00:43:30,934 --> 00:43:32,145
Is that a threat?

738
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:36,160
I'd remember who you're
relying on for your survival.

739
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:39,127
All for the cause.

740
00:43:43,993 --> 00:43:45,282
Look, honey, I have to
talk to you about something.

741
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:46,570
It's very important right now.

742
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:47,712
Remember how we spoke about

743
00:43:47,737 --> 00:43:49,509
what would happen if
things went sideways?

744
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:50,852
We called it a code red?

745
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:52,673
Well, it's happening.

746
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:54,306
I-Is there anything I can do?

747
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,539
You need to stay home.

748
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:56,750
You're gonna be safe there.

749
00:43:56,775 --> 00:43:57,766
As a matter of fact, we've got

750
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:00,516
the CIA listening in
on this call right now.

751
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:02,774
Watch this. Hi, Locke.

752
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,017
Everybody's safe,
everybody's great.

753
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,337
I'm actually at our old, uh,

754
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:06,516
our old diner here.

755
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,758
It's super weird being
here without you guys.

756
00:44:10,758 --> 00:44:11,969
I think it's closed.

757
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,438
Thank you, brother.

758
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:16,619
Honey, I've already
talked to Aunt Lisa.

759
00:44:16,643 --> 00:44:17,930
She knows exactly what to do.

760
00:44:17,977 --> 00:44:19,758
I'm gonna be home
as soon as I can.

761
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:21,657
Love you.

762
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:23,071
I love you back.

763
00:44:24,297 --> 00:44:25,297
Bye.

764
00:44:27,813 --> 00:44:29,954
Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw.

765
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:33,097
While Hobbs is an agent
of the American...

766
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,313
Tell us everything you know...
about this.

767
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:38,133
My God. When...

768
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,131
When were you exposed?

769
00:44:40,156 --> 00:44:41,328
About 30 hours ago.

770
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:43,648
Then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact.

771
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:44,981
So we need to neutralize it.

772
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:46,295
No, it is not that easy.

773
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:48,374
It's not programmed
to any DNA sequence.

774
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:50,076
It's fatal to everyone.

775
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:53,204
In 42 hours, the capsules will
dissolve and she'll be infected.

776
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:55,259
Then the virus will go airborne.

777
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:58,728
We are talking global
contamination within a week.

778
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,485
Why in the hell would you
create something like that?

779
00:45:00,509 --> 00:45:01,923
Because I thought
I was one of them.

780
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:03,031
Eteon.

781
00:45:03,056 --> 00:45:05,462
They told me they wanted to
save the world through science.

782
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:06,962
I believed in their cause.

783
00:45:06,987 --> 00:45:10,282
I developed the Snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines...

784
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,040
a panacea for the whole world...

785
00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:15,665
but they redeveloped it into a
programmable apocalypse

786
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:17,396
to attack the weakest of us.

787
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:20,249
Those not worthy of Eteon's
vision of the future.

788
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:22,327
For a scientist,
you seem incredibly stupid.

789
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,163
Well, I'm a two-times
Nobel Prize winner

790
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,622
but who's counting?

791
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,752
Right, you said the
virus was programmable.

792
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:29,766
So, reprogram it.

793
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,704
I can't reprogram it in a host.

794
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:33,275
Just tell us how to get
this thing out from me.

795
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:35,002
Well, there are two options.

796
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,729
And the first is easy.

797
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:37,494
Go.

798
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:38,283
Finally.

799
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:39,033
You kill her.

800
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:39,830
Excuse me?

801
00:45:39,855 --> 00:45:40,862
Oh, and burn the
body, of course.

802
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:41,533
Of course.

803
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:42,486
Of course.

804
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:43,596
No, I mean, really burn it.

805
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:44,330
Really burn it?

806
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:44,893
To ash.

807
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:45,665
To ash?

808
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,705
Beyond all recognition.

809
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,306
Let's assume that's not an
option, shall we, genius?

810
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:50,994
Yeah, doesn't work for us.
Option number two?

811
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:53,822
There is a machine that can preserve
her life and extract the virus.

812
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:55,330
Well, that should've been
option number one.

813
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:57,041
Because it's
impossible to get to.

814
00:45:57,096 --> 00:45:58,463
We'll decide what's impossible.

815
00:45:58,681 --> 00:45:59,681
Where is it?

816
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:02,705
It's in the Eteon laboratory
where the Snowflake was developed.

817
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,182
A secret dark tech complex

818
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:05,345
fortified by an army

819
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,932
in the most God-forsaken
part of the planet.

820
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,251
But if you go there,
all three of you will die.

821
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:11,893
So, basically what
you're saying is

822
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:13,315
she dies no matter what.

823
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,424
Well, who needs a drink?

824
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:19,752
I know just the place.

825
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:39,510
Wow, look at all these.

826
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:42,823
Somebody's overcompensating.

827
00:46:43,284 --> 00:46:45,315
If anything,
I'm undercompensating.

828
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:48,850
And a teeny tiny one.

829
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,125
Just your size.

830
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:53,867
Used it for a job over in Italy.

831
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,227
Shame we didn't need a
weightlifting bus driver.

832
00:46:57,703 --> 00:46:59,008
Woulda given you a call.

833
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,391
Drink?

834
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,702
Yeah, I'll take a little one.

835
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:30,650
All right, there's someone in
Moscow, an old friend.

836
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:32,291
We have a long history.

837
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:34,634
She and her crew are paying
a visit to some locals.

838
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:36,509
Particular Russian criminal element.

839
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:38,189
They got things
that we're gonna need.

840
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:39,510
Considering your
history of friends,

841
00:47:39,534 --> 00:47:40,948
how many bullets you
put in this one's head?

842
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:42,081
Hey, they can
set us up with gear

843
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:43,364
and I don't hear
any other ideas.

844
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:44,433
You know as well as I do

845
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,536
getting out of this country's
gonna be extremely difficult.

846
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,333
We have every major
intelligence agency

847
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:49,662
already hunting us down.

848
00:47:49,738 --> 00:47:51,450
And there's the fact
that you disgraced MI6

849
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,097
when you betrayed your team.

850
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,841
Don't believe
everything they tell ya.

851
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:04,630
Smile.

852
00:48:09,862 --> 00:48:11,807
You know, regular back channels
aren't gonna work this time.

853
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:13,463
We're gonna have to
do our best to blend in.

854
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:14,847
Hide in plain sight.

855
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,479
That's why we'll be
flying commercial.

856
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,635
Commercial, we're gonna
get spotted too easy at...

857
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:22,112
Don't wear out that pea-sized
brain, I handled it.

858
00:48:22,212 --> 00:48:24,407
Cloned our cellphone
signals around the world.

859
00:48:24,432 --> 00:48:26,089
Should buy us at least 48 hours.

860
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:28,058
We'll pick up new gear
when we get to Moscow.

861
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:30,278
Should get us past the
wandering eyes at the airport.

862
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:33,120
This is probably the only
thing that's gonna fit.

863
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:35,813
Fit what, a Smurf?

864
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,454
I think that's one of my old ones.

865
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,852
I apologize in advance

866
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:40,555
if it's a little loose
around the balls.

867
00:48:41,576 --> 00:48:42,530
Okay.

868
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:44,319
What do we got, tough guy?
Come on.

869
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:45,766
I created new identities

870
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:47,720
and altered your
biometric profiles

871
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:49,245
so the airport scanners
don't recognize

872
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:50,509
you faces or your fingerprints.

873
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:51,678
You're Sarah Atkins.

874
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,275
You work in insurance.

875
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:54,626
Hello.

876
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,267
Thank you.

877
00:48:58,447 --> 00:48:59,447
Thanks.

878
00:48:59,509 --> 00:49:00,798
I'm Franz Gruber.

879
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:02,876
A freelance architect.

880
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,767
Avid mountain climber.

881
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:06,689
And a part-time ski instructor.

882
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:10,337
Thank you.

883
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:11,564
And you.

884
00:49:12,064 --> 00:49:13,517
You're Michael Oxmaul.

885
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:17,517
Mike Oxmaul?

886
00:49:22,303 --> 00:49:23,475
I go by Michael.

887
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:26,802
- Freeze!
- Stop, sir!

888
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:28,271
Stand down!

889
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:29,858
It's Mike! It's Mike Oxmaul!

890
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:32,311
It's not... small...
and my name's Michael.

891
00:49:32,342 --> 00:49:34,420
They stopped him
for what, exactly?

892
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:36,708
Whatever it is,
it's gonna involve rubber gloves

893
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,264
and a body cavity search.

894
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,091
Let's go.

895
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,099
Hands on your head, Oxmaul.

896
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:53,632
Can't believe you did that.

897
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:55,491
He was gonna slow us down.

898
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,546
We can't pull this off.
We both know it.

899
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:02,807
Bad enough I've got
this thing in my blood

900
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:04,462
that's gonna kill me
and everyone else.

901
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:05,742
But were you seriously
gonna break this

902
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:07,514
mysterious machine out of some

903
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,359
high-security
death virus complex

904
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:10,906
and magically get it to work?

905
00:50:11,014 --> 00:50:12,177
Frankly, that sounds
completely...

906
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:13,623
You still wear that silly thing?

907
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,100
Don't know you still had that.

908
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:19,709
Put the pin back in.

909
00:50:20,873 --> 00:50:21,983
You haven't changed.

910
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:27,608
Wish I could say
the same about you.

911
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,725
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

912
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:32,092
We're gonna make this work.

913
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:33,561
It's what we do.

914
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,967
And what if we don't?

915
00:50:38,022 --> 00:50:39,724
What if the only option
left is for you to...

916
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:40,974
That's not happening.

917
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,528
Hi! I'm here.

918
00:50:43,872 --> 00:50:45,122
I'm Michael.

919
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,472
Hi. Yeah.

920
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:51,894
Hello.

921
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,082
All right.

922
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:56,402
Oh! Yeah.

923
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,230
Let's see, where's my seat?

924
00:50:58,551 --> 00:50:59,637
F1...

925
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,379
F2...

926
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,668
FU.

927
00:51:11,097 --> 00:51:13,206
You are an asshole.

928
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,800
You're quicker than I thought.

929
00:51:14,824 --> 00:51:16,754
Yup, because I have
a secret weapon.

930
00:51:16,816 --> 00:51:18,238
People actually like me.

931
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:19,886
You wouldn't understand that

932
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,433
because you don't
have any friends.

933
00:51:26,676 --> 00:51:28,137
I love your babushka.

934
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:05,628
Couldn't have booked
an emergency row

935
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:07,042
for a little bit more
legroom, huh?

936
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:09,729
Not everybody has
hobbit legs like you.

937
00:52:09,784 --> 00:52:10,784
Hey, look.

938
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:12,221
In case you didn't realize,

939
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:14,346
I could give a damn
about your comfort.

940
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:16,354
So, why don't you
be a good elephant?

941
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,526
Suck up another kilo of peanuts.

942
00:52:18,596 --> 00:52:20,369
Put your chair back and relax.

943
00:52:20,711 --> 00:52:22,383
All right, listen, don't ever
tell me to relax, all right?

944
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:23,422
Don't tell me to do anything.

945
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:24,975
Any time you ever say anything,

946
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,200
it makes me wanna take my boot

947
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,545
and shove it so far up your ass,

948
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,202
you're gonna be spitting
out shoelaces all week.

949
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:31,374
Hey, you know
what the problem is?

950
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:34,319
I'll tell you the problem.
This job...

951
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:36,108
This job requires stealth.

952
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:38,132
And you...

953
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:39,796
Look at you.

954
00:52:39,913 --> 00:52:42,468
I mean, granted,
it's not your fault.

955
00:52:42,632 --> 00:52:43,874
But you're too obvious.

956
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:45,515
You stick out.

957
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,093
Like balls on a bulldog.

958
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:51,128
Dangling down in all
the wrong places.

959
00:52:51,394 --> 00:52:53,144
Seemingly harmless.

960
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:56,152
And the next thing you know,

961
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,058
they're trying to
impregnate your sister.

962
00:52:58,128 --> 00:52:59,714
Ho! What?

963
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:02,081
Impregnate your sister?

964
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:03,191
You heard.

965
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:05,503
Oh...

966
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:08,417
Now, I get it.

967
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:10,922
You do? Good.
I'm glad.

968
00:53:10,942 --> 00:53:12,051
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I'm glad.

969
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:13,081
I'm very glad.

970
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,449
So, you actually think that
I'm going through all this effort,

971
00:53:15,473 --> 00:53:17,668
on this mission,
trying to save the world,

972
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:19,575
by the way, for a fourth time,

973
00:53:19,638 --> 00:53:21,106
because I'm really good at it.

974
00:53:21,224 --> 00:53:22,654
You think I'm
going through all of this

975
00:53:22,678 --> 00:53:24,747
just so I can do
the horizontal hula,

976
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:26,403
sexy-sexy time with your sister?

977
00:53:26,528 --> 00:53:27,591
Not all.

978
00:53:28,052 --> 00:53:29,052
Most.

979
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:30,361
Let me break it down
for you, Frodo:

980
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:32,282
This ain't 1955 anymore.

981
00:53:32,454 --> 00:53:33,875
All right, despite the fact that

982
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,039
that girl sleeping right
there is related to you,

983
00:53:36,064 --> 00:53:39,054
she's still one of the toughest,
baddest, most capable women

984
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,275
I've ever encountered
in my entire life.

985
00:53:41,396 --> 00:53:44,537
And if she chooses
to look the way

986
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:47,264
of this big, brown,

987
00:53:47,514 --> 00:53:52,326
well-endowed, tattooed,
mountain of a man,

988
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,936
then guess what...

989
00:53:54,162 --> 00:53:56,365
I'm gonna let her
climb this mountain

990
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:59,521
over and over and over

991
00:54:00,232 --> 00:54:01,193
again.

992
00:54:01,248 --> 00:54:02,748
Stay away from her.

993
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,111
I see what you're doin'.

994
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:07,860
- What, do you think I'm stupid?
- Of course, I think you're stupid.

995
00:54:07,884 --> 00:54:09,118
But you know what,
I'll do you a favor.

996
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:10,595
I'll knock that dumb
right out of your skull.

997
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:11,666
You just say the word, Jack.

998
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,704
You know what I wanna do?

999
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:15,681
I wanna do an Irish jig
on your arse ugly face

1000
00:54:15,706 --> 00:54:17,392
at 30,000 feet.

1001
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,945
- Oh, 30,000 feet.
- Yeah.

1002
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:20,448
- So you wanna dance right now.
- Yeah.

1003
00:54:20,472 --> 00:54:22,775
The only thing holding you
back is air and opportunity.

1004
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:25,031
There goes the air.

1005
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:27,157
Bring it on, bunghole.

1006
00:54:27,212 --> 00:54:28,642
That's enough, hey. Cut it out.

1007
00:54:28,892 --> 00:54:30,361
Both y'all, cut it out.

1008
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:32,301
Oh, see. You woke up
the air marshal.

1009
00:54:32,326 --> 00:54:33,661
You woke the air marshal.

1010
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:34,928
How did you know
I was a air marshal?

1011
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:35,889
Unaccompanied.

1012
00:54:35,914 --> 00:54:37,928
Late boarded the
plane Aisle seat.

1013
00:54:37,998 --> 00:54:39,193
Golf shirt.

1014
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:43,450
Well, let's just call that
a educated guess.

1015
00:54:43,966 --> 00:54:46,169
Air Marshal Dinkley
at your service.

1016
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:48,154
I'm sorry, did you say,
Dink lick?

1017
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:49,303
What's the problem?

1018
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:50,912
Dinkley.

1019
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,318
Understand this, big fella.

1020
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:54,170
Because it's my job to observe.

1021
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:55,884
Thick neck, your head's
been on a swivel

1022
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:57,349
since you've been on
this damn plane.

1023
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,931
Every passenger
that's got on here

1024
00:54:58,956 --> 00:55:00,276
you've been checkin' out.

1025
00:55:00,322 --> 00:55:01,555
You a lawman.

1026
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:03,260
And you, Mister-Almighty-Pants.

1027
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:04,682
You a spy.

1028
00:55:05,346 --> 00:55:06,993
- That's pretty good.
- Eh, not bad.

1029
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:08,612
I get it, we're all big guys.

1030
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,338
The three of us. Alphas.

1031
00:55:10,752 --> 00:55:13,321
Three apex predators
cooped up in the sky.

1032
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:14,721
Tensions get high.

1033
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:17,299
What you throwin' up on the
bench, big fella, 300, 400 pounds?

1034
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:18,805
A little less.

1035
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,088
Yeah, light work.

1036
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:21,612
I'm doin' the same thing.

1037
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:22,987
Slaggin' weight.

1038
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:24,385
Clangin' and bangin'.

1039
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:25,829
What you into?

1040
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:26,869
Hot yoga?

1041
00:55:26,894 --> 00:55:27,909
Pilates?

1042
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:29,630
Probably messin' 'round
in a hot takai.

1043
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:31,083
Hey, you wanna know what I do?

1044
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,115
I sit in a can or farts
all day long.

1045
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,677
That's what I'm dealin' with.

1046
00:55:35,943 --> 00:55:38,615
It's an occasional terrorist
and a lotta recycled ass.

1047
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,013
I would give anything
to be on the front line again.

1048
00:55:41,482 --> 00:55:42,505
Again?

1049
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:44,113
What?

1050
00:55:44,138 --> 00:55:45,826
I was a compartment
element for JSOC.

1051
00:55:45,857 --> 00:55:46,943
You're a Delta?

1052
00:55:46,997 --> 00:55:49,099
Sabre Squad Echo, 24-7, baby.

1053
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:50,731
Echo, those guys
were the warlocks

1054
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:51,896
because of the
magic they could do.

1055
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,888
That's right.

1056
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:55,380
Well, if that's the case,
I'ma say abracadabra, bitches.

1057
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:57,037
You're lookin' at the magic.

1058
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:58,755
You know what your problem is?

1059
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:00,294
Your balance is off.

1060
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:01,785
You need a third squaddie.

1061
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,794
- No, no, no.
- No.

1062
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:04,240
Guys, I know the game.

1063
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:05,693
Ya hear me?

1064
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:07,396
I know the game.

1065
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,638
What are you doin'?

1066
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:09,943
What do you mean
what am I doin'?

1067
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:10,990
Don't talk like that.

1068
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:12,232
You sound different.

1069
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,199
Do what?

1070
00:56:13,224 --> 00:56:14,301
That's not your voice.

1071
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,388
Use your regular voice.

1072
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:17,868
This is my regular voice.

1073
00:56:17,985 --> 00:56:20,266
I'm talkin' like
the warlocks talk, baby.

1074
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:21,601
They don't talk like that.

1075
00:56:21,626 --> 00:56:23,524
I'm just showin' you,
that's all, guys. Look.

1076
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:25,649
All I'm sayin' is I can complete

1077
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:27,671
this holy trinity
that you guys have.

1078
00:56:27,696 --> 00:56:28,946
Three would be too much.

1079
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,048
That's my resume,
this is my card.

1080
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:32,304
If you need stuff,

1081
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,169
I'm the guy that you call
to get what you need.

1082
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,642
You want a Citation X?
You want a G5?

1083
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:38,196
You want a Boeing 747?
You want a helicopter?

1084
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,985
You want somethin' stealth?

1085
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:42,618
I'm a air marshal. I'm your guy.

1086
00:56:49,259 --> 00:56:50,275
Please.

1087
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:51,845
Please, let me go.

1088
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,923
What do you want?!

1089
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:01,265
I want our property
out of that girl's blood.

1090
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:03,265
No! The virus is...
It's too dangerous.

1091
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,329
I-I can't!

1092
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:16,577
Humans must evolve, Professor.

1093
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:18,352
Without each of those upgrades,

1094
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,959
the human body's really not...

1095
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:21,671
worth that much.

1096
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:24,147
Maybe 11 pence worth
of magnesium.

1097
00:57:24,172 --> 00:57:25,827
A coupla pence worth of calcium.

1098
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:27,616
And a bit of iron.

1099
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:30,093
Not worth much.

1100
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,968
I'd say, all in all,
probably about...

1101
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:37,147
Three pound...
Three pound fifty... Max.

1102
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,772
The entirety of a man's worth.

1103
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:41,741
Small change.

1104
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:45,804
You're gonna reprogram
that virus for me.

1105
00:57:46,116 --> 00:57:47,522
I wo-I won't.

1106
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:14,955
Ah, your friend's
a Russian mobster.

1107
00:58:15,955 --> 00:58:17,830
This girl steals from
Russian mobsters.

1108
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:20,174
Actually,
she steals from everyone.

1109
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:21,901
It's kind of her thing.

1110
00:58:31,728 --> 00:58:33,009
Deckard Shaw.

1111
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:35,650
Margarita.

1112
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,138
Deckard Shaw.

1113
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:40,778
Margarita.

1114
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:56,502
Oh, I did not see that comin'.

1115
00:58:56,955 --> 00:58:58,533
I wish I didn't see that at all.

1116
00:58:59,596 --> 00:59:00,650
Me, too.

1117
00:59:01,674 --> 00:59:03,002
I got your list.

1118
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:05,494
It's... long.

1119
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:07,619
I asked for a house
with a runway.

1120
00:59:07,908 --> 00:59:10,713
Not sure a dozen Russians
in duct tape were on the list.

1121
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:12,807
Well, give me more than
three-hour notice...

1122
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,455
and I wouldn't have to
resort to such extremes.

1123
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:16,820
I'm sure three hours

1124
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:19,446
has anything to do with your
extremes, Margarita.

1125
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:22,211
Keep me out of it, Deckard.

1126
00:59:22,773 --> 00:59:23,976
Eteon?

1127
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,204
Could you pick a harder
place to break into?

1128
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:29,142
We need to find the CT17
viral extraction machine.

1129
00:59:29,244 --> 00:59:30,305
Could be anywhere.

1130
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,455
That facility's three square
miles of research labs.

1131
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:33,523
Yeah.

1132
00:59:33,548 --> 00:59:35,806
And it's a powder keg
packed with munitions.

1133
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:37,423
We've got to pull a Mick Jagger.

1134
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:39,939
This sounds like a fun game.

1135
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:41,880
We're not gettin' you
on the inside, no.

1136
00:59:41,905 --> 00:59:42,911
So, when Deck and I were kids,

1137
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:44,934
we used to spend our time
comin' up with these grifts.

1138
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,144
A Mick Jagger...

1139
00:59:46,176 --> 00:59:48,379
was a job that required
one person to showboat...

1140
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:49,779
throw the all arms...

1141
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,950
while the others made the music.

1142
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:53,893
A typical inside job.

1143
00:59:56,974 --> 00:59:58,443
Guys, you heard Andreiko.

1144
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:00,037
They have to use
the extraction machine.

1145
01:00:00,092 --> 01:00:01,865
So they'll take me right to it.

1146
01:00:02,326 --> 01:00:03,756
Now, I can do it.

1147
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:06,256
We can do it.

1148
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,263
So now, the only question is

1149
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:10,060
how to ring Eteon's dinner bell.

1150
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,248
Oh, I can handle that part.

1151
01:00:12,334 --> 01:00:14,224
But first,
let's get you geared up.

1152
01:00:16,524 --> 01:00:18,353
These are your HALO parachutes.

1153
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:23,110
Earbuds for encrypted
communication.

1154
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:25,985
Scorpion EVO 3
with optical sights.

1155
01:00:27,438 --> 01:00:29,837
Ultra-thin
bullet-resistant Kevlar.

1156
01:00:31,016 --> 01:00:33,337
Infrared cameras for
seeing through walls.

1157
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,048
And last but not least...

1158
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,188
Compact hydrogen detonator.

1159
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:39,235
Put it in the right spot...

1160
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:41,321
it'll blow the place sky high.

1161
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:43,508
How do I look?

1162
01:00:44,665 --> 01:00:46,024
It's a little tight.

1163
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,454
How you holdin' up?

1164
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,329
You know,
if things go south in there,

1165
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,774
you can't leave me alive.

1166
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:02,274
We're gonna get you outta there.

1167
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:04,743
And let me tell
you somethin' else.

1168
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,414
The key to immortality

1169
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:08,789
is first living a life
worth remembering.

1170
01:01:10,558 --> 01:01:11,831
Is that one Nietzsche?

1171
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:12,877
Nah.

1172
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:14,347
That's Bruce Lee.

1173
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:17,964
Come on.

1174
01:01:26,363 --> 01:01:27,551
How'd you find her?

1175
01:01:28,113 --> 01:01:30,301
You've heard about me.
I'm good at my job.

1176
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,137
Was she alone?

1177
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:34,121
Yeah.

1178
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:38,230
If you're lying to me,
I will cut your heart out.

1179
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:39,675
Do you understand?

1180
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:43,145
I'd be afraid if I had one.

1181
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:15,817
Now, that's a ride.

1182
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:16,942
What a ride.

1183
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:18,442
I got shotgun.

1184
01:02:18,817 --> 01:02:20,081
There ain't no shotgun.

1185
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:21,138
No, no, no. Don't start.

1186
01:02:21,731 --> 01:02:22,825
I got shotgun.

1187
01:02:27,469 --> 01:02:29,407
We're entering the drop zone.

1188
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:30,539
You ready?

1189
01:02:30,766 --> 01:02:32,282
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- On my three.

1190
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,883
- Okay.
- One!

1191
01:02:35,696 --> 01:02:37,414
Die! You arsehole!

1192
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:38,610
Whoo!

1193
01:02:46,569 --> 01:02:48,186
Nobody tells me what to do.

1194
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:06,124
So, I'm intrigued.

1195
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:07,467
Do you wash the
blood off your hands

1196
01:03:07,491 --> 01:03:09,663
before you count your money
or is it afterwards?

1197
01:03:19,993 --> 01:03:20,993
Dismissed.

1198
01:03:22,251 --> 01:03:23,837
You don't get it, do you?

1199
01:03:23,907 --> 01:03:26,095
You know,
the weak deal with money.

1200
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:28,329
We deal with
evolutionary change.

1201
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:30,973
Change that sometimes
require acts of violence.

1202
01:03:30,998 --> 01:03:32,942
Like killing innocent
people with viruses?

1203
01:03:32,973 --> 01:03:34,098
Only the weak ones.

1204
01:03:34,225 --> 01:03:35,990
We're dealing with the
future of the planet.

1205
01:03:36,037 --> 01:03:37,380
Things that money cannot buy.

1206
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:39,717
Oh, like your soul back.

1207
01:03:40,115 --> 01:03:41,240
My soul?

1208
01:03:41,896 --> 01:03:43,365
Your brother took my soul.

1209
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:46,271
The boys in the lab
made me a new one.

1210
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,037
And that's progress.

1211
01:04:05,496 --> 01:04:08,238
Welcome to the
extraction room, Ms. Shaw.

1212
01:04:10,808 --> 01:04:11,871
Get her ready.

1213
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,566
It won't be long.

1214
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,449
I tell you, we ain't
gonna wanna be here

1215
01:04:23,473 --> 01:04:24,581
when this thing goes off.

1216
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,870
Looks like she's
400 yards through there.

1217
01:04:29,205 --> 01:04:30,979
They're holding her in
some sort of medical pod.

1218
01:04:31,003 --> 01:04:32,563
Timer's set for 45 minutes.

1219
01:04:32,588 --> 01:04:33,854
We get in and get out.

1220
01:04:33,879 --> 01:04:35,815
Blow this death factory to pieces.

1221
01:04:35,863 --> 01:04:37,707
Remember, the hallway, no guns.

1222
01:04:37,785 --> 01:04:39,567
Right. Those guys
have to be alive.

1223
01:04:39,628 --> 01:04:40,957
Because at the
end of the hallway,

1224
01:04:40,982 --> 01:04:43,129
the retinal scanner needs
a match to open the door.

1225
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:44,309
Pick a door.

1226
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:45,322
I'm right there.

1227
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:46,488
Nope, that's my door.

1228
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:47,593
What's the matter with you?

1229
01:04:53,284 --> 01:04:54,316
I made a mistake.

1230
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:55,433
This is your door.

1231
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:57,315
Oh, no. No backsies.

1232
01:04:57,558 --> 01:04:59,737
What's the matter? You got a lot
of bad guys behind that door?

1233
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:01,753
Watch this.
You might learn something.

1234
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,562
Thank you. Corresponding match.

1245
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:20,507
Doors opening.

1246
01:07:28,171 --> 01:07:30,530
Very good. Well done, boys.

1247
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,515
I'm impressed that
you even got in here.

1248
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:18,471
Th-That's...

1249
01:08:20,957 --> 01:08:21,972
That's not possible.

1250
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:27,470
What are you doing?

1251
01:08:27,518 --> 01:08:28,758
I'm going to extract it myself.

1252
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:33,416
Wait!

1253
01:08:56,978 --> 01:08:58,212
There he is.

1254
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,118
So rested?

1255
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:01,901
You follow here, Hobbs?

1256
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:03,620
Was gonna order us
some room service.

1257
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:07,509
You fancy french toast?
I'll get the order in.

1258
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,557
I just dreamt they killed you
before I woke up.

1259
01:09:10,721 --> 01:09:12,159
Pretty disappointed right now.

1260
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:15,000
That's real elaborate,
I must admit.

1261
01:09:15,257 --> 01:09:16,983
Old school
interrogation technique

1262
01:09:17,008 --> 01:09:18,928
we picked up in black ops.

1263
01:09:19,006 --> 01:09:20,763
Shock will kill a man in three.

1264
01:09:20,788 --> 01:09:21,868
Do you remember that, Deck?

1265
01:09:22,094 --> 01:09:24,398
Yeah, I remember a lot
of things from back then.

1266
01:09:24,672 --> 01:09:26,812
I reckon you only got
four shocks in you, boys.

1267
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,453
Yeah? I think we can take five.

1268
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:29,836
Five?

1269
01:09:30,015 --> 01:09:31,093
Well, all right!

1270
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,361
You had to open your big mouth.

1271
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:47,307
I thought it was a cool thing
to say at the moment.

1272
01:10:05,339 --> 01:10:07,253
Do you remember when
we were real brothers?

1273
01:10:07,394 --> 01:10:09,550
Task Force Black.
Remember that, Deck?

1274
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:12,292
There we ended up seeing
the worst in people.

1275
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:14,253
Worst in our countries,
our leaders,

1276
01:10:14,278 --> 01:10:16,972
our enemies, our... our friends.

1277
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:18,891
You don't know the meaning
of that word anymore.

1278
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:20,605
Yeah, but don't
worry about it, see...

1279
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:21,886
He shoots 'em right in the head.

1280
01:10:21,911 --> 01:10:24,151
But in your case, I thought
it was a hell of a good idea.

1281
01:10:24,237 --> 01:10:25,629
Big man, you still talkin'?

1282
01:10:25,707 --> 01:10:27,387
I said I thought it was
a hell of a good...

1283
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:37,158
Shit!

1284
01:10:38,315 --> 01:10:40,744
You know, it's funny how
humanity's hate for each other

1285
01:10:40,807 --> 01:10:42,869
is stronger that its
own self preservation.

1286
01:10:42,932 --> 01:10:44,229
Which is why we're here.

1287
01:10:44,393 --> 01:10:46,080
Remember eight years ago, Deck,

1288
01:10:46,151 --> 01:10:47,791
when Eteon asked us
to join their mission?

1289
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:49,643
Oh, you mean their death cult?

1290
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,259
They're lunatics.

1291
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:52,346
Visionaries.

1292
01:10:52,393 --> 01:10:54,088
Visionaries of a future.

1293
01:10:54,113 --> 01:10:56,260
A bigger future,
a brighter future.

1294
01:10:56,307 --> 01:10:58,213
You remember the dates
that they gave us, man?

1295
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:00,502
What, with environmental damage,

1296
01:11:00,533 --> 01:11:02,283
capitalism, terrorism...

1297
01:11:02,557 --> 01:11:05,440
Humanity wipes
itself out by 2096.

1298
01:11:05,502 --> 01:11:06,986
Now, that is scary to me.

1299
01:11:07,104 --> 01:11:09,394
But if we fulfill Eteon's vision,

1300
01:11:09,457 --> 01:11:10,564
we save their world.

1301
01:11:10,589 --> 01:11:12,277
You don't save
the world with genocide.

1302
01:11:12,629 --> 01:11:14,199
Genocide schmenocide.

1303
01:11:14,668 --> 01:11:16,230
You know what this virus is?

1304
01:11:16,925 --> 01:11:19,785
This virus is a necessary
shock to the system!

1305
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,480
That's three.

1306
01:11:36,863 --> 01:11:37,863
I love this thing.

1307
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,120
I told you then...

1308
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:40,846
I'm telling you now.

1309
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,636
Your metrics are off.

1310
01:11:42,988 --> 01:11:44,355
One good reason.

1311
01:11:44,519 --> 01:11:46,050
You assume the worst in people.

1312
01:11:46,191 --> 01:11:48,589
People cannot be trusted
to do the right thing.

1313
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:49,925
Look at the two of you.

1314
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:51,263
The fate of the world
is in your hands

1315
01:11:51,287 --> 01:11:52,630
and you can't even get along.

1316
01:11:53,482 --> 01:11:55,974
But you know all about doing
the right thing, don't you, Shaw?

1317
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,360
A little souvenir here, bro.

1318
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,114
You'd come to kill me.

1319
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:07,869
I'll do the same every time.

1320
01:12:08,743 --> 01:12:10,403
What'd you expect, just yes?

1321
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,903
And who's talking to you?

1322
01:12:15,926 --> 01:12:16,926
Your mom.

1323
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:28,332
I get it, you're still mad.

1324
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,551
You're upset because, hey...

1325
01:12:30,783 --> 01:12:32,064
When you wouldn't turn,

1326
01:12:32,325 --> 01:12:33,698
they asked me
to come and kill you

1327
01:12:33,723 --> 01:12:35,864
and of course, I had to
because you knew too much.

1328
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:38,481
I think about it a lot.

1329
01:12:38,598 --> 01:12:39,786
I think about it.

1330
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,832
Because what I realize now
that I did not realize then

1331
01:12:42,879 --> 01:12:45,911
is that when you shot me,
you gave me a gift.

1332
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:47,167
Look at me.

1333
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:49,043
I'm Black Superman.

1334
01:12:49,645 --> 01:12:50,731
Bulletproof.

1335
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:52,028
New spine.

1336
01:12:52,098 --> 01:12:55,534
And the more machine I become,
the more humane I am.

1337
01:12:55,559 --> 01:12:57,879
This is what you wanna fight for.

1338
01:12:58,254 --> 01:13:01,411
I'm giving you another chance
to join us, Deckard.

1339
01:13:01,495 --> 01:13:03,578
And the boss wants
the big mouth as well.

1340
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:05,180
If not, I kill you both.

1341
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,793
Which honestly, I'd love to do.

1342
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:12,308
You know Eteon, you know
what they're capable of.

1343
01:13:12,629 --> 01:13:14,293
They rebuilt me.

1344
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:15,699
Dismantled him.

1345
01:13:15,754 --> 01:13:17,386
Made it look like
he killed his own team.

1346
01:13:17,418 --> 01:13:19,152
Even your own sister...

1347
01:13:19,769 --> 01:13:21,082
disowned you.

1348
01:13:24,144 --> 01:13:25,347
Just say the word, bro.

1349
01:13:25,379 --> 01:13:27,777
Say the word and
all of this goes away.

1350
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,751
Your sister lives,
his daughter lives.

1351
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,189
We get you some upgrades.

1352
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:34,240
And we go on to
saving the world.

1353
01:13:36,374 --> 01:13:37,428
What's it to be?

1354
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,084
Join the evolution of man

1355
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,405
or die with the weak.

1356
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,053
Just get it done.

1357
01:13:45,576 --> 01:13:47,850
I told the boss you
wouldn't change your mind.

1358
01:13:48,514 --> 01:13:49,654
See ya later.

1359
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:52,092
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1360
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,022
I think we should join.

1361
01:13:56,358 --> 01:13:57,436
Join?

1362
01:13:59,794 --> 01:14:01,654
You said some really
compelling things and...

1363
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:03,303
I mean that
Black Superman thing,

1364
01:14:03,358 --> 01:14:04,897
that really got me. I love that.

1365
01:14:04,936 --> 01:14:06,513
What are you,
deaf, stupid or both?

1366
01:14:06,538 --> 01:14:07,506
We ain't joining.

1367
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:08,872
There you go again, you're
just thinking about yourself.

1368
01:14:08,896 --> 01:14:10,099
You're such a diva.

1369
01:14:10,123 --> 01:14:11,858
What about my feelings for once?

1370
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,913
Let me tell you something,
if we were a band...

1371
01:14:13,937 --> 01:14:15,000
You know who you'd be?

1372
01:14:15,054 --> 01:14:16,406
You'd be Mick Jagger.

1373
01:14:16,695 --> 01:14:17,796
Mick Jagger.

1374
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:20,742
Mick Jagger?

1375
01:14:21,093 --> 01:14:22,750
Oi! What's it to be?

1376
01:14:23,312 --> 01:14:24,851
In or out?

1377
01:14:29,851 --> 01:14:31,397
- We're not gonna join.
- We're not gonna join.

1378
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:33,843
And since you're standin'
there, here's what I'm gonna do.

1379
01:14:34,023 --> 01:14:36,132
I'm gonna rip the arm
off this chair.

1380
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:37,718
I'm gonna smash him
right in the face.

1381
01:14:37,796 --> 01:14:39,687
Stab him right in the neck
for lookin' that way.

1382
01:14:39,796 --> 01:14:41,742
Kill all 13 guys in seven seconds.

1383
01:14:41,914 --> 01:14:43,461
And here's what I'm gonna do.

1384
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:45,601
Slip out of these chains
and drop kick him...

1385
01:14:45,695 --> 01:14:48,375
him and him right in the throat.

1386
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:50,039
No. Not him.

1387
01:14:50,078 --> 01:14:51,758
That's my guy.
You got to pick another guy.

1388
01:14:51,812 --> 01:14:53,445
What do you mean that's
your guy? That's my guy.

1389
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:54,843
No, no, no. That's face smash guy.

1390
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:56,342
You got to find
another drop kick guy.

1391
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,507
You want a face smash guy?

1392
01:14:57,561 --> 01:14:58,741
I'm gonna find you one.

1393
01:14:58,766 --> 01:14:59,843
See that guy over there?

1394
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:01,257
The big one.

1395
01:15:01,632 --> 01:15:02,632
The big one.

1396
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:03,663
That's face smash guy.

1397
01:15:03,695 --> 01:15:04,937
Nah. He's way too big.

1398
01:15:05,077 --> 01:15:06,234
Ain't that right, Hattie?

1399
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:08,749
Let them go.

1400
01:15:08,859 --> 01:15:09,945
All right, boys.

1401
01:15:10,109 --> 01:15:11,195
Stay calm.

1402
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:12,648
We need her alive.

1403
01:15:13,116 --> 01:15:15,030
Let them go or what?

1404
01:15:15,213 --> 01:15:16,876
Or you're gonna
get a nice new bruise

1405
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:18,447
right in the center
of your forehead.

1406
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:19,862
You're not gonna shoot me.

1407
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:23,721
Because you need an activation
chip to fire that gun.

1408
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:25,026
Sorry.

1409
01:15:25,097 --> 01:15:26,565
Try this out!

1410
01:15:31,316 --> 01:15:32,926
I'm not small change.

1411
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:05,840
Let's roll!

1412
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:06,685
You think?

1413
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:07,740
Dick.

1414
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,222
There she is.

1415
01:16:51,988 --> 01:16:53,379
Hattie, where's the machine?

1416
01:16:53,404 --> 01:16:54,551
In the second truck.

1417
01:16:54,613 --> 01:16:55,613
On it!

1418
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:02,248
Mick Jagger.

1419
01:17:02,287 --> 01:17:03,405
Never fails.

1420
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,674
We're not out of this yet, Hattie.

1421
01:17:19,315 --> 01:17:20,447
Got the machine.

1422
01:17:26,552 --> 01:17:27,607
Get a move on!

1423
01:17:27,857 --> 01:17:29,201
Train's leaving the station.

1424
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:51,998
That son of a bitch
really is Black Superman.

1425
01:18:09,373 --> 01:18:10,396
Engage drones.

1426
01:18:24,769 --> 01:18:26,128
We're running out of road!

1427
01:18:27,401 --> 01:18:28,409
Hold on!

1428
01:18:36,577 --> 01:18:37,709
Route to intercept.

1429
01:19:05,404 --> 01:19:06,451
Whoo!

1430
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:15,387
On your left!

1431
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:21,343
Brace yourself.

1432
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:47,084
Hobbs!

1433
01:19:47,467 --> 01:19:48,756
She's not gonna make it!

1434
01:19:49,115 --> 01:19:50,490
Bringin' her to ya!

1435
01:19:50,543 --> 01:19:52,254
You thinkin' what
I'm thinkin', Shaw?

1436
01:19:52,536 --> 01:19:53,872
Let's trade some pain.

1437
01:19:54,317 --> 01:19:55,504
Trade some pain.

1438
01:20:24,383 --> 01:20:25,883
- Hattie!
- Huh?

1439
01:20:25,961 --> 01:20:27,086
You trust me?

1440
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,656
Gonna need a ride!

1441
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:24,320
Ah, I know what you're thinkin'.

1442
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:26,075
Just keep drivin', I'll make it!

1443
01:21:37,568 --> 01:21:38,678
Take the wheel.

1444
01:21:53,237 --> 01:21:54,979
Ah, there he is.

1445
01:21:56,171 --> 01:21:57,291
- I got him.
- No, I got him.

1446
01:21:57,611 --> 01:21:58,851
- I got him.
- I got him.

1447
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,908
I thought you were strong.

1448
01:23:22,172 --> 01:23:23,351
Sorry, brother.

1449
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:25,359
This thing's really damaged.

1450
01:23:25,718 --> 01:23:27,836
Well, there goes option two.

1451
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,437
Now, we use the first one.

1452
01:23:29,484 --> 01:23:30,578
Come on, stop it, Hattie.

1453
01:23:30,664 --> 01:23:32,461
I'm tired, Deck.
I am done running.

1454
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,506
We still got time.

1455
01:23:33,531 --> 01:23:34,531
Time?

1456
01:23:34,672 --> 01:23:36,396
Time for what?
The machine's destroyed.

1457
01:23:36,421 --> 01:23:37,303
Yeah, well, we'll fix it.

1458
01:23:37,328 --> 01:23:38,218
How?

1459
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,601
We need to find a place
to get off the grid.

1460
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,545
Where? We're wanted
all over the world

1461
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:42,672
and Brixton won't stop.

1462
01:23:42,697 --> 01:23:43,985
We can't risk millions of people.

1463
01:23:44,009 --> 01:23:45,382
I told you on the plane,

1464
01:23:45,407 --> 01:23:46,531
we should've gone
with option one.

1465
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:47,820
It is done now, Deck.

1466
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:49,154
- It's not done.
- It's done.

1467
01:23:49,179 --> 01:23:50,265
It's not done!

1468
01:23:52,814 --> 01:23:53,931
It's not done.

1469
01:23:56,822 --> 01:23:57,822
Look at me.

1470
01:23:58,205 --> 01:23:59,471
Remember that thing
you used to say to me

1471
01:23:59,495 --> 01:24:01,275
when we were kids? Huh?

1472
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,985
You used to look at me and say,

1473
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,128
"Deck, it's never over
till it's over."

1474
01:24:05,643 --> 01:24:06,979
We used to laugh.

1475
01:24:07,432 --> 01:24:08,534
Remember that?

1476
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,456
No, Deck, it went...

1477
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:12,783
"It's never over till I say

1478
01:24:13,221 --> 01:24:14,495
it's over."

1479
01:24:14,963 --> 01:24:15,775
Yeah.

1480
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:17,128
That was it.

1481
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,479
So say it now.

1482
01:24:20,767 --> 01:24:21,782
Say it.

1483
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,768
Remember who we are.

1484
01:24:24,682 --> 01:24:25,956
The Shaw family.

1485
01:24:27,448 --> 01:24:30,612
We never...
never, never give up.

1486
01:24:35,057 --> 01:24:36,143
We got a day.

1487
01:24:38,088 --> 01:24:39,299
More than a day.

1488
01:24:40,353 --> 01:24:41,705
We don't even know
where we'd go.

1489
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:45,346
I know a place.

1490
01:24:48,096 --> 01:24:49,096
Where?

1491
01:24:49,432 --> 01:24:51,518
It's the last place on
earth I ever wanna go.

1492
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:55,890
Home.

1493
01:25:16,023 --> 01:25:17,586
Abracacabra, bitches!

1494
01:25:17,633 --> 01:25:19,476
I told you I could
get you anything.

1495
01:25:19,539 --> 01:25:20,656
And listen to me.

1496
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:23,797
From Moscow to Samoa,
that is not an easy flight to charter.

1497
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:24,887
But I got it done!

1498
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:26,108
Well, that's why
we're calling you, Dinkley.

1499
01:25:26,132 --> 01:25:29,052
We just wanna say thank you for
gettin' us that bird to Samoa.

1500
01:25:29,106 --> 01:25:30,398
Warriors help out warriors.

1501
01:25:30,661 --> 01:25:31,966
All you need to know...

1502
01:25:32,052 --> 01:25:34,974
is that you got a third squaddie
over here that is ready to go...

1503
01:25:35,052 --> 01:25:36,614
whenever you need me to.

1504
01:25:36,684 --> 01:25:38,115
I'm just sittin' in my lair.

1505
01:25:40,193 --> 01:25:41,240
You in a bathroom?

1506
01:25:41,271 --> 01:25:42,576
Potato, potahto.

1507
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:44,490
Wherever I am
is where the magic happens.

1508
01:25:44,536 --> 01:25:45,951
We ain't got to get into specifics.

1509
01:25:45,997 --> 01:25:47,786
Just to make sure you
got all the contacts.

1510
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:49,341
You got the-You got the cell.

1511
01:25:49,366 --> 01:25:50,457
You got my-my email.

1512
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:51,846
- Got 'em all.
- You know, I'ma shoot you

1513
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:53,136
my mom number, too.

1514
01:25:53,175 --> 01:25:55,527
I'ma make sure you got that,
'cause if you can't get me...

1515
01:25:55,621 --> 01:25:56,611
- she can.
- Yeah.

1516
01:25:56,636 --> 01:25:59,105
I got a hotmail address that's
still active, hit me on that.

1517
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,659
Linkedin. That's my profile.

1518
01:26:04,191 --> 01:26:05,386
We're losin' ya.

1519
01:26:08,293 --> 01:26:09,504
That was my phone.

1520
01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:12,199
I hope this brother of yours

1521
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:14,534
is as good a mechanic
as you say he is.

1522
01:26:14,972 --> 01:26:16,870
Jonah's the best
mechanic I know.

1523
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:18,230
And he's gonna help us.

1524
01:26:18,644 --> 01:26:20,300
That is if he doesn't
kill me first.

1525
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:40,460
Yeah, take your time!

1526
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:41,562
Hey, it's only my sister's life

1527
01:26:41,586 --> 01:26:43,577
and the fate of the
world we're waitin' on!

1528
01:26:46,947 --> 01:26:48,385
Ooh, here we go.

1529
01:26:48,417 --> 01:26:50,722
Bet you 50 quid he
punches him in the face.

1530
01:26:50,995 --> 01:26:51,995
Deal.

1531
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:06,577
Jonah.

1532
01:27:07,616 --> 01:27:09,334
You know what comes next.

1533
01:27:10,241 --> 01:27:11,241
Yup.

1534
01:27:14,743 --> 01:27:16,665
See? Not just me.

1535
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:21,389
Your face is all over
the bloody news, boy.

1536
01:27:21,731 --> 01:27:23,098
You know what, come here police.

1537
01:27:23,286 --> 01:27:24,622
You got a bloody cheek.

1538
01:27:24,817 --> 01:27:27,059
Come here after 25 years.

1539
01:27:27,138 --> 01:27:29,372
Bringing your problems here
to this house.

1540
01:27:29,473 --> 01:27:30,903
You betrayed our family.

1541
01:27:30,928 --> 01:27:32,263
Bring shame on our house.

1542
01:27:32,309 --> 01:27:33,786
You betrayed your own blood!

1543
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:37,442
Jonah, I hear you.

1544
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:40,068
But we ain't kids anymore,
you better watch how you talk to me.

1545
01:27:40,092 --> 01:27:42,083
It's not the size of
a dog in a fight, boy.

1546
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,013
Size of the fight in a dog.

1547
01:27:44,161 --> 01:27:46,747
No, it's always
the size of the dog.

1548
01:27:47,676 --> 01:27:48,667
Hey!

1549
01:27:48,692 --> 01:27:50,989
No fighting under this roof, eh!

1550
01:27:52,121 --> 01:27:53,519
Is that my Luke?

1551
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:55,629
Oka!

1552
01:27:56,261 --> 01:27:58,254
My baby's home.

1553
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,521
Hey, Mama.

1554
01:28:01,357 --> 01:28:04,108
Oka, I miss my baby boy.

1555
01:28:04,561 --> 01:28:07,249
Well, look at you,
all skin and bones.

1556
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,827
- Come over here and eat.
- No, no, no, Mama, I just...

1557
01:28:10,233 --> 01:28:11,452
There's no time.

1558
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:13,834
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't
wanna bring trouble here.

1559
01:28:13,858 --> 01:28:15,061
You shoulda stayed away.

1560
01:28:15,116 --> 01:28:16,615
What did you bring here?
What's going on?

1561
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:17,961
- I brought the truth here.
- What truth?

1562
01:28:17,985 --> 01:28:19,155
The truth is we were set up.

1563
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,256
We were framed by the people
who created the deadly virus.

1564
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,335
Oh, come on.

1565
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,428
It could go global
if it's not stopped.

1566
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,170
We could all die, all of us.

1567
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:28,372
Everybody here on this fale,
everybody on the island.

1568
01:28:28,397 --> 01:28:29,678
Everybody around the world.

1569
01:28:29,772 --> 01:28:31,553
Jonah, I need you to
help fix this machine.

1570
01:28:31,616 --> 01:28:33,264
I need you to help my friends.

1571
01:28:33,366 --> 01:28:35,655
And I need us to build
defenses around here now.

1572
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,499
You think you can just
come back in here,

1573
01:28:37,524 --> 01:28:38,937
and we're gonna help you
after everything you did?!

1574
01:28:38,961 --> 01:28:40,342
- Yes!
- Not gonna happen.

1575
01:28:40,397 --> 01:28:41,638
- It's bigger than you and I!
- I don't care!

1576
01:28:41,662 --> 01:28:42,590
It's bigger than you and I!

1577
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:43,499
We could die!

1578
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,796
Good! Because I would
rather die than help you.

1579
01:28:45,936 --> 01:28:47,115
Buddha head.

1580
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:49,718
Listen, I know your brother's
hard to be around.

1581
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:50,905
Believe me.

1582
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,193
But I trust him.

1583
01:28:52,218 --> 01:28:53,827
He belongs here because
this place has something

1584
01:28:53,851 --> 01:28:55,905
that nowhere else
on the planet does.

1585
01:28:56,701 --> 01:28:57,653
You.

1586
01:28:57,678 --> 01:28:59,749
You don't know me,
I don't know you. Okay?

1587
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:01,796
Time for you all to go.
Take your machine with you.

1588
01:29:01,821 --> 01:29:02,925
Go! Now!

1589
01:29:03,173 --> 01:29:04,431
Jonah Hobbs!

1590
01:29:05,956 --> 01:29:08,323
Have some respect for your uso.

1591
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:11,042
If he needs anything,
we're gonna give it to him.

1592
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,393
The food off our tables,
the clothes off our backs.

1593
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:17,205
Even the mana of the islands.

1594
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:20,628
And you boys... All you boys...

1595
01:29:20,816 --> 01:29:22,316
You show our guests here...

1596
01:29:23,847 --> 01:29:25,550
Or so help me God...

1597
01:29:26,214 --> 01:29:28,409
I'm gonna take this
here slipper...

1598
01:29:28,441 --> 01:29:30,808
and I'm gonna sasa
your big fat heads.

1599
01:29:30,988 --> 01:29:32,425
You boys hear me?

1600
01:29:33,597 --> 01:29:35,409
I'm sorry to bring
this here, Mama.

1601
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:37,777
Luke, this is your home.

1602
01:29:38,367 --> 01:29:39,884
We Samoans.

1603
01:29:40,165 --> 01:29:41,884
We can handle troubles.

1604
01:29:55,994 --> 01:29:57,174
You were right.

1605
01:29:58,353 --> 01:30:00,463
You don't turn soldiers like them.

1606
01:30:02,057 --> 01:30:03,486
Do what I built you to do.

1607
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,221
You're a one of a kind
war machine.

1608
01:30:08,994 --> 01:30:10,596
Bring us back my virus.

1609
01:30:11,689 --> 01:30:13,143
No handcuffs this time.

1610
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:16,463
You can have your revenge.

1611
01:30:18,307 --> 01:30:19,338
I will.

1612
01:30:20,197 --> 01:30:21,096
We found them.

1613
01:30:21,174 --> 01:30:22,704
They hopped in an
emergency cargo plane.

1614
01:30:22,728 --> 01:30:23,674
To where?

1615
01:30:23,744 --> 01:30:24,588
Samoa.

1616
01:30:24,635 --> 01:30:25,635
Gentlemen!

1617
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:27,635
This is where you
earn your upgrades.

1618
01:30:28,408 --> 01:30:30,002
Bring me back my virus.

1619
01:30:56,986 --> 01:30:58,228
Quiet little place.

1620
01:30:58,806 --> 01:30:59,814
Yeah.

1621
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,048
A chop shop.

1622
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:02,642
Your dad was a car thief, then?

1623
01:31:02,728 --> 01:31:05,767
Ah, no. My dad
actually stole everything.

1624
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:07,822
Drugs, guns.

1625
01:31:08,072 --> 01:31:09,814
Sounds just like my family.

1626
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:11,822
Mama raised us till
we were teenagers,

1627
01:31:11,847 --> 01:31:13,993
then my old man started
comin' around again.

1628
01:31:14,228 --> 01:31:16,337
Taking a real interest in his sons.

1629
01:31:16,908 --> 01:31:18,915
Truth is, he was just
looking for a new crew.

1630
01:31:19,993 --> 01:31:22,111
And I was the only one to
see through those lies.

1631
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:29,355
So the jobs my dad pulled
me and brothers into

1632
01:31:29,418 --> 01:31:32,395
just got bigger
and more dangerous.

1633
01:31:33,543 --> 01:31:35,637
Then eventually, he knew and...

1634
01:31:36,332 --> 01:31:38,832
he was okay with getting
me and my brothers killed.

1635
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:41,949
So I turned him in.

1636
01:31:42,277 --> 01:31:44,066
Or you protected your family.

1637
01:31:47,736 --> 01:31:49,369
So after I put him away...

1638
01:31:50,111 --> 01:31:51,947
I left Samoa
and I never came back.

1639
01:31:52,002 --> 01:31:53,463
Well, at least one
good thing came out of

1640
01:31:53,487 --> 01:31:55,642
me jamming that
thing into my hand.

1641
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:57,603
Yeah, what's that?

1642
01:31:58,103 --> 01:32:00,478
Got to bring you home, didn't I?

1643
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,244
Lucky me.

1644
01:32:12,381 --> 01:32:13,553
You went legit.

1645
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:14,771
Yeah.

1646
01:32:14,817 --> 01:32:18,169
100% clean now. Custom shop,
international clients.

1647
01:32:18,412 --> 01:32:21,373
See those bikes going Tokyo,
Macau, New York.

1648
01:32:21,443 --> 01:32:22,841
That one over there's
going London.

1649
01:32:23,249 --> 01:32:24,788
Turns out people like our stuff.

1650
01:32:25,969 --> 01:32:28,499
I needed to do something to
hold our family together.

1651
01:32:29,969 --> 01:32:31,430
After you abandoned us.

1652
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,248
Hey, good news,
change of clothes.

1653
01:32:38,297 --> 01:32:39,357
Hatts.

1654
01:32:40,725 --> 01:32:42,623
Hey, your mum said
you might like to wear this.

1655
01:32:42,803 --> 01:32:44,069
Must be your favorite size.

1656
01:32:44,248 --> 01:32:45,248
Spray on.

1657
01:32:46,725 --> 01:32:49,311
Won't you throw another jacket
on, it's 110 degrees out there.

1658
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,084
Hey, look, down to business.

1659
01:32:52,014 --> 01:32:53,366
Got any weapons?

1660
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:55,855
Oh, we got weapons.

1661
01:33:03,739 --> 01:33:05,385
Mama, where's all our guns?

1662
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:06,762
I get rid of 'em.

1663
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,332
Very noble, Mrs. Hobbs.

1664
01:33:10,707 --> 01:33:11,941
We're in serious trouble.

1665
01:33:11,965 --> 01:33:13,582
That is an understatement.

1666
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:14,942
These guns.

1667
01:33:15,848 --> 01:33:17,668
They kill all my family.

1668
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:19,721
So we're gonna fight.

1669
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:21,276
We're gonna fight with this.

1670
01:33:21,807 --> 01:33:23,393
We're gonna fight with this.

1671
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:27,018
'Cause no take a real man
for pull one trigga.

1672
01:33:27,455 --> 01:33:30,112
All right, we're going to war
with the family heirlooms.

1673
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:31,510
Got it.

1674
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:32,542
We're gonna need a lot more.

1675
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:34,229
We're never gonna
survive their firepower.

1676
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,948
Doesn't take a man
to pull a trigger.

1677
01:33:37,088 --> 01:33:39,290
For Eteon, it does take
an activation chip.

1678
01:33:39,315 --> 01:33:40,684
You still got that glove?

1679
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:42,470
Are you thinking
closed system hack?

1680
01:33:42,495 --> 01:33:44,018
Level the playing field
if you can.

1681
01:33:44,049 --> 01:33:45,485
Surely buy us some time.

1682
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,635
Shut their guns down.

1683
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:47,697
I'm on it.

1684
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:50,375
Ready?

1685
01:33:52,953 --> 01:33:54,351
War is what I do.

1686
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:57,070
Let's go old school.

1687
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:00,000
Take a look around.

1688
01:34:00,922 --> 01:34:02,398
This is where we draw the line.

1689
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:05,297
Who woulda thought this is where
we're gonna save the world?

1690
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:07,773
We need to make 'em
play by our rules.

1691
01:34:07,968 --> 01:34:10,914
Tomorrow morning, there'll be a
storm raging on the north cliffs.

1692
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:12,702
We'll build a
no man's land there.

1693
01:34:12,781 --> 01:34:14,148
And if all else fails,

1694
01:34:14,526 --> 01:34:16,539
that'll be our last stand.

1695
01:34:17,023 --> 01:34:19,062
Hey, how many more
of these we gonna do?

1696
01:34:20,843 --> 01:34:22,139
Just keep digging, brother.

1697
01:34:22,917 --> 01:34:24,737
When we were in
Kandahar running raids,

1698
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:27,174
we would always strike
just before dawn.

1699
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:29,143
That's when the
enemy's most tired.

1700
01:34:29,393 --> 01:34:31,034
Still under the cover of night.

1701
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,481
When the battle
shifts into high gear,

1702
01:34:33,506 --> 01:34:34,818
you got the sun in your back.

1703
01:34:35,268 --> 01:34:36,612
We let 'em all in.

1704
01:34:36,903 --> 01:34:38,349
And we make sure
they never leave.

1705
01:34:38,521 --> 01:34:40,372
Kill box. I like it.

1706
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:42,935
Not like we got
a ton of resources.

1707
01:34:43,934 --> 01:34:46,122
But the island
will provide, brother.

1708
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:28,586
- Give me the good news, Hatt.
- I'm in.

1709
01:36:28,632 --> 01:36:30,835
Only thing is, not gonna be
broadcasting a signal off

1710
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,790
to some satellite
for six minutes.

1711
01:36:32,854 --> 01:36:34,776
Six minutes might be
all the time we need.

1712
01:36:35,307 --> 01:36:37,120
Better than a sharp
stick in the eye.

1713
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:39,878
Which is basically all we've
got to fight them with anyway.

1714
01:36:39,956 --> 01:36:41,665
Got more reflex, haven't we?

1715
01:36:59,468 --> 01:37:00,468
Hi.

1716
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:04,203
- Drink?
- Sure.

1717
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:05,781
Thank you.

1718
01:37:09,773 --> 01:37:11,031
Just taking it all in.

1719
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:13,007
In case it's the
last sunset we see.

1720
01:37:20,284 --> 01:37:22,510
I shouldn't have believed
that Deckard went dark.

1721
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:29,307
What he said...

1722
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:32,299
So much time...

1723
01:37:37,378 --> 01:37:39,104
I spent my whole life...

1724
01:37:40,003 --> 01:37:41,151
running away.

1725
01:37:41,971 --> 01:37:42,994
Me, too.

1726
01:37:45,643 --> 01:37:46,674
Yeah.

1727
01:37:48,924 --> 01:37:50,720
I haven't been back
here in 25 years.

1728
01:37:50,745 --> 01:37:53,260
I mean, my own daughter
doesn't even know our family.

1729
01:37:55,103 --> 01:37:56,204
Well...

1730
01:37:57,603 --> 01:37:59,212
You can change that.

1731
01:38:03,704 --> 01:38:04,704
Yeah.

1732
01:38:05,844 --> 01:38:07,000
So can you.

1733
01:38:08,429 --> 01:38:09,312
Got an idea.

1734
01:38:09,337 --> 01:38:11,845
Why don't you and I make a
promise right here, right now?

1735
01:38:12,306 --> 01:38:14,946
That when we see
tomorrow's sunset...

1736
01:38:15,571 --> 01:38:17,376
we begin to fix the
mistakes we made.

1737
01:38:27,718 --> 01:38:30,553
That just sealed it,
so you can't back out. That's all.

1738
01:38:34,427 --> 01:38:36,841
I don't think there's any chance
in hell I'm gonna back out.

1739
01:38:38,466 --> 01:38:39,911
You wanna seal it again, or?

1740
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:41,817
- Definitely not.
- Okay.

1741
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:43,833
Maybe tomorrow if I survive.

1742
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:48,283
Jonah?

1743
01:38:48,108 --> 01:38:49,146
Don't rush me.

1744
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:51,194
It's almost dawn.
He'll be here soon.

1745
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,559
Make it happen now.

1746
01:38:53,045 --> 01:38:54,309
- Now!
- Hey, hey, hey.

1747
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:55,957
Don't rush me. That's
how mistakes are made.

1748
01:38:55,981 --> 01:38:57,715
And how long does
this process take?

1749
01:38:57,778 --> 01:39:00,004
It's 30 minutes,
and 33 till I go viral.

1750
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:02,746
Look, Deck, I think we need to
seriously consider option one.

1751
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,497
Don't strike a match
just yet, Hatts.

1752
01:39:04,559 --> 01:39:06,489
We are seriously gonna
miss this window.

1753
01:39:06,551 --> 01:39:07,597
Let's do this, come on!

1754
01:39:07,622 --> 01:39:08,660
Jonah, now!

1755
01:39:08,794 --> 01:39:10,387
Fine! Fine! Okay.

1756
01:39:10,817 --> 01:39:12,380
Here goes... nothing.

1757
01:39:13,326 --> 01:39:14,827
Brace yourself, Hatts.

1758
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:16,921
It ain't gonna be pleasant.

1759
01:39:16,945 --> 01:39:18,272
No, it's gonna be fine.

1760
01:39:20,195 --> 01:39:21,273
God!

1761
01:39:34,138 --> 01:39:35,138
It's working!

1762
01:39:35,318 --> 01:39:36,318
It's working!

1763
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:38,771
Yeah!

1764
01:39:43,868 --> 01:39:45,478
Hey, triggered the alarm.

1765
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,220
That's him.

1766
01:39:47,579 --> 01:39:48,626
As we planned?

1767
01:39:48,954 --> 01:39:50,064
As we planned.

1768
01:39:50,407 --> 01:39:51,563
Usos!

1769
01:39:54,228 --> 01:39:55,259
It's time.

1770
01:39:59,256 --> 01:40:00,350
Jonah...

1771
01:40:05,449 --> 01:40:07,090
Just wanna say that, uh...

1772
01:40:08,371 --> 01:40:10,004
If this thing goes sideways and...

1773
01:40:11,566 --> 01:40:12,840
And this is it...

1774
01:40:16,145 --> 01:40:17,324
I'm sorry.

1775
01:40:19,609 --> 01:40:22,047
I've had my reasons
but the fact is...

1776
01:40:24,866 --> 01:40:27,647
I left you. And I left our tina.

1777
01:40:32,233 --> 01:40:33,679
I should have come home.

1778
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,640
And if we make it through this...

1779
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:39,031
you have my word,
I'll never let that happen again.

1780
01:40:43,065 --> 01:40:44,206
I love you, uso.

1781
01:40:52,457 --> 01:40:53,847
I love you, too, uso.

1782
01:41:01,006 --> 01:41:02,006
Okay.

1783
01:41:02,654 --> 01:41:03,842
You're mobile.

1784
01:41:06,903 --> 01:41:09,036
Do you think we need to be
so close to the front line?

1785
01:41:09,099 --> 01:41:10,738
Yeah, keep you close,
keep an eye on you,

1786
01:41:10,763 --> 01:41:12,513
in case we need to
make a quick getaway.

1787
01:41:13,005 --> 01:41:14,834
Hey, this is what we do, right?

1788
01:41:16,176 --> 01:41:17,333
It is what we do.

1789
01:41:19,841 --> 01:41:20,958
Deck, um...

1790
01:41:24,997 --> 01:41:26,973
I overheard what Brixton said.

1791
01:41:29,356 --> 01:41:31,255
That you stayed
away to protect us.

1792
01:41:34,106 --> 01:41:36,083
I never should've
believed that stuff.

1793
01:41:39,129 --> 01:41:41,863
Why did I...? Sorry... Don't be.

1794
01:41:42,722 --> 01:41:43,800
Don't be.

1795
01:41:43,886 --> 01:41:45,488
Look, I've done things...

1796
01:41:46,519 --> 01:41:48,144
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

1797
01:41:49,285 --> 01:41:50,519
Things I...

1798
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:52,855
have to make amends for.

1799
01:41:53,221 --> 01:41:55,731
Things that bastard
put me through.

1800
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:58,018
But right now,

1801
01:41:58,043 --> 01:41:59,472
the most important
thing to me...

1802
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:01,660
is to get my little
sister home safely.

1803
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,692
Eteon hold!

1804
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,500
Usos!

1805
01:42:52,761 --> 01:42:54,227
Samoa!

1806
01:42:56,398 --> 01:42:59,718
I call to my ancestors.

1807
01:43:01,211 --> 01:43:04,359
This land was nourished.

1808
01:43:05,852 --> 01:43:07,680
With blood.

1809
01:43:09,027 --> 01:43:11,492
Now it will be
nourished with yours.

1810
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,438
Let's go!

1811
01:43:16,078 --> 01:43:17,078
Do it.

1812
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:18,383
Light 'em up!

1813
01:43:27,195 --> 01:43:29,164
How long before the
guns get back online?

1814
01:43:29,305 --> 01:43:30,328
I have no idea.

1815
01:43:41,289 --> 01:43:43,184
Let's fight!

1816
01:44:00,437 --> 01:44:01,789
Shaw.

1817
01:44:07,445 --> 01:44:08,593
Air command.

1818
01:44:10,182 --> 01:44:11,546
Bring me the chopper.

1819
01:45:22,063 --> 01:45:23,103
Decks!

1820
01:45:42,309 --> 01:45:43,489
Do it quick, Hatts.

1821
01:45:43,888 --> 01:45:44,981
It's in, it's in, it's in.

1822
01:45:45,083 --> 01:45:46,630
- Is it working?
- Machine's on.

1823
01:45:49,395 --> 01:45:50,825
- We're good.
- Let's go.

1824
01:47:02,468 --> 01:47:03,468
Hobbs!

1825
01:47:26,867 --> 01:47:28,000
Go! Go!

1826
01:47:31,955 --> 01:47:33,354
Let's go fishin', Shaw!

1827
01:47:33,526 --> 01:47:35,370
You catch him, I'll gut him!

1828
01:47:40,862 --> 01:47:42,081
Hold on!

1829
01:48:03,953 --> 01:48:06,351
Welcome to my island, you...
Take it up!

1830
01:48:19,477 --> 01:48:21,117
You get us close
and I'll get him!

1831
01:48:21,711 --> 01:48:24,102
I'll keep his nose down,
you reel him in!

1832
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:35,485
Take it up! Take it up!

1833
01:48:40,673 --> 01:48:41,680
Get out!

1834
01:48:45,126 --> 01:48:46,220
And they're off.

1835
01:49:03,247 --> 01:49:04,262
What are you doing?

1836
01:49:04,614 --> 01:49:06,066
I'm going for a ride!

1837
01:49:11,278 --> 01:49:12,380
Shit.

1838
01:49:12,888 --> 01:49:14,544
We're coming, uso!

1839
01:49:14,661 --> 01:49:15,700
Ya-hoo!

1840
01:49:21,384 --> 01:49:22,556
Let's go, Jonah!

1841
01:49:22,705 --> 01:49:23,814
I'm coming, brother.

1842
01:49:25,432 --> 01:49:26,947
The axle, the axle!

1843
01:49:46,072 --> 01:49:47,439
Timo, you got this!

1844
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,166
We're gonna need more weight!

1845
01:50:05,173 --> 01:50:06,173
Yeah!

1846
01:50:14,688 --> 01:50:16,524
We need nice and easy, clean!

1847
01:50:19,883 --> 01:50:21,461
Hell yeah, usos!

1848
01:50:24,137 --> 01:50:25,127
There's too much weight!

1849
01:50:25,152 --> 01:50:26,465
All right, drop 'em!

1850
01:50:43,911 --> 01:50:45,567
Hit 'em with the moonshine!

1851
01:50:45,592 --> 01:50:46,786
Now!

1852
01:51:13,064 --> 01:51:14,510
Hang me off a cliff, huh?

1853
01:51:15,064 --> 01:51:16,134
My turn.

1854
01:51:19,703 --> 01:51:21,586
Sir, the weapons
are back online.

1855
01:51:21,664 --> 01:51:22,937
Let's go! Let's go!

1856
01:51:24,562 --> 01:51:25,648
Goodbye.

1857
01:51:27,188 --> 01:51:28,430
Incoming!

1858
01:51:38,744 --> 01:51:40,502
We got a little trouble
back here, Shaw!

1859
01:51:40,564 --> 01:51:42,212
Approaching no man's land!

1860
01:51:55,147 --> 01:51:56,217
Let's get this done!

1861
01:52:13,432 --> 01:52:15,198
All right, now hit that stake!

1862
01:52:29,496 --> 01:52:30,645
We're losing the rotors!

1863
01:52:42,352 --> 01:52:43,493
Gotcha Hobbs.

1864
01:52:51,372 --> 01:52:52,372
Hey!

1865
01:52:58,661 --> 01:52:59,897
The road's out!

1866
01:52:59,943 --> 01:53:01,037
Losing power!

1867
01:53:04,333 --> 01:53:05,247
Hobbs!

1868
01:53:05,272 --> 01:53:06,811
Hattie! Jump!

1869
01:53:09,447 --> 01:53:10,634
Come on!

1870
01:53:58,806 --> 01:53:59,837
Hey, get up!

1871
01:54:00,063 --> 01:54:01,063
Get up!

1872
01:54:01,688 --> 01:54:03,056
Hey, get up!

1873
01:54:03,313 --> 01:54:05,454
You don't die until
I tell you to die!

1874
01:54:05,798 --> 01:54:08,836
You see the extraction timer,
when it hits zero...

1875
01:54:09,087 --> 01:54:11,649
empty this clip into her heart.
Do you understand?

1876
01:54:22,637 --> 01:54:23,965
Hattie!

1877
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:28,482
This doesn't end your way, boys!

1878
01:54:29,177 --> 01:54:31,045
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

1879
01:54:31,216 --> 01:54:34,068
Nah, the numbers
don't add up for you.

1880
01:54:34,396 --> 01:54:35,653
The evolution of man

1881
01:54:35,693 --> 01:54:37,560
is coming whether
you like it or not.

1882
01:54:40,662 --> 01:54:42,521
You know, I almost
feel bad for you.

1883
01:54:42,995 --> 01:54:45,073
It's not the smell that
fills your head with.

1884
01:54:45,269 --> 01:54:46,816
It's bullshit.

1885
01:54:48,956 --> 01:54:51,120
I was beginning to like
you two, you know that?

1886
01:54:52,941 --> 01:54:54,050
Oh, well.

1887
01:55:29,812 --> 01:55:32,281
What's the problem boys?
Does it hurt?

1888
01:55:33,078 --> 01:55:35,070
Must be hard being so...

1889
01:55:35,797 --> 01:55:37,031
human!

1890
01:56:07,901 --> 01:56:08,901
You seen that?

1891
01:56:09,284 --> 01:56:10,612
We work together,
we can hurt him.

1892
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:11,674
You're right.

1893
01:56:12,471 --> 01:56:13,752
Time to work as a team.

1894
01:56:13,885 --> 01:56:15,165
There's two of us
and one of him.

1895
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:17,221
I'll take a punch
and let you land one.

1896
01:56:17,301 --> 01:56:18,520
I'll do the same.

1897
01:56:19,512 --> 01:56:20,645
Got your back, brother.

1898
01:56:20,911 --> 01:56:22,028
And I got yours.

1899
01:56:22,707 --> 01:56:24,442
Let's go unplug this sumbitch.

1900

1901
01:58:16,842 --> 01:58:18,241
Here comes the Kryptonite.

1902
01:58:34,212 --> 01:58:35,290
I got it.

1903
01:58:35,782 --> 01:58:36,993
You did it, Hatt.

1904
01:58:37,392 --> 01:58:38,743
Never had a doubt.

1905
01:58:40,134 --> 01:58:41,907
Let's get it into safe hands.

1906
01:58:47,861 --> 01:58:49,978
You set me up as a traitor.

1907
01:58:51,361 --> 01:58:53,634
Turned my own sister against me.

1908
01:58:54,814 --> 01:58:57,267
Forced me to kill
my own brother!

1909
01:58:57,939 --> 01:58:59,039
You!

1910
01:58:59,064 --> 01:59:01,282
And here we are again. Come on!

1911
01:59:02,978 --> 01:59:04,986
Shaw, come back to the cause.

1912
01:59:08,282 --> 01:59:10,392
One life doesn't mean anything.

1913
01:59:10,704 --> 01:59:12,446
I don't know what happened
to you, Brixton.

1914
01:59:15,837 --> 01:59:17,548
But you made me kill you once.

1915
01:59:19,837 --> 01:59:21,548
I ain't doin' it again.

1916
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:28,781
Brother,
you may believe in machines...

1917
01:59:30,422 --> 01:59:31,727
but we believe in people.

1918
01:59:40,204 --> 01:59:42,572
You may have all the
technology in the world.

1919
01:59:46,367 --> 01:59:47,625
We have heart.

1920
01:59:49,834 --> 01:59:52,115
No machine will ever beat that.

1921
01:59:54,529 --> 01:59:55,670
You boys...

1922
01:59:55,779 --> 01:59:58,201
You're gonna get one
Samoan ass-whooping.

1923
02:00:07,756 --> 02:00:09,850
Shut Brixton down.

1924
02:00:18,396 --> 02:00:19,967
That's how it is.

1925
02:00:23,818 --> 02:00:25,795
It's a hell of a business, boys.

1926
02:00:43,798 --> 02:00:47,079
Brixton never really lived up
to our expectations.

1927
02:00:48,032 --> 02:00:49,407
But you three...

1928
02:00:49,978 --> 02:00:52,009
You outperformed your analytics.

1929
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:55,802
You don't remember me,
do you, Hobbs? Hmm?

1930
02:00:57,007 --> 02:00:58,046
You will.

1931
02:00:59,194 --> 02:01:00,897
It's gonna be
a hell of a reunion.

1932
02:01:03,065 --> 02:01:04,987
You're on our radar now.

1933
02:01:06,206 --> 02:01:07,604
And you're on ours.

1934
02:01:16,711 --> 02:01:19,281
Hey, thanks for being my sidekick
through this whole thing, brother.

1935
02:01:19,305 --> 02:01:20,352
You were great.

1936
02:01:20,836 --> 02:01:23,071
How 'bout I sidekick that
stupid look on your face?

1937
02:01:23,096 --> 02:01:24,470
Yeah? How 'bout you
show me right now?

1938
02:01:24,494 --> 02:01:27,626
Okay, guys... Let's go home.

1939
02:01:30,969 --> 02:01:31,977
Yeah.

1940
02:01:33,594 --> 02:01:36,250
Look, Batman had Robin,
Dr. Evil had Mini-Me.

1941
02:01:36,391 --> 02:01:38,586
- You're my Mini-Me.
- Han Solo had Chewbacca.

1942
02:01:38,611 --> 02:01:39,665
Kermit had Miss Piggy.

1943
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:40,946

1
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:11,088
He's known as Kat but his full name
is Stanislav Katczinsky.

2
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:16,218
He's the leader of our group with
a remarkable nose for good food and dirty weather,

3
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,638
but most of all for food
when there's none to be had.

4
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,649
My name is Paul Baumer.
I am 18 years old.

5
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,235
A few months ago,
six of us were classmates,

6
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,990
our heads were stuffed with knowledge,
filled with ideals and hopes.

7
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,373
Josef Behm, who will study theology.

8
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,882
Albert Kropp, who will study law.

9
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,682
Friedrich Müller,
who will study everything.

10
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,317
Franz Kemmerich,
who will be a forester.

11
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,909
Peter Leer,
who will travel and make love.

12
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,333
We are with our friends:
Tjaden, a locksmith before the war.

13
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,752
The biggest eater of the company.

14
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,761
Haie Westus, who dug peat for a living.
A good man to have on your side.

15
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,643
And Detering, a farmer who thinks
of nothing but his horses,

16
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,646
his farmyard and his wife.

17
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,650
For months we've fought the French
for a hundred yards of earth.

18
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,986
They attack our trench.
We attack their trench.

19
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:02,491
Then, to keep the score even,
they will attack our trench once again.

20
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,839
What are you doing? Wait.

21
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,759
Over here. Here, over here.

22
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,063
You'll be OK.

23
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,359
OK, here we come. Come.

24
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,902
Quick.

25
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,820
Easy... easy.

26
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,458
It's his leg. He's lucky.

27
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:11,132
He'll be all right.

28
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,640
You are our Iron Youth.

29
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,811
Iron Youth becomes Iron Heroes.

30
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:29,234
It is my duty. Uh, it is my honour,

31
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:36,324
to prepare you for the part
you must play in this great war.

32
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:42,622
Our homeland has need
of men of character and strong will.

33
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,002
It is my duty to prepare your minds

34
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,339
so that you will be better able
to train your bodies

35
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,885
for your Kaiser, for your Fatherland,

36
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,514
for your God.

37
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,852
For upon you
rests the fate of the Fatherland

38
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:10,442
and upon the fate of the Fatherland
rests the fate of the world.

39
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,531
Germany is the nation of progress,

40
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,325
the nation of culture...

41
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:23,163
the nation of science,
the nation of ideas...

42
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,252
the nation of Beethoven,

43
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,423
of Schiller, of Goethe...

44
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,886
Baumer.

45
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,346
Sir.

46
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,016
What is that?

47
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,893
A bird, sir.

48
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,978
- A bird?
- Yes, sir.

49
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,146
A lark?

50
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,981
- Yes, sir.
- Very good.

51
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,441
On the window.

52
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,151
- This line...
- The window.

53
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,695
- Very exact.
- Thank you, sir.

54
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:02,744
But you do not come here to draw,
to write poems... or to dream.

55
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,580
Do you Baumer?

56
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,415
No.

57
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,961
Sit down.

58
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:18,051
Gentlemen, you have all passed
your examinations.

59
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,595
As you know, you are graduated.

60
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,265
The time for class is over.

61
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,812
The time for duty has begun.

62
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,359
You are dismissed. Herr Baumer...

63
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,279
You may stay.

64
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,338
Cigarette?

65
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,007
No, thank you, sir.

66
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,468
Oh, you don't smoke.

67
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,138
Well, it is not a good habit.

68
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,975
But all good habits,
makes a dull person.

69
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,518
What do the English say?

70
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,646
- All work and no play makes...
- A dull man.

71
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,983
A dull... Yes, yes, very good.

72
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,778
So you see, you have learned
something here after all.

73
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,990
There is a time for work
and there is a time for play.

74
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:27,162
You are graduating.
The time for play is over.

75
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,457
You are a dreamer, Baumer.

76
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,960
You draw little sketches
and write little poems.

77
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:38,006
But now you're a man,
you have your duties as a man,

78
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,383
your duty to the Fatherland.

79
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,931
Will you wait to be called up
or will you enlist?

80
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,099
Well...

81
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,643
Of course, you'll respond
to your call of duty.

82
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,395
You will all respond.

83
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,567
The entire class will go
as one man to serve the Fatherland.

84
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,365
I know I will be proud of you,
Baumer.

85
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,212
If you could get enough sleep,
it wouldn't be a bad little war.

86
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,173
- If you could get enough food.
- If you could get enough women.

87
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,560
Come on, Heinrich, open up, we're hungry.

88
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,146
You know the regulations.
You must all be here.

89
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,317
We are here!

90
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,029
Don't lie to me. I've got food for 150 men

91
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,532
and I don't serve
until the rest of you get here.

92
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,410
The rest are either in the dressing station
or pushing up the daisies!

93
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,080
Well, I've cooked for 150 men.

94
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,708
Ah! So then we'll all have enough.
For once!

95
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,461
- You've got bread for 150 men?
- Yeah.

96
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,755
- And sausages?
- Tobacco?

97
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,632
- Yeah, but...
- Good, let's have it!

98
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,927
So let's see, that's enough bread for er...

99
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,846
Double portions!

100
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,098
Is that right? Double!

101
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,601
I can only issue rations to 80 men.

102
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,728
Here's Lieutenant Bertinck.

103
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,189
The beans smell delicious, Sergeant.

104
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,566
Thank you, sir.

105
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,365
It would be nice to see this once in a while
at the front. Eh, Katczinsky?

106
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,368
Yes, sir! That's right, sir.

107
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,788
Eat hearty.

108
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,249
Thank you, sir.

109
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,545
- Come on, belly robber, you heard him.
- Yeah, but he didn't say...

110
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,840
Look, you... We are the Second Company.

111
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,301
You are the cook for the Second Company.

112
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,930
You didn't make food for 80 men,
you made food for the Second Company.

113
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,475
And we, damn you,
we are the Second Company!

114
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,020
Well, it isn't right.

115
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,688
Come on!

116
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,399
Come on, stop cheating.

117
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:07,113
It's not right. There should be a system.

118
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,620
It's not right. I cook all this food...

119
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,288
Come on, come on! Double!

120
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,882
Today is wonderfully good.

121
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,720
Every one of us has eaten for two men
and the mail has come.

122
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,014
The grasses sway like tall spears.

123
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,602
The white butterflies
float on the soft warm wind.

124
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,066
How often in the last few days
have we come to the edge of death?

125
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,234
Let's not even think about it.

126
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,779
Let's just enjoy the world.

127
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,448
Everything is new and brave.

128
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,243
Red poppies, the good food,

129
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,288
cigarettes and the summer breeze.

130
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,539
Paul? Paul?

131
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,877
We're going to see Kemmerich.

132
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,949
Nurse, can you tell me
where Franz Kemmerich is?

133
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,118
Yes, he's through there.

134
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,728
Franz.

135
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,855
How are you?

136
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,024
Someone stole my watch.

137
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,526
- Bastards!
- I warned you, Franz.

138
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,446
- I know.
- We'll tell the doctor.

139
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,034
You'll be going home soon.

140
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,368
Do you think?

141
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,996
- Any day.
- You look fine, Franz.

142
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,416
I feel... I'm all right.

143
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,756
My foot. It's so painful.

144
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,593
It's so cold.

145
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,179
That pain is your ticket home.

146
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,015
You should be grateful to that pain.

147
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,520
In a week you'll be smoking cigars
on Frau Hammerschmidt's front porch,

148
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,397
telling big fat lies
to Katrine Hammerschmidt.

149
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,652
We got you some smokes
and a piece of cheese from Kat,

150
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,821
and your comb is in the tobacco tin.

151
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,783
Put them under the bed, please.

152
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,829
Hide them.
You know they stole my watch.

153
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:51,129
Franz, will you be taking
these back home with you?

154
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,090
Why not?

155
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,551
Well, you don't really need
boots back home.

156
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,469
We could do a trade. I've got...

157
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,347
No! My mother gave me those boots.

158
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,934
- Maybe you could lend them to me?
- No.

159
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,979
You'll be home a lot sooner than us.

160
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,982
That's right, you won't have
to wait for leave now.

161
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,444
Orderly. Orderly!

162
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,114
They don't come. They never come.

163
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,365
We'll get someone.

164
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,577
- It'll be different when you get home.
- When you come back...

165
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,745
- We'll be together.
- We'll come tomorrow.

166
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,666
- I'll come tomorrow.
- Thank you. Thank you.

167
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,836
I'll be back.

168
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,213
Make sure you get my watch.

169
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,882
We will.

170
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,280
You think I don't care about Franz.

171
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,324
Of course I care.

172
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,996
If I could save his leg or life, I'd
walk over barbed wire. You know that.

173
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,458
But where he's going,
he isn't going to need his boots.

174
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,001
He isn't going to need anything.

175
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,795
And my boots hurt. They really hurt.

176
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,632
Why should some damn orderly
get his boots

177
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,717
and not one of his friends?

178
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,804
He's right, Paul.

179
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,356
I know.

180
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,241
Very good, Kemmerich.

181
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,792
Very good, Kemmerich.

182
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,838
They've amputated my leg.

183
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,678
Could be worse.

184
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,848
Wegler lost his right arm,
which is very much worse.

185
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,019
Besides, you're going home.

186
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,355
Do you think so?

187
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,731
Of course.

188
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,942
Do you think so?

189
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,197
Once you get over the operation.

190
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,827
I don't think so.

191
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,707
Don't talk nonsense.

192
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,879
I wanted to be a forester once.

193
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,052
You will.

194
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:53,102
They... They make wonderful...
artificial limbs... now.

195
00:21:55,022 --> 00:22:00,234
Attach them right to the muscle.
You can do anything.

196
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:06,574
If you find my watch, send it home.

197
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,413
You'll go to a convalescent home.

198
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,915
Maybe the one in Klosterberg.

199
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,255
Remember how we used to hike up there?

200
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,299
Remember the poplars?

201
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,761
The stream full of fish?

202
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:36,187
Franz, Franz... When I come back,
we go up to the mountains again.

203
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,483
You can name all the trees for me.

204
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,860
Tell me all about them.

205
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,615
Franz, nothing will change.

206
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,619
We'd be together again.

207
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,999
Franz? Franz.

208
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:04,965
Give... Müller... my... boots.

209
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,642
Doctor? Doctor?
Where's the doctor? Doctor!

210
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,978
Doctor!

211
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,648
Where's the doctor? Doctor?

212
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,319
Doctor! Quickly,
Franz Kemmerich is dying.

213
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,155
- Which one is that?
- Bed 36, amputated leg.

214
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,951
How should I know that?
I've amputated five legs today.

215
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,828
You see to it.

216
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,039
One operation after another
since five o'clock this morning.

217
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:41,293
Today there have been sixteen deaths,
yours will be the seventeenth.

218
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,879
There'll probably be twenty altogether.

219
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,845
We'll have to take him away at once.
We need the bed.

220
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,681
They're lying on the floor outside.

221
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,914
Don't forget, change your socks every day.

222
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,583
- Oh, Mother!
- I won't.

223
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,878
- Paul.
- Yes, Mrs. Kemmerich?

224
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,172
Please, may we speak a minute?

225
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,470
- I want you to promise me something.
- What, Mrs. Kemmerich?

226
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,055
- Look after Franz.
- Of course...

227
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:39,727
He looks up to you.
He'll do anything you ask, you know?

228
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,230
Make him stay away from danger.
You know how reckless he is.

229
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,942
- I'll make sure he behaves himself.
- Thank you.

230
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,861
God bless you, Paul.

231
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,238
Maria, Maria.

232
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,412
Look after your brother.

233
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,250
I'll see you soon. Take care.
Bye-bye, Mother, bye-bye.

234
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,586
Take care, Father!

235
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,965
Right, come on, boys. Wake up!

236
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,802
Let's go. Hey, wake up there.
Come on.

237
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,721
Come on, come on, Come on!

238
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,642
It's beautiful here. Come on.

239
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,353
Let's go. Wake up. Food.

240
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,565
Come on.

241
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,656
Oh, Kat.
I don't know how you do it.

242
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,910
Next time you come with me,
I'll show you how to find food.

243
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,038
Someday when I'm not here,
it'll come in handy.

244
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,915
What? You'll always be here.

245
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,002
Ah, up here
"always" isn't a long time.

246
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,005
Anyway, you'd better learn
so you won't go hungry.

247
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,507
You pay attention to the teacher.

248
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,890
He's coming. He's coming.

249
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,354
- What did he want?
- Doesn't matter. We're free.

250
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:52,151
It is time for work, for duty.
You will enlist, the entire class.

251
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,820
- Of course.
- Behm, you too.

252
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,032
- They might not accept me. My eyes.
- They will.

253
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,534
But not tonight.
Tonight we get drunk.

254
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,538

255
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,874

In those ten weeks, you will become
German soldiers.

Good morning,

I'm your training officer.

00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,516
Forward march.

324
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,397
Left, left, left, left, left.

325
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,066
Left, left, left.

326
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:11,196
Left, left, left. Squad...

327
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,199
Right turn... march.

328
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:21,623
Turn! Left! Left! Left!
Left! Left! Squad!

329
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,500
Attention!

330
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,796
Right face!

331
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,841
Eyes front!

332
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,135
Right face!

333
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,346
Forward march!

334
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,392
Left! Left! Squad!

335
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,811
On the double.

336
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,604
Quick march!

337
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,941
Left, left, left. Squad!

338
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,694
Right turn... March!

339
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:58,285
Left, left, left, left.
Left, left, left, left... Squad!

340
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,038
Right turn... March!

341
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:06,043
Left, left, left, left, left, left,

342
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,589
left, left, left, left, left, left,

343
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:15,552
left, left, left...
Squad! Lie down!

344
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,599
Ready.

345
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,267
Stand up!

346
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,729
Advance.

347
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,357
Lie down.

348
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,402
Ready...

349
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,988
Stand up!

350
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,200
Advance.

351
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,079
Lie down!

352
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,916
Ready...

353
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,168
Stand up.

354
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,713
Advance.

355
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,301
Into the barracks. Inspection in 30 minutes.

356
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,888
Dismiss!

357
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,380
Lie down!

358
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,842
Ready...

359
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,051
Stand up!

360
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,471
Advance.

361
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,934
Lie down!

362
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,354
Ready...

363
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,564
Stand up!

364
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,359
Advance.

365
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,280
Lie down!

366
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,575
Ready...

367
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,535
Stand up!

368
00:36:48,497 --> 00:37:32,707
Again.

369
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,596
Come on, up, up, up, up.

370
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,431
Come on. Come on.

371
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,351
You.

372
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:43,945
Again!

373
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,843
Baumer.

374
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:16,728
Again.

375
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,736
You'll pay for this, Baumer.

376
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,865
Rifle. Fill your pack.

377
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,784
No, no, Corporal.

378
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,537
You must keep
your eyes open, Corporal.

379
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,669
Attack!

380
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,007
Lay down!

381
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,158
Your training days are over.

382
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,621
You are soldiers now
in the Imperial Army.

383
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,709
Fit and ready to do battle
for the Kaiser and the Fatherland.

384
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:32,298
In the front lines you will understand
the value and the purpose

385
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,634
of everything you have learned here,

386
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,762
everything your officers
have taught you.

387
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,183
Their ways may have sometimes
seemed harsh to you,

388
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,602
but you will thank
your fine instructors

389
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,855
for the lessons
they taught you in this camp.

390
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,943
They have taught you to be soldiers.

391
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,446
To be soldiers
in the service of Almighty God,

392
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,616
the Kaiser and the Fatherland.

393
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,122
Right... face.

394
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,295
Forward... march.

395
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,387
Forward... march.

396
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,917
Open up.

397
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,529
Shoulder weapons.

398
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,746
Right face.

399
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,500
Board the train.

400
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,236
No smoking.

401
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,157
No smoking.

402
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,046
Fifth Company, get down.
Hold up.

403
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,302
Second Company.
This way. Fall out, two ranks.

404
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,964
So... Here you are.

405
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,681
It's the custom to assign
one old hand to every new platoon.

406
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,225
You're the new platoon.

407
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,561
I'm the old hand.

408
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:43,401
In training camp they filled you with fancy
information on how to be a soldier.

409
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,488
We're going to work hard
to forget all that.

410
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:52,118
I'll teach you practic...
Listen to me, boy.

411
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,996
I'll teach you practical things.

412
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,291
Like how to put your diapers on
in the front lines.

413
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,835
And how to kill Frenchies.

414
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,257
You won't have long to wait
before I baptise you.

415
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,760
First we'll give you some hot food,
let you get some sleep,

416
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,263
then I'll take you out
on your first patrol...

417
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,057
...tonight.

418
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:44,253
Those deep booms,
that's the heavy artillery.

419
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,049
They're heading behind us, so don't worry.

420
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:53,095
They always come in threes,
they always fall close together.

421
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:58,184
You've got five to ten seconds between
each round to get where you wanna go.

422
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,103
You can hear them coming a long way off,
that's the good thing.

423
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,022
Same with the mortar.

424
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,859
But the thing you gotta listen good for
is the "Eeee!"

425
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,694
Like a mosquito.

426
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,906
That's the small stuff they call daisy-cutters.

427
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,284
You've only got three seconds
before they hit you.

428
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,870
Don't wait for anything!

429
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,291
Up here you've got to learn to trust
your animal instinct.

430
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,001
You understand?

431
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:31,676
So... Don't wait. Move. When you're up this
close and you hear something, anything,

432
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,719
hit the ground - fast.

433
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,222
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

434
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,272
All right, boys.
There's gonna be some fireworks.

435
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,650
Frenchie wants to say hello.

436
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,737
You just stick close to Kat,

437
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,991
and move when I tell you to move.

438
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:03,290
All right, take cover.
Get off the road. Quick, quick!

439
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,005
Get down. Off the road.

440
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,508
Take cover. Off the road!

441
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,457
Shoot the wounded horses!

442
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,250
Shoot them!

443
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,136
Shoot them, can't you?

444
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,804
Shoot them!

445
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,733
Hey! You crazy?
You want to kill somebody?

446
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:11,776
Get down.

447
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:43,182
Why? What have they done?
They haven't done anything.

448
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:51,357
Using horses is wrong.
It's wrong killing horses.

449
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,154
All right, boys.
Frenchie's finished with you.

450
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,865
Come on, let's go, boys.

451
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,867
Get up.

452
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,043
Up. Come on, boys.

453
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,885
Everybody here?

454
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,514
Huh? Link up, boys.

455
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,814
That's just a taste of the real thing.
You'll get used to it.

456
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,150
You ready?

457
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,901
All right.

458
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,241
Well, you're almost getting
to be soldiers now.

459
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,370
You stick with Kat
and you'll be all right.

460
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,724
We have been at the front for a year.
We are soldiers now.

461
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,809
We know this place well.

462
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,936
We are at home.

463
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:15,733
Only Kemmerich is dead but we keep
hearing about others in our class -

464
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,152
dead, wounded.

465
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,991
Always, over every one of us,
hangs the element of chance.

466
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,161
If a shot comes,
all we can do is duck,

467
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,914
because we can never know
where it will fall.

468
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,299
I can be smashed to bits
in a bomb-proof dugout,

469
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,469
or I can survive ten hours
unscathed out in the open.

470
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,856
Of course, every soldier believes
in chance and trusts his luck.

471
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,651
But no soldier outlives
a thousand chances.

472
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,697
Flamethrowers. A new invention.

473
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,159
To the list of ways by which the keenest
minds in the world

474
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,578
are making it easy to kill one another,

475
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,957
add this miracle of modern
industrial ingenuity.

476
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,333
Incineration.

477
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,507
The rats here are particularly repulsive.
They are so fat.

478
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,634
We call them corpse rats.

479
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,596
They have shocking evil faces
and even on our empty stomachs,

480
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,766
it is nauseating
to see their long naked tails.

481
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:41,902
The bait is bread, which is so rotten
that even we won't eat it.

482
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,699
These rats are so brazen.
If we make a pile of rotten crusts,

483
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,785
they'll come right among us
to snatch them away.

484
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,292
It's a way to pass the time.

485
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,058
Gas gas! Gas gas!

486
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:59,021
Gas, the most feared,
the most obscene weapon of all.

487
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,483
We remember the awful sights
in the hospital.

488
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,110
The gas patients who, suffocating,

489
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,821
cough up their burnt lungs in clots.

490
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,657
Better to take your chances
in the open

491
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,953
rather than stay in the hollows
where the vapours settle.

492
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,981
The new recruits give us more trouble
than they are worth.

493
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,609
Between five and ten of them
get killed to every old hand.

494
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,155
And they get killed simply
because they are so inexperienced.

495
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:35,033
They know nothing,
so they die like flies.

496
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,120
No, don't! No!

497
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,872
Get him.

498
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,565
Hand me a rifle. Hand me a rifle.

499
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,490
Kat, wait!

500
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,760
A baby.

501
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,223
Just a baby.

502
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:20,055
Mind the wire.

503
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,445
They're in position.

504
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,656
- Nearby?
- Yes, sir.

505
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,366
How long has it been?

506
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:43,161
Weeks, months, years?

507
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,746
Only days.

508
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,208
Yesterday we were under fire.
Today we can rest.

509
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,628
Tomorrow we go up
to the trenches again.

510
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,323
Boys, boys, come here.

511
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,075
Look, you fellas go on that side.

512
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,036
Over here. This way.

513
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,829
Easy, easy.

514
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,668
Get around, get around up there.

515
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,218
- Come on!
- Get it!

516
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,347
Get him!

517
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,077
Somebody eat the liver. I'm on a diet.

518
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:12,793
My old woman would have used
lots of bay leaves, basil, paprika,

519
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,756
and the stuffing would have been
something very special.

520
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,550
But all things considered...

521
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,136
It was a feast. I feel like a king.

522
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,514
Ah, not bad, not bad.

523
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,434
Like I say, it's not a bad little war.

524
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,855
You never answered
my question, Josef.

525
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,607
What question?

526
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,026
What'll you do after all this is over?

527
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,779
What we'll all do. Get drunk.

528
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,240
That's the most intelligent answer
I've heard yet.

529
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,742
Of course he'll get drunk.

530
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,037
Then it's back home
and mama and all that.

531
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,372
But what else?

532
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,291
Tell him, Josef.
Don't be ashamed.

533
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,459
I'm not ashamed.

534
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,088
He's going to theology school
to be a minister.

535
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,177
A year at the front and you haven't changed
your mind about that?

536
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,638
Is God still in his heaven?

537
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,432
Nothing ever changes that.

538
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,686
- And you, Müller?
- I'm going to be an engineer.

539
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:16,231
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
I'm one of the lucky ones.

540
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,985
- Why?
- I've always known what I wanted to do.

541
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,112
Like Behm.

542
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,656
Like the farmer boy. Eh?

543
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,451
Straight back to the harvest, Detering?

544
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,079
Back to my horses and my sheep
and the harvest.

545
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,914
And my wife.

546
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,252
What will you do, Tjaden?

547
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,422
Make sure Himmelstoss doesn't
get past me.

548
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,799
I know what I want.

549
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,551
We all know what you want.

550
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,512
I want to undress every mademoiselle
from here to the Rhine.

551
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,973
We're talking about future careers, Leer.

552
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,893
I fully intend to make a career
of my lifelong hobby.

553
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,062
I'm gonna become the world's first
professor of lust.

554
01:02:57,398 --> 01:03:01,818
What about you?
Back to the cobbler's bench, yeah?

555
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:02,861
And the children.

556
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,237
How many you got?

557
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,449
Don't ask.
Good thing I'm a shoemaker,

558
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,410
or I'd go broke just buying shoes.

559
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,039
What about you, Westus?

560
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,167
A feather bed.

561
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,544
Yeah. And a fat girl.

562
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,379
I won't get up for a week!

563
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,467
The question is, what will you do
for a living?

564
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,511
Mm?

565
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,891
You know what? I think I'll stay in the army.

566
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,645
- Are you crazy?
- Well, in peace time the food's good,

567
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,607
you sleep in a bed and every week
you get clean underwear.

568
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,277
In the evenings, you're a free man,
you go off to the beer hall.

569
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,490
It's a much better life than digging peat.

570
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,325
Much better.

571
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,418
- More coffins.
- A bigger load than usual.

572
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,587
That means a bigger offensive.

573
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,136
How considerate
they are at headquarters.

574
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,264
They even send us the stuff
to fill them with.

575
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,766
Come on, get this one down.

576
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,935
Haul them up.

577
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,580
Careful, careful.

578
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,420
How old are you?

579
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,047
Sixteen.

580
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,676
Next year, right out of the cradle.

581
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:02,188
- Did you notch this bayonet?
- Yes, sir.

582
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,025
Who told you to?

583
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:08,528
- At the training camp...
- Training camp, eh?

584
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:13,658
Sonny, if the enemy ever caught you
with this, they wouldn't kill you,

585
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,329
they'd plump your eyes out
and fill them full of sawdust.

586
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,831
Nobody uses these things any more.

587
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,001
It's by mutual agreement,
on both sides.

588
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,586
I didn't know.

589
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,922
- First time at the front?
- Yes, sir.

590
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,591
Don't "sir" me. I'm a private.

591
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,217
Sorry, I thought...

592
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,386
Don't think. Just listen.

593
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,680
Yes, sir.

594
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,184
Your spade is better.

595
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,812
You hit a man under the chin,
you can take his head off.

596
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,357
It's a good club, too.

597
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,484
Cos it's heavy.

598
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:52,697
Hit a man between neck and shoulder.
Right here. Split him right in two.

599
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,699
- Mother of God!
- It's cleaner.

600
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:58,995
Bayonet gets stuck in ribs,
you have to kick him to pull it out.

601
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,124
Time it takes, you're a dead man.

602
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,169
Understand?

603
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:12,550
Now, where is your platoon leader?

604
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,594
Corporal Himmelstoss
said he would meet us here.

605
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,846
Ah.

606
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,223
Corporal who?

607
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,183
Himmelstoss.

608
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,310
- From Oldenberg training station?
- Yes, sir.

609
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,854
I don't believe it!

610
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:28,024
Vengeance is mine!

611
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:32,320
How did he mess up his playground?
He didn't volunteer for the front?

612
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,656
No, sir. He got into trouble.

613
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:39,285
Overdid it with a couple of trainees on the
muddy field. You know the muddy field?

614
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,664
Do we know the muddy field?

615
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,750
He went too far. He almost killed them.

616
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,795
And he didn't know the son
of the local magistrate was watching.

617
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,923
So they sent him up here. Wouldn't you
know he'd spoil it for himself?

618
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,093
Wouldn't you know
he'd go just too far?

619
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,930
Oh, Lord. I can hardly wait.

620
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,101
Oh, well. Look who's here.

621
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,276
Out of the way!

622
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,367
Well, we meet again.

623
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:26,541
Kropp, isn't it? You remember me,
Corporal Himmelstoss.

624
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:30,545
Müller, you here too?
Oh, yes, I remember you very well.

625
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:37,260
Leer, Behm, Baumer... Baumer.

626
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,639
Nothing wrong with my memory!

627
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,896
Well, I told you that what I taught you,
you'd never forget.

628
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,315
I see you've all managed
to stay alive.

629
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,984
Not Kemmerich.

630
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,321
Kemmerich?
I don't remember Kemmerich.

631
01:07:57,364 --> 01:08:00,492
The rest of you seem to have learned
your lessons pretty well.

632
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:04,370
Here's your lesson, Himmelstoss.
When you get to the front,

633
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,414
don't you turn your back.

634
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,001
What did you say?

635
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,838
So this is the great
Corporal Himmelstoss?

636
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,342
And who are you?

637
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,177
I asked you a question, soldier.

638
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:26,351
Himmelstoss.
There's a latrine down the road.

639
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,688
Why don't you take a jump?

640
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,774
Do you realise that
I'm your superior officer?

641
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,943
Do you want to be court martialled?

642
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,531
Stand up straight, heels together,

643
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,033
when your superior officer
speaks to you.

644
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:49,374
All of you!

645
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,585
Squad, attention!

646
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,757
Right... face.

647
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:02,637
Right turn, forward... march.

648
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,724
Left, left, left, left.

649
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:10,687
Left, left,
left, left, left, left.

650
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,126
They are being good to us.
They brought us delicious edamer cheese.

651
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:37,422
We eat and drink of course
but there is no joy in it

652
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:41,259
because they always feed us like this
before they send us into hell.

653
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,137
Kat has lost his fun.

654
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,473
When he smells cheese
he also smells trouble

655
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,601
and of course it comes.

656
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:58,109
Easy, boy, easy.
It'll be all right.

657
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:25,303
Ah, you see the way he blows up?
Boom, like that.

658
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,141
Want to kill Frenchmen?

659
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:34,312
Hey, give me the tin when you finish.
I can use the fat to polish my boots.

660
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,921
You'll be all right, boy.

661
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,839
You'll get used to it.

662
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,551
They always shell us like this
before a big offensive.

663
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,513
To soften us up so we can't sleep.

664
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,598
Huh, then when they attack,

665
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,102
we won't be able to fight back
because we're too tired.

666
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:19,357
Two days and nights. How much longer?

667
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,193
Not too long, not too long.

668
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,487
Why don't they stop?

669
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,924
Where are you going?

670
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,884
I'll be back... in a minute.

671
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:51,389
No, just relax. Wait. It'll be over soon.
Come on, sit down and relax.

672
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:58,062
Let me go. I must get away. I must go!

673
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,905
Sit down and calm down.

674
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:11,743
Now, go and sit down.
Behave yourselves. Be easy, quiet.

675
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,412
Listen...

676
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:16,873
Attack!

677
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:27,008
Come on, let's go.
Come on... Come on!

678
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:45,193
No longer do we lie helpless,
awaiting destruction.

679
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:50,114
We can destroy and kill
to save ourselves and to be revenged.

680
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:56,287
When we see their faces,
we become wild beasts.

681
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,664
We turn into thugs and murderers.

682
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,125
Into God only knows what devils.

683
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,503
If your own father was with them,

684
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,547
you wouldn't hesitate
to fling a bomb into him.

685
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,222
Forward!

686
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,446
What the hell is this?

687
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,115
Come on, let's go. Come on, you all.

688
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,409
Come on. You too, soldier.

689
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:21,581
Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go!
Damn it, let's go!

690
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:23,332
What's happening down there?

691
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,377
Come on!

692
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:31,591
Charge! Come on!

693
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:38,306
How long is it? Days,
and weeks, and months, and years.

694
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,059
Attack, counter-attack.
And the dead pile up.

695
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:47,732
Winter, summer... The days are hot
and the dead lie unburied.

696
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,650
The shells will bury them.

697
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:53,237
But when the wind blows,
it brings the smell of blood,

698
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,656
which is heavy and sweet.

699
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,629
No, shh... shh...

700
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:47,716
Shh! Shh!

701
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,593
No, no...

702
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:55,099
No, shh. Aider. Je vous...

703
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,936
Je vous... help...
I want to help you.

704
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:55,159
Ohh!

705
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,012
I didn't want to kill you.

706
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:21,185
But you jumped in here like that.

707
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:27,107
What would you have done? It's...

708
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:32,529
It's just I'd never met you
before... like this...

709
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:36,200
face to face.

710
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,747
I just saw your rifle...

711
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,918
your bayonet...

712
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:49,713
grenades.

713
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,928
If we threw all those away...

714
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,891
we could be brothers.

715
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:07,815
But they never want us
to know that, do they?

716
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,070
They never want us to know.

717
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,950
We each have mothers...

718
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,370
fathers...

719
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,749
the same...

720
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,169
fear of death.

721
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,465
The same...

722
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,719
pain.

723
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:40,097
The same...

724
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,309
everything.

725
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,773
Everything.

726
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,035
Forgive me, comrade.

727
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,886
I could write... to your family.

728
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:23,515
Yes...

729
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,350
Yes, I'll write!

730
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:51,752
"Gerard Duval, compositeur."

731
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:56,173
I have killed
Gerard Duval the printer.

732
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,738
Battalion, attention!

733
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,744
Present arms!

734
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,627
Eyes left!

735
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,950
Battalion Commander, sir.

736
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:31,453
Your Majesty, I have the honour
to bring you the salute

737
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:34,331
of the 150th Infantry Battalion.

738
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,476
Your Majesty, Soldier Bernard.

739
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:12,369
Your Majesty, Soldier Langer.

740
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,850
Your Majesty, Corporal Himmelstoss.

741
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,033
Battalion! At ease!

742
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:57,748
Officers, non-commissioned officers,
enlisted men.

743
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,710
The men who have received
decorations this day

744
01:29:01,878 --> 01:29:05,922
have all performed actions
worthy of our great cause.

745
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:10,469
Henceforth, Germany expects
each of you to follow their example.

746
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:17,059
From this day on, your Kaiser urges
you all to aspire to such strength,

747
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:23,857
to such bravery, to such obedience
to your God and your country.

748
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,943
If you do, my soldiers,

749
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:31,448
I am certain that every one of you
will one day wear a medal

750
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,076
pinned on you by your Kaiser.

751
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,913
You have all done your duty in the noble
tradition of the German warrior.

752
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:41,875
You have shown the world our might.

753
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,837
You have stricken
our enemies with fear.

754
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:51,802
With God's help, you are winning
a glorious victory for the Fatherland.

755
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,266
The Kaiser! Just wait till I tell my father.

756
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:00,811
Oh, yeah? What'll you tell him?

757
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:03,105
I'll tell him I saw the Kaiser!

758
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,232
Up this close - he's never gonna believe it.

759
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,485
- He seemed like a very nice man.
- Yeah, really nice.

760
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:11,154
Do you think it's true
they forced him into this war?

761
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:13,615
- I wouldn't say that.
- Why not?

762
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:16,284
It's the generals' fault, he had to say yes.

763
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:19,871
- So the generals started the war?
- The French generals, yes.

764
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:22,999
The French generals told the Kaiser
we had to have a war?

765
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,001
No, you don't understand...

766
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:27,379
Be careful with these uniforms, boys.

767
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,798
They have to be handed down to the next
bunch of heroes

768
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,591
that gets reviewed by the Kaiser.

769
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:34,428
Kat, why do you think we're in this war?

770
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,515
- Protect the Fatherland.
- What are the French fighting for?

771
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,350
Protect the Motherland.

772
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,018
And who's right?

773
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,229
Whoever wins.

774
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,731
That's not very patriotic.

775
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:50,193
- Not very what?
- Patriotic.

776
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:56,199
Maybe not. Maybe it's not very patriotic
to use your head.

777
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:59,536
Maybe the real patriot just goes out
and gets his head blown off.

778
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,414
- And gets a medal for it.
- Like Himmelstoss?

779
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,708
Can you imagine that little peacock
getting a medal?

780
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,251
From the Kaiser?

781
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,295
Be fair, he deserved it.

782
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:12,215
He behaved like a true German soldier.

783
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:15,093
He ran ahead when he was told
to run ahead

784
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:17,512
and he ran back
when he was told to run back.

785
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:22,642
The only thing he didn't do
like a German soldier... was die.

786
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,356
Do you think that's what we're fighting for?
Just to die?

787
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:32,819
Well, do you know what we're fighting for?

788
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:36,031
Does anybody know what we're fighting for?

789
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:38,241
Does the Kaiser?

790
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:41,912
Maybe if he'd stayed out of it in the first
place there'd be no war.

791
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:43,914
Corporal.

792
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,459
Come in.

793
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:00,138
Sit down.

794
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:10,524
Listen, their country insulted ours -
that's how it started.

795
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:14,861
"Their country insulted ours"?
I don't understand.

796
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,156
A mountain in France
insulted a mountain Germany?

797
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:20,408
Ah, you know what I mean.

798
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:26,540
- One country offended the other.
- Then what am I doing here?

799
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:27,832
I haven't been offended.

800
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,795
How could I be offended?
I've never even been to France before.

801
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,090
In all my life I've only known
a handful of Frenchies.

802
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:38,468
They seemed all right to me.
Human, people.

803
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,805
Let me tell you, the only reason
we're fighting this war

804
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,099
is because it's useful to somebody.

805
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:46,476
Hm? But who?

806
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,103
Not for me.

807
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:51,147
Let me tell you something else -
about those generals.

808
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:53,358
They're getting something out of all this too.

809
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:54,693
What do they get?

810
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,653
Famous!

811
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,948
Hey, anybody ever heard of Vitry-les-Bois?

812
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:01,324
It's a French pastry!

813
01:33:01,492 --> 01:33:04,494
It's an occupied French village
and we're all going there.

814
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:07,497
- What for?
- For seven days' leave!

815
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:21,469
Ever seen anything
as beautiful as that.

816
01:33:21,637 --> 01:33:24,139
Never.

817
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,349
How old would you say she is?

818
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:27,767
21, 22.

819
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:31,271
Oh, no. I don't think she'd be older than us.

820
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:34,608
I'd say... 17 at the most.

821
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:37,277
Oh, she's so clean.

822
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,280
Why not? I bet she take a bath
every single day.

823
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,199
Mm, twice. Three times a day.

824
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:45,327
There's no dirt under those fingernails.

825
01:33:47,204 --> 01:33:50,373
How far do you suppose he could march
with shoes like that?

826
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,461
- Do you remember white trousers?
- Do I!

827
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,297
I have a pair like that at home.

828
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:28,453
It would be nice, wouldn't it, Albert?

829
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:34,250
Maybe we could go over
to the de-lousing station.

830
01:34:34,418 --> 01:34:36,586
Why? You'll be covered again
in half an hour.

831
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,046
I just feel so dirty.

832
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,757
Hey! Get your hands off her, she's mine!

833
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,426
Oh my!

834
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:49,057
What are these filthy-minded Krauts
been saying, sweetheart?

835
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:52,644
Come on, shutzy, throw a little my way.

836
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:56,147
You know, she looks a lot like
the first one I ever had.

837
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:57,857
Olga.

838
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:00,944
Olga, my little peasant calf.

839
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,446
Come on, you never had anything like that.

840
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:05,824
Oh no?

841
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,494
See you later.

842
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,538
- Where are you going?
- Sightseeing.

843
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,581
What's wrong with this sight?

844
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,801
It'll take six weeks to get to the skin!

845
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:28,221
- Can I have a piece of that soap?
- How's the water?

846
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,932
Beautiful! Come on in!

847
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,684
Hey! Look at that!

848
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:43,319
- Hello! Bonjour, bonjour!
- Jolies! Jolies!

849
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:46,656
Somebody do something!
Just don't let them get away!

850
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:51,161
Allo, Mademoiselles!
Allo, Mademoiselles!

851
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:54,372
Ami! Ami, mademoiselles!

852
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,333
Une minute, madame!

853
01:35:57,501 --> 01:36:00,628
- Attendez, s'il vous plait!
- Tell them to come over.

854
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:05,884
Er, yes, er... Mademoiselle,
you come over this side, oui?

855
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,428
Vous venez, s'il vous plaît.

856
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:12,724
- Ask them what they're doing tonight.
- Don't let them get away!

857
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,853
Er, nous vivons à vous parler,
all right?

858
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:23,193
- Tell 'em we want to talk.
- Talk?!

859
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,196
- Parlez vous, Mesdemoiselles!
- Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

860
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:28,907
Tell them... Mademoiselles!

861
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:32,368
Venez assi!

862
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:34,370
No, that's not it, it's venez ici.

863
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:37,123
Frauleins, I'amour, yes?

864
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:40,084
You coming over,
we have I'amour, yes?

865
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:42,712
Oui, oui, oui.

866
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,840
- Don't go!
- Yoo-hoo!

867
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:50,261
Girls! Fraulein, bread, yes?
You want bread?

868
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:53,223
Look! Regardez!

869
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,559
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum, yes? Bread!

870
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:59,145
You come over here, oui?

871
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:01,356
Vous!

872
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,024
Venez!

873
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,234
Ici!

874
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:07,070
Maintenant!

875
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,196
Oui! Oui!

876
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:10,406
- What did she say?
- They want us to come over. No...

877
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:12,826
- Pas possible!
- No, we can't!

878
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,621
We can't! There's guards, sentries,
you understand? Watch.

879
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:19,290
We can't, they're up there.

880
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:25,588
Ce soir!

881
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,757
Vous venez!

882
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:30,343
Lá-bas!

883
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,803
Nôtre maison!

884
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:35,598
They want us to come
to their house tonight!

885
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:39,018
Oui! Avec quelque chose à manger, oui?

886
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:42,730
- With something to eat!
- La maison là!

887
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:44,607
Maison!

888
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:48,403
- Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!
- Bye! Bye!

889
01:37:59,164 --> 01:38:00,999
Drink up, Tjaden.

890
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:12,135
It's bad luck there's four of us
and three of them.

891
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,762
Mm-hmm... Bad luck.

892
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:18,474
See, I just don't think it's fair to the girls.

893
01:38:19,518 --> 01:38:22,645
Drink up, Tjaden. How often
do you get good French wine?

894
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:27,442
Not fair to the girls... No.

895
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,821
One of us will have to make
the supreme sacrifice.

896
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,781
Mmm?

897
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:37,160
Bottoms up, Tjaden,
you're not keeping up with us.

898
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,708
Maybe we should draw lots?

899
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:48,838
You lose.

900
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,694
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

901
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:43,870
This looks like
the right line-up, huh?

902
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:47,040
I'm all for this one.

903
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:49,625
You like yours, Albert?

904
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:51,002
Yes.

905
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,171
Paul?

906
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:36,547
Mais tu es blanc comme neige, toi.

907
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:38,341
Er...

908
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:42,678
Est-ce que je me trompe,
petit bon homme?

909
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:44,514
Oui!

910
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,320
Mon petit soldat.

911
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,616
Viens. Viens.

912
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,332
Non, non. Ici.

913
01:43:06,096 --> 01:43:08,222
- Quelle âge as tu?
- Eh?

914
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:10,266
- Ton âge?
- No...

915
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:13,686
- Quelle âge as tu?
- Ah! I'm nineteen.

916
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,315
Nineteen.

917
01:43:17,482 --> 01:43:19,483
Nineteen... Oh!

918
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:31,454
Vingt-cinq ans? Vraiment?
Tu exaggeres, non?

919
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:11,661
The room grows dim
and dissolves in the half-light

920
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:15,539
and only the face near mine lives
and is clear.

921
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:19,710
The face is touched with a tenderness
that comes out of the night...

922
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:23,256
and I let it all fall from me.

923
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:26,175
War and terror,

924
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:28,177
and grossness,

925
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:32,014
in order to awaken young and happy.

926
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:57,707
Look out! Look out! Take cover!

927
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:07,109
Come on! Come on, Albert!

928
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:19,705
- My leg!
- Come on, Albert! Up! Up!

929
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:28,422
Come on, boys, a little bit more.

930
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:47,942
Down! Stay down!

931
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,533
I'll be right back!

932
01:48:13,069 --> 01:48:14,778
Hey!

933
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:26,290
Easy!

934
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:38,719
Paul!

935
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:40,513
Take care!

936
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:54,902
Kat.

937
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:02,493
Kat!

938
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:04,662
Kat, come on!

939
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:14,797
- All right.
- Easy, easy.

940
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:30,479
- It's from Kat.
- What is it?

941
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:33,983
- We got a long ride. You could get hungry.
- Oh, bread and cheese!

942
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:39,446
He could find a lobster dinner
in the middle of the desert!

943
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:43,701
Goodbye.

944
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,829
- Take care, Paul.
- Bye.

945
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,921
Whistle blows)

946
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:18,527
Albert and I are in a Catholic hospital.

947
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:21,864
This is a piece of luck because Catholic
infirmaries are noted

948
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:24,491
for their good treatment and good food.

949
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:29,496
We were wheeled in the night before
and none of us slept well.

950
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,595
- Won't see him again.
- Why not?

951
01:51:27,305 --> 01:51:30,766
They've taken his clothes.
That means he's off to the Dead Room.

952
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,394
The "Dead Room"?

953
01:51:34,312 --> 01:51:35,521
What's the Dead Room?

954
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:38,565
The Dying Room,
whatever you wanna call it.

955
01:51:38,733 --> 01:51:40,943
It's in the basement.

956
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:47,116
Whenever anybody wants to say
"goodbye, life", they take 'em there.

957
01:51:47,283 --> 01:51:51,203
It's convenient really.
It's next to the mortuary.

958
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:55,624
No one ever comes back from it.

959
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:05,926
The beds empty quickly
and new occupants take their places.

960
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:11,014
It is going badly with Albert.
He is in much pain.

961
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:15,102
Last night one of our wardmates
awakened with a severe haemorrhage.

962
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:19,982
He is only semi-conscious today.
The doctors look in more often.

963
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:47,760
They won't take me! No! No!

964
01:52:48,636 --> 01:52:50,179
We're taking you
to the bandaging room.

965
01:52:50,346 --> 01:52:53,640
I won't go to the Dying Room!
Stay here! Stay here!

966
01:52:53,808 --> 01:52:56,101
We're going to the bandaging ward.

967
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:57,770
Then why are you taking his tunic?

968
01:52:57,937 --> 01:53:02,232
- I'll be back. I won't die!
- Why are you taking his tunic?

969
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,570
I'll come back!
I won't die! I'll come back!

970
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:08,113
Liars!

971
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,073
They're lying.

972
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:12,284
Liars!

973
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:20,375
I'll come back!
I'll come back! I won't die...

974
01:53:23,087 --> 01:53:26,590
I am learning to walk again
but always in the corridor.

975
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:32,221
I can't bear Albert's gaze
if I move abut the room.

976
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:38,727
He has a strange look. I know what it is
because I know Albert.

977
01:53:38,895 --> 01:53:42,564
He is bitter and jealous that I am getting
better and he is not.

978
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:47,069
And I know he has a terrible guilt
that he feels jealous of me.

979
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:48,612
I know Albert.

980
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,405
He's always been my best friend.

981
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:54,785
I get to know this hospital very well,

982
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:57,955
where they keep the abdonimal
and spinal cases,

983
01:53:58,122 --> 01:54:00,415
the head wounds and double amputations,

984
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:04,920
the jaw wounds, the tesictle wounds,
the gas cases,

985
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:06,755
the blind cases,

986
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:09,925
the lung wounds and intestinal wounds.

987
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:13,470
And this is only one hospital.
One single station.

988
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,390
There are thousands in Germany.

989
01:54:16,558 --> 01:54:20,435
How many thousands are there in France?
In Russia?

990
01:54:20,603 --> 01:54:22,771
In England?

991
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:27,234
How senseless is everything that can ever
be written, done and thought,

992
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:29,736
when such things are possible?

993
01:54:29,904 --> 01:54:33,031
The culture of a thousand years
could not prevent this stream of blood

994
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,117
being poured out.

995
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:38,078
A hospital alone shows what war is.

996
01:54:47,463 --> 01:54:49,298
Stop it!

997
01:54:49,465 --> 01:54:52,426
Stop it! Stop that! Orderly!

998
01:54:53,052 --> 01:54:54,636
Get the orderly! Doctor!

999
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:57,139
Orderly! Orderly!

1000
01:54:57,807 --> 01:55:00,517
He's trying to kill himself
with a fork!

1001
01:55:17,994 --> 01:55:20,662
Why didn't you leave him alone?

1002
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:38,138
You are doing so well, Paul.

1003
01:55:38,306 --> 01:55:40,849
Soon we'll throw away the cane.

1004
01:55:45,688 --> 01:55:48,357
- Sister.
- Yes?

1005
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:51,526
I'm worried about my friend.

1006
01:55:52,862 --> 01:55:56,865
I think... he is making
a very good recovery.

1007
01:55:58,034 --> 01:55:59,952
He worries me.

1008
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:02,371
Since the operation, he...

1009
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:07,042
He's in a terrible state of mind.
He hardly speaks to me any more.

1010
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:12,965
There is always such a reaction
after an amputation.

1011
01:56:13,841 --> 01:56:15,759
Always!

1012
01:56:15,927 --> 01:56:18,387
Now, stop worrying.

1013
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:21,348
Albert will get over it.

1014
01:56:21,516 --> 01:56:24,059
Go, tell him your good news.

1015
01:56:24,894 --> 01:56:26,979
That should cheer him up.

1016
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:44,830
Albert?

1017
01:56:45,456 --> 01:56:47,332
How do you feel?

1018
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:07,477
Albert, they're giving me 16 days'
convalescent leave.

1019
01:57:07,645 --> 01:57:08,854
I'll be going home.

1020
01:57:11,482 --> 01:57:14,735
They'll be sending you home, too.
Very soon.

1021
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:19,281
Baumer! Hey, Baumer.
It's me, I'm back.

1022
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:23,160
- Franz!
- Didn't I tell you I'd come back?

1023
01:57:23,327 --> 01:57:26,830
- I don't believe it.
- Death Room, Dying Room.

1024
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:30,417
What the... hell
are they talking about?

1025
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,295
Old Man Death didn't catch me.

1026
01:57:33,463 --> 01:57:35,630
I caught him out!

1027
01:57:37,925 --> 01:57:39,301
He did say he'd come back.

1028
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,138
Didn't he?

1029
01:57:44,348 --> 01:57:46,308
Albert, is there anything I can get you?

1030
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,270
A gun.

1031
01:57:53,816 --> 01:57:55,150
A what?

1032
01:57:57,945 --> 01:58:01,615
You want to get me something?
Get me a gun.

1033
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:10,499
- Are you going to get me a gun or not?
- No! Don't talk nonsense!

1034
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:14,336
No, you talk sense.

1035
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:21,593
Albert...

1036
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:26,431
I'm sorry.

1037
02:01:05,132 --> 02:01:07,008
Paul?

1038
02:01:07,176 --> 02:01:10,762
Paul! Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?

1039
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:13,473
Mother. Mother!

1040
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:35,912
Paul? Come up.

1041
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:57,142
Give me your handkerchief.

1042
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:18,621
How is she?

1043
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:22,334
She's in bed.

1044
02:02:22,501 --> 02:02:24,502
She's sick, Paul.

1045
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:27,505
What is it?

1046
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:29,966
We don't know.

1047
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:36,681
But... Dr Bradermeier thinks...
it's probably the cancer again.

1048
02:03:12,968 --> 02:03:15,053
Thank God.

1049
02:03:17,473 --> 02:03:20,016
Oh, thank God.

1050
02:03:23,104 --> 02:03:24,771
Thank God.

1051
02:03:26,816 --> 02:03:28,566
Are you wounded, Paul?

1052
02:03:30,861 --> 02:03:34,531
No... No, I'm just on leave.

1053
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:37,909
- Oh, Paul.
- How are you feeling?

1054
02:03:38,077 --> 02:03:42,747
I'm going to try to get up
a little today, I think.

1055
02:03:42,915 --> 02:03:44,791
Good.

1056
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:52,090
They must have known you were coming.
Ernst is making your favourite potato cakes.

1057
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:55,635
And there's a bottle of whortleberryjam
with them.

1058
02:03:55,803 --> 02:03:59,431
- You like that, don't you?
- Yes, I haven't had any for a long time.

1059
02:04:00,975 --> 02:04:02,559
Where's Father?

1060
02:04:04,478 --> 02:04:06,729
At the sulphur factory.

1061
02:04:06,897 --> 02:04:08,565
He's working overtime.

1062
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:20,034
My Paul.

1063
02:04:21,954 --> 02:04:23,288
Look.

1064
02:04:28,377 --> 02:04:30,128
Bread.

1065
02:04:30,921 --> 02:04:34,966
And cheese and... butter!

1066
02:04:36,886 --> 02:04:40,555
They feed you enough where you are?

1067
02:04:40,723 --> 02:04:42,765
Not always enough, but we manage.

1068
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,394
Is it very bad there?

1069
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:49,647
No.

1070
02:04:49,815 --> 02:04:51,816
Not so bad.

1071
02:04:53,068 --> 02:04:54,944
Heinrich Bradermeier was here

1072
02:04:55,112 --> 02:05:00,909
and said it's terrible out there,
with the gas attacks

1073
02:05:01,076 --> 02:05:03,119
and all the rest of it.

1074
02:05:03,287 --> 02:05:04,829
It's just talk.

1075
02:05:04,997 --> 02:05:06,915
Just talk.

1076
02:05:07,082 --> 02:05:10,502
Look at me, I'm well and fit,

1077
02:05:10,669 --> 02:05:12,003
aren't I?

1078
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,341
Yes.

1079
02:05:22,932 --> 02:05:24,933
But then...

1080
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,814
I still don't understand why you want
to take off your uniform.

1081
02:05:31,982 --> 02:05:35,360
It's just more comfortable,
Father, that's all.

1082
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:38,530
But I... I want to show off
our soldier boy

1083
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:40,740
to the fellows at Max's.

1084
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:59,509
You look well, Paul. Fit.
War agrees with you, eh?

1085
02:06:01,178 --> 02:06:02,929
I suppose, in a way.

1086
02:06:03,097 --> 02:06:04,305
- Have a cigar.
- No, thank you.

1087
02:06:04,473 --> 02:06:08,601
If you're old enough to kill Frenchmen,
you're old enough to smoke.

1088
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,438
Hans, another beer
for our young warrior.

1089
02:06:12,606 --> 02:06:15,608
What's the spirit like out there?
Excellent, eh?

1090
02:06:16,527 --> 02:06:20,029
I can believe it. The thing to do now
is finish off the Froggies.

1091
02:06:20,197 --> 02:06:23,700
The enemy has many reserves,
Mr. Hollerstein.

1092
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:26,953
The war may be different
from what people think.

1093
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:29,872
You only see your little sector,

1094
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,959
sometimes you lose sight
of the large picture.

1095
02:06:33,127 --> 02:06:39,632
The important thing as I see it is
the breakthrough, here in Flanders.

1096
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,509
This is Frenchie, this is us.

1097
02:06:41,677 --> 02:06:46,639
We have to come round the Belgian side
and ram through.

1098
02:06:46,807 --> 02:06:48,099
There's no other way.

1099
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:52,186
How can we do that before we beat them
on the Hindenburg line?

1100
02:06:52,354 --> 02:06:54,981
It is borders that are important.

1101
02:06:55,149 --> 02:06:59,360
You're quite wrong. A good soldier never
stays planted on a border like a turnip.

1102
02:06:59,528 --> 02:07:01,779
- He advances.
- I agree with Ludwig.

1103
02:07:01,947 --> 02:07:05,700
Offence is the key to modern warfare.
Look what happened in 1870.

1104
02:07:05,868 --> 02:07:11,789
Nonsense. We're talking about modern
warfare, not what happened 50 years ago.

1105
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:18,379
You're lying to me, Paul.
I know that you are.

1106
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:21,966
I swear to you, he died instantly.

1107
02:07:23,761 --> 02:07:26,763
- You promised me he wouldn't get hurt.
- Mrs. Kemmerich, I...

1108
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:30,892
Why are you living
when he is dead? Why?

1109
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:33,227
What right have you?

1110
02:07:51,955 --> 02:07:54,332
Tell me again.

1111
02:07:56,543 --> 02:07:58,753
Did you... see it?

1112
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:02,590
Yes, I was right there next to him.

1113
02:08:03,592 --> 02:08:06,260
He died at once. He never suffered.

1114
02:08:11,183 --> 02:08:15,853
I know that
you're trying to comfort me,

1115
02:08:16,021 --> 02:08:20,942
but don't you see it is harder this way
than if you told the truth?

1116
02:08:23,612 --> 02:08:25,113
I want to know the...

1117
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,574
I want the truth!

1118
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:32,787
I have to hear it!

1119
02:08:35,124 --> 02:08:38,793
Mrs. Kemmerich, I promise you,
that's exactly how it happened.

1120
02:08:39,294 --> 02:08:43,673
He died immediately.
He felt absolutely nothing at all.

1121
02:08:45,592 --> 02:08:47,260
His face was quite calm.

1122
02:08:48,762 --> 02:08:51,180
- Do you swear it?
- Yes.

1123
02:08:52,975 --> 02:08:55,768
By everything that is sacred to you?

1124
02:09:03,485 --> 02:09:06,070
By everything that is sacred to me.

1125
02:09:07,114 --> 02:09:08,448
He died at once.

1126
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:15,371
And do you promise never
to come back... if it is not true?

1127
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,676
May I never come back...

1128
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:32,180
if he wasn't killed instantly.

1129
02:09:39,021 --> 02:09:40,980
Carry that lesson to the front lines

1130
02:09:41,148 --> 02:09:45,109
and you will be better soldiers
in the service of the Kaiser.

1131
02:09:46,945 --> 02:09:48,696
You are dismissed.

1132
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:13,179
Baumer.

1133
02:10:16,308 --> 02:10:18,226
Paul Baumer!

1134
02:10:20,562 --> 02:10:22,438
Baumer!

1135
02:10:24,024 --> 02:10:27,401
- Here, have a cigarette.
- No, thank you.

1136
02:10:27,569 --> 02:10:30,780
You still haven't picked up the habit.
Well, that's good.

1137
02:10:30,948 --> 02:10:36,077
It's not a good habit
but a man has to have some vices.

1138
02:10:36,245 --> 02:10:39,831
How does it go? All work
and no play... You remember?

1139
02:10:39,998 --> 02:10:42,250
Yes...

1140
02:10:42,417 --> 02:10:47,046
How is it, Baumer?
How... how is the spirit?

1141
02:10:47,923 --> 02:10:49,423
Excellent, eh? Excellent?

1142
02:10:51,218 --> 02:10:53,135
Behm is dead.

1143
02:10:53,303 --> 02:10:54,929
Behm?

1144
02:10:55,097 --> 02:10:56,681
Josef Behm.

1145
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:59,934
Oh. You know,
I didn't think he would enlist.

1146
02:11:00,978 --> 02:11:02,645
But he went.

1147
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:05,439
Yes...

1148
02:11:05,607 --> 02:11:08,067
Kemmerich is dead, too.

1149
02:11:08,235 --> 02:11:09,735
I was told.

1150
02:11:09,903 --> 02:11:12,488
And Kropp has lost a leg.

1151
02:11:13,323 --> 02:11:15,950
Er... Oh, Albert Kropp, yes.

1152
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:23,124
I don't know about all the others.
We were separated, but Leer's alive

1153
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:26,168
and Müller is alive and I'm alive.

1154
02:11:27,212 --> 02:11:28,880
I'm glad to hear that.

1155
02:11:30,966 --> 02:11:33,301
Tell them...

1156
02:11:33,468 --> 02:11:38,973
Tell them I'm proud to have
taught them to be good Germans.

1157
02:11:40,309 --> 02:11:44,937
To know that you have all
done your duty by the Fatherland.

1158
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:50,109
Can you imagine how that makes me feel?

1159
02:11:51,653 --> 02:11:54,822
You were a good class. Good boys.

1160
02:11:55,824 --> 02:11:58,326
Good boys all.

1161
02:11:58,493 --> 02:12:01,329
- And this class?
- This lot?

1162
02:12:01,496 --> 02:12:06,334
Not like you. Defeatism,
it has infected them.

1163
02:12:08,086 --> 02:12:10,296
They haven't got your spirit, Baumer.

1164
02:12:11,256 --> 02:12:13,341
Not the Iron Youth, eh?

1165
02:12:13,508 --> 02:12:14,717
Mm? I'm sorry...?

1166
02:12:14,885 --> 02:12:16,886
No Iron Heroes?

1167
02:12:17,596 --> 02:12:19,513
Just boys.

1168
02:12:20,182 --> 02:12:22,099
Want to play.

1169
02:12:22,267 --> 02:12:24,101
Laugh.

1170
02:12:24,895 --> 02:12:26,228
To stay alive.

1171
02:12:29,733 --> 02:12:31,734
Only boys.

1172
02:13:15,153 --> 02:13:17,863
Mother, it's late.
You should be asleep.

1173
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:20,658
Did I wake you, dear? I'm sorry.

1174
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:23,411
You'll catch cold here. Go, sleep.

1175
02:13:24,454 --> 02:13:26,163
I can sleep enough later.

1176
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:30,584
Are you very much afraid?

1177
02:13:33,255 --> 02:13:34,547
No.

1178
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:40,594
I'd like to tell you to be on your guard
against the women in France.

1179
02:13:40,762 --> 02:13:42,555
They're no good.

1180
02:13:44,766 --> 02:13:49,103
Mother, where we are
there aren't any women.

1181
02:13:49,271 --> 02:13:52,773
And be very careful
at the front, Paul.

1182
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:57,319
- Yes, I will.
- I pray for you every day.

1183
02:13:58,363 --> 02:14:00,364
I know, Mother.

1184
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:05,786
Perhaps you can get a job
that is not so dangerous?

1185
02:14:07,122 --> 02:14:10,458
Yes, perhaps in the cookhouse.
That could be easily done.

1186
02:14:10,959 --> 02:14:14,295
You do it, then,
and if the others say anything...

1187
02:14:14,463 --> 02:14:16,338
I won't let that bother me.

1188
02:14:16,506 --> 02:14:21,469
Now, you must go to sleep, Mother.
Come on.

1189
02:14:51,625 --> 02:14:55,377
You must get well, Mother,
before I come home.

1190
02:14:56,463 --> 02:14:58,506
Yes, my child.

1191
02:14:59,758 --> 02:15:03,928
And you must not send any more things
to me. We get plenty to eat out there.

1192
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:07,515
You can make much better use
of them here.

1193
02:15:19,653 --> 02:15:22,696
Oh, I have two pair of underpants for you.

1194
02:15:22,864 --> 02:15:24,865
All wool.

1195
02:15:26,535 --> 02:15:28,869
They will keep you warm.

1196
02:15:29,037 --> 02:15:31,497
You must not forget to put them
in your bag.

1197
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:35,209
I won't, Mother.

1198
02:15:35,377 --> 02:15:40,005
Good night.

1199
02:15:40,173 --> 02:15:41,882
My son.

1200
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:25,402
Mother, I used to live in this room.
All my things are here.

1201
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:28,948
All my books, my beloved books,

1202
02:17:29,115 --> 02:17:32,117
but they no longer speak to me
as they used to,

1203
02:17:32,285 --> 02:17:35,746
for I am not what I was
when I lived in this room.

1204
02:17:36,581 --> 02:17:41,961
I am a soldier. My business
is not reading, it is killing.

1205
02:17:42,128 --> 02:17:45,130
My knowledge of life is limited to death,

1206
02:17:45,298 --> 02:17:48,175
and I know now
I should never have come back.

1207
02:17:49,219 --> 02:17:51,637
Out there, all men think as I do.

1208
02:17:51,805 --> 02:17:53,806
There's no argument
about the meaning of life,

1209
02:17:53,974 --> 02:17:56,100
because it has no meaning.

1210
02:17:56,268 --> 02:18:00,104
My companions at the front
are the only truth I know.

1211
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:04,108
They are now my books,
my family, my life.

1212
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:08,153
I depend on them
and I depend on nothing else.

1213
02:18:09,406 --> 02:18:12,866
Mother, it's a terrible thing to say,

1214
02:18:13,868 --> 02:18:16,704
but I feel I am now going back
to my real home.

1215
02:18:36,266 --> 02:18:37,474
Paul!

1216
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:52,740
- Well, you're back, my boy.
- Yes, I'm back.

1217
02:18:56,036 --> 02:18:59,413
You're a fool for coming back.
I'm glad to see you, anyway.

1218
02:18:59,581 --> 02:19:01,874
I'm glad to see you, too, Kat.

1219
02:19:05,253 --> 02:19:07,880
They're getting
younger and younger, Paul.

1220
02:19:11,593 --> 02:19:14,720
Our hands'll be full
just taking care of them.

1221
02:19:23,772 --> 02:19:26,565
Hey! The old deserter's back!

1222
02:19:29,611 --> 02:19:32,029
- How was your leave?
- Good. Where's Müller?

1223
02:19:38,286 --> 02:19:41,246
- When was it?
- A week ago.

1224
02:19:45,752 --> 02:19:47,795
Was it quick?

1225
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:55,803
Shrapnel in the stomach.
He lasted two hours.

1226
02:20:00,141 --> 02:20:02,059
Paul...

1227
02:20:03,812 --> 02:20:05,813
He said I could have them.

1228
02:20:20,328 --> 02:20:21,995
Damn!

1229
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:33,173
If they come any closer,
we're done for.

1230
02:20:42,183 --> 02:21:13,797
Lieutenant!

1231
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:17,885
Leer! No, leave him!
He's gone! He's gone!

1232
02:21:18,052 --> 02:21:20,053
Leer! Come back!

1233
02:21:36,863 --> 02:21:38,197
God!

1234
02:21:38,823 --> 02:21:42,075
Oh, God! God! God! God!

1235
02:22:31,417 --> 02:22:33,502
- Ready! Charge!
- Let's go!

1236
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:58,819
We are bringing food
to our comrades at the front.

1237
02:22:58,987 --> 02:23:03,448
There isn't much. We are all
going hungry. We are all tired.

1238
02:23:03,616 --> 02:23:07,494
We are all hopeless.
But the war goes on.

1239
02:23:10,748 --> 02:23:12,457
Why don't theyjust let it end?

1240
02:23:12,625 --> 02:23:14,543
Ah, who knows?

1241
02:23:17,755 --> 02:23:19,506
We're finished.

1242
02:23:19,674 --> 02:23:24,344
We're starving, and the Froggies
are eating corned beef and white bread.

1243
02:23:25,763 --> 02:23:27,681
Our bread is nothing but sawdust.

1244
02:23:30,518 --> 02:23:33,854
You see anybody that hasn't got
dysentery and colic?

1245
02:23:35,565 --> 02:23:37,232
Artillery's burned out.

1246
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:41,403
Damned barrels are so worn down... Ha!

1247
02:23:41,571 --> 02:23:45,699
...the shells are falling short
and half the time our men are being killed.

1248
02:23:45,867 --> 02:23:50,662
There's just too many of the enemy left.
They've got too much.

1249
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:54,541
Too many guns, tanks.
Now the Americans are pouring in.

1250
02:23:56,252 --> 02:24:00,380
New guns, aeroplanes, fresh troops.

1251
02:24:18,733 --> 02:24:20,400
Lie still.

1252
02:24:21,235 --> 02:24:23,987
- Just as it's ending!
- Be quiet!

1253
02:24:24,155 --> 02:24:27,366
- After four years.
- Stretcher!

1254
02:24:27,950 --> 02:24:30,577
- Stretcher bearer!
- Just as it's ending.

1255
02:24:32,580 --> 02:24:34,081
It's all right. Just lie still.

1256
02:24:34,248 --> 02:24:37,417
Don't worry,
it looks like a clean wound.

1257
02:24:38,294 --> 02:24:40,545
If you can just hold on.

1258
02:24:40,713 --> 02:24:44,424
Before you know it you'll be
in a comfortable bed in a hospital.

1259
02:24:45,426 --> 02:24:47,260
Stretcher!

1260
02:24:47,428 --> 02:24:48,637
Think you can stand up?

1261
02:24:49,931 --> 02:24:50,931
Think you can get up?

1262
02:24:52,266 --> 02:24:55,268
Come on. Come on! Come on!

1263
02:25:03,945 --> 02:25:05,612
I've got to carry you.

1264
02:25:06,656 --> 02:25:08,532
Ready? Up.

1265
02:25:31,639 --> 02:25:32,514
I'm sorry.

1266
02:25:32,682 --> 02:25:35,350
That's all right, Paul. That's all right.

1267
02:25:45,027 --> 02:25:48,071
We gotta keep going. You ready?

1268
02:25:48,239 --> 02:25:49,823
Yes, yes.

1269
02:25:51,743 --> 02:25:53,493
Come on.

1270
02:25:57,498 --> 02:25:59,666
- You got it?
- I'll try.

1271
02:26:04,505 --> 02:26:05,672
- No.
- No, I'll try.

1272
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,258
No, you can't. It's all right.

1273
02:26:41,626 --> 02:26:44,044
- What is it?
- My pipe.

1274
02:26:44,837 --> 02:26:46,630
I think I've lost my pipe.

1275
02:26:46,798 --> 02:26:48,465
Don't worry.

1276
02:26:48,633 --> 02:26:50,467
We'll find another one.

1277
02:26:51,511 --> 02:26:53,595
Here.

1278
02:27:09,445 --> 02:27:11,822
Well, Kat...

1279
02:27:13,115 --> 02:27:15,242
I think we're gonna be separated.

1280
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:19,412
Three years.

1281
02:27:22,792 --> 02:27:25,085
You remember when I first came up here?

1282
02:27:25,753 --> 02:27:27,921
How green I was?

1283
02:27:29,465 --> 02:27:32,592
You fixed that. "Keep your head down."

1284
02:27:33,636 --> 02:27:35,387
That's what you said.

1285
02:27:39,892 --> 02:27:44,771
Maybe... Maybe, when this is over,

1286
02:27:45,606 --> 02:27:49,276
when this war is really finished,

1287
02:27:49,443 --> 02:27:52,821
maybe we can do something together. Huh?

1288
02:27:52,989 --> 02:27:55,031
I don't know what.

1289
02:27:56,325 --> 02:27:57,909
Glass of wine.

1290
02:28:00,955 --> 02:28:03,039
I don't even know where you live.

1291
02:28:03,666 --> 02:28:07,627
Three years in the same trenches,
I don't even have your address.

1292
02:28:08,004 --> 02:28:10,881
Let me give you mine. Let me give it to you.

1293
02:28:13,759 --> 02:28:15,135
Let's...

1294
02:28:16,137 --> 02:28:17,971
Let's go on.

1295
02:28:20,182 --> 02:28:22,893
- Come on. Ready?
- Yeah.

1296
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:24,978
Come on!

1297
02:29:25,665 --> 02:29:30,752
You might have spared
yourself. Stone dead.

1298
02:29:36,133 --> 02:29:37,801
No.

1299
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:43,932
It's his shin, he's fainted.

1300
02:29:45,768 --> 02:29:48,061
Come on, Kat, come on.

1301
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:11,710
He was talking.

1302
02:30:16,424 --> 02:30:18,550
Ten minutes ago.

1303
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:26,057
We were talking.

1304
02:30:49,957 --> 02:30:53,418
It is autumn.
We wait for the end.

1305
02:30:54,628 --> 02:30:56,546
We wait for the Armistice.

1306
02:30:57,465 --> 02:30:59,466
We wait for peace.

1307
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:13,438
Dear Albert, I write to tell you
you and I are the last ones left.

1308
02:31:14,982 --> 02:31:20,320
Soon after Kat died, Tjaden got it -
a quick and merciful death,

1309
02:31:20,488 --> 02:31:22,197
a bullet in the head.

1310
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:25,241
Himmelstoss was killed
the same day

1311
02:31:25,409 --> 02:31:27,744
and now Detering is gone.

1312
02:31:30,331 --> 02:31:33,666
I think we started
to lose Detering last spring,

1313
02:31:33,834 --> 02:31:36,336
when the apple trees came into bloom.

1314
02:31:37,004 --> 02:31:39,964
You know that expression of his
in springtime?

1315
02:31:40,591 --> 02:31:45,011
Two weeks ago he was missed
at roll-call, nowhere to be found.

1316
02:31:45,846 --> 02:31:49,307
A week later we heard he had been caught
by the Military Police.

1317
02:31:49,475 --> 02:31:54,813
You and I know where he was going.
Home, to the harvest.

1318
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:58,858
We have not heard anything more,
but you know the penalty for desertion.

1319
02:32:00,861 --> 02:32:03,947
Albert, of the class of 1916,

1320
02:32:04,490 --> 02:32:08,368
out of the 20 who enlisted,
13 are dead.

1321
02:32:08,953 --> 02:32:11,204
Four are missing.

1322
02:32:11,956 --> 02:32:14,374
One is in a madhouse.

1323
02:32:15,334 --> 02:32:17,710
You and I live.

1324
02:32:17,878 --> 02:32:19,796
How I miss you.

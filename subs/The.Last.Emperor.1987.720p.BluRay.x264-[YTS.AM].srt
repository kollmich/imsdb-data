1
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,803
The war criminals will
proceed in orderly fashion

2
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,668
to the main waiting room
and await instructions.

3
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,730
No talking!
Obey the guards!

4
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,696
War criminals must proceed to
the main waiting room!

5
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,785
Those caught talking
will be severely punished!

6
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,667
The Emperor!

7
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,631
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

8
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,467
What do they think they're doing?
Stop! It is dangerous!

9
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,513
Go back. Go back. Go!

10
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,140
Are you mad?
They could kill us all!

11
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,267
Go! Go!

12
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,930
Open the door! Open the door!

13
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:33,977
Open the door! Open the door!

14
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,635
Mama!

15
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:36,707
By the command of Her Imperial Majesty,
also called, the compassionate,

16
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:43,338
and the Blessed, the Respectful, and the
Long-Living, the Empress Dowager commands.

17
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:48,343
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi,
son of Prince Chun,

18
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,708
shall be transferred
immediately to the Forbidden

19
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:56,210
City and will remain
in the great within,

20
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,939
awaiting Her Majesty's
decision. Respect this!

21
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:43,440
Ar Mo, I am giving you my son.
My son is your son!

22
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,942
Quick! Quick!

23
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,452
I want to go home!

24
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:43,709
Look, look at all the camels.
And look at the Forbidden City!

25
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,204
Give him to me.

26
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,874
Ar Mo!

27
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,407
Pu Yi, come here.

28
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:05,259
How small you are. Are you
afraid of me? Everyone is.

29
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,898
I am the Grand Empress Dowager,

30
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,987
and I have lived here
for a long, long time.

31
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:38,175
And they call me the old Buddha.

32
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:49,686
This is Peony. Do you like her?

33
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:57,486
Men, you know, are not allowed
in the Forbidden City after dark.

34
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,740
Even little men like you!

35
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:08,580
The only man who can live here is
the Emperor.

36
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:17,714
But the Emperor is on high,
riding the dragon now!

37
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,511
He died today!

38
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,037
Longevity.

39
00:13:53,083 --> 00:14:01,083
These other men, they're not real men.
They're all eunuchs.

40
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,561
And, now, they're all
waiting for me to die.

41
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:21,896
That is why they're putting my bed in the
middle of the room, under the black pearl.

42
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:35,701
Little Pu Yi, I have decided that you will
be the new Lord of Ten Thousand Years.

43
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:47,846
You will be the Son of Heaven.

44
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,860
Are we going home, Papa?

45
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:11,240
Sssh! Sssh! Sssh!
It will soon be over.

46
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,868
Look!

47
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,678
Look!

48
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,330
Papa, cricket!

49
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,225
Cricket! Cricket! Where's the cricket?

50
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:49,606
Ahh, he is my friend, Your Majesty.
Safe and warm under my arm.

51
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,819
Kept me company on the long journey here.

52
00:19:54,444 --> 00:20:00,742
Ahh, see? He is kowtowing to
Your Majesty.

53
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:05,330
Now, he can be
the Emperor's cricket!

54
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,757
Can't let anybody in!

55
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,528
His soup is getting cold!

56
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,530
Get out of here!

57
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,312
- Where am I?
- In the People's Republic of China.

58
00:20:58,592 --> 00:20:59,968
Why did you stop me?

59
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,638
You are a criminal!
You must be judged.

60
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,516
I'm the Lord of Ten Thousand Years.

61
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,435
Go.

62
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,912
If you really wanted to die,
you would have succeeded.

63
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,872
You will kill me anyway.

64
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:34,545
Whatever happens, you'll be kept alive
until you have been judged.

65
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,792
Your Majesty, this is the
Forbidden City.

66
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:23,260
Ah, look! This little one is Your Majesty's
bedroom. This is where we are.

67
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,053
Am I going home today?

68
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:30,851
Not today, not yet. A-And
here, look.

69
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:36,356
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony
where Your Majesty was crowned.

70
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:54,124
I give Your Majesty the Gate of
Marshall Valor.

71
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:59,338
- I give you the maju-gate the... gate!
- Yes.

72
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:06,887
Yes, and the Palace with
the Loudest Heaven... and... yes.

73
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,724
Your Majesty, your Imperial
bath is ready!

74
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:17,272
I don't like baths! I don't like
baths! I don't like baths!

75
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:24,279
I don't like baths anymore!
I don't like baths anymore!

76
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:29,785
I don't like baths! I don't like baths!

77
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,252
No bean curd today and no meat!

78
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,691
Is it true I can do anything I want?

79
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,568
Of course, Your Majesty!

80
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:07,906
Anything you want. You are
the Lord of Ten Thousand Years.

81
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:16,574
Oh! Oh! Oh, no! Not in my
face! Oh! Oh, no! No!

82
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:22,087
I'm the Son of Heaven!
I'm the Son of Heaven!

83
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:29,052
- Yes! Oh, yes!
- I am the Son of Heaven!

84
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:38,645
Ar Mo! I want to go home!
I want to go home! I want to go home!

85
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,232
I want to go home, Ar Mo!
I want to go home.

86
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:10,669
Once upon a time, there was
a great tree and a great wind.

87
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:16,475
The tree and the wind were
always fighting,

88
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,937
but when wind came back,

89
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:24,441
it was angrier and stronger
then ever.

90
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,825
Father.

91
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,722
My lady, she is the new nurse.

92
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,263
This is good breast milk.

93
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,814
Hey!
Come on, hurry!

94
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:56,195
And that's how you became my child.

95
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,517
I repeat.

96
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:02,847
Prisoners going to their
cells will walk with

97
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:06,074
their heads bowed. Keep
your eyes on the ground!

98
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:08,350
No looking forward or to the side!

99
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,145
The guards will give you directions
and tell you when to turn!

100
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,498
Eyes down! Move!

101
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:03,989
Pu Chieh.

102
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:36,688
Your guest is waiting to meet you,
Your Majesty.

103
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,695
Also, your mother has arrived.

104
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,835
You have not seen your mother
for many years, Your Majesty.

105
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,430
He is so small!

106
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,975
He is young, Your Majesty.

107
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,937
Go. Go!

108
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:24,903
The Emperor's brother,
His Excellency, Pu Chieh.

109
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,548
Ar Mo.

110
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,609
Stay with me.

111
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:13,035
How's the health of His
Majesty's mother?

112
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,166
It is better, thank you. How
much His Majesty has grown!

113
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:26,131
My mother has not seen me for
seven years!

114
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,054
Do you remember my face?

115
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,515
No!

116
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:39,311
The night they came with the horses,
I knew it would be like this.

117
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,063
My brother sees you every day!

118
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:45,234
Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you.
He often talks about you.

119
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,819
We are all very proud of you.

120
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,239
The kite.

121
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,366
He chose this for you.

122
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,383
Papa!

123
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,090
Some of my clothes are in these boxes.

124
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,638
This is the Imperial row.

125
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,974
My capes are in that big box.

126
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:00,934
What is that?

127
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:02,978
My medicines.

128
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:08,066
- Pills for rectifying the vapors.
- Look, a chamber pot.

129
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,863
These are my birds.

130
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:17,451
That is my heater,
and this is my camel.

131
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,520
They're turning away!

132
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:49,191
Of course! Ordinary people are
not allowed to look at the Emperor!

133
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,193
I am too important.

134
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:54,863
Is it true that you can do
whatever you want?

135
00:35:54,988 --> 00:36:00,661
Of course, I can. If I am naughty, someone
else is punished. One of them!

136
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,215
Stop!

137
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,968
The Emperor will walk.

138
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:29,690
I have never met other children.
Are they all like you?

139
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:32,359
I've got three sisters and two friends.

140
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,987
If you come to our house,
you can play with us.

141
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:37,239
The Emperor never leaves the
Palace.

142
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,576
We play games together!

143
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:43,370
I know a game, too! Run!

144
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:04,284
- The ones in the boat are the high consorts.
- High consorts?

145
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,745
The wives of the Emperor
before me.

146
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,916
They say they're my mother,
but they're not! They're not!

147
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,558
We asked you for the
books, so prisoners will

148
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,031
have to pass this around
or read it aloud.

149
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:14,016
The sooner you begin to learn,
the better. This is a school.

150
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,739
History of the new popular democracy.

151
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:37,915
Pages 84, 85.

152
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,545
In February 1912,

153
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:50,594
2 000 years of Imperial rule came to an end
with the abdication of the Manchoo Dynasty.

154
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,804
China became a republic.

155
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,350
It was the year of the Rat.

156
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:02,856
Are you interested in ancient history?

157
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,569
School...

158
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,531
This is a prison.

159
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:14,159
A real prison.

160
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,887
I told you to start reading.

161
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,849
You, there, read aloud. Read!

162
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:40,769
According

163
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:45,357
According

164
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:57,703
According to the treaty between
the empire and the first republic,

165
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:02,583
the Emperor's taitou was
retained and not abolished.

166
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:23,729
He would retain his palaces, and he paid
an annual subsidy of four million dollars.

167
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:31,361
The republic also guaranteed to protect
the Imperial tombs in perpetuity.

168
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:38,493
In return, the dynasty surrendered forever
its right to rule the country.

169
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:57,505
Man, his nature originally good.

170
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,951
Let us see what the
Emperor has done.

171
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:26,208
Your Majesty will do it
again five times.

172
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,709
Five times!

173
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,136
Ten times.

174
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:59,324
Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow!

175
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:02,411
But this is ordinary yellow.

176
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:05,622
- It is Imperial yellow!
- No, it is not!

177
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:10,586
We say it is! Only the Emperor
can wear that yellow! Take it off!

178
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,212
- No!
- Take it off!

179
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,798
No! And you're not the Emperor anymore!

180
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,758
There is a new Emperor now!

181
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:21,305
He has cut off his queue, and instead of a
camel, he has got a car!

182
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,307
What did you say?

183
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,559
You're not the Emperor!

184
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,732
Liar!

185
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,193
You're not the Emperor anymore!

186
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,112
Liar! Liar!

187
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,906
You're not the...

188
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,118
Liar!

189
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,208
You're not the Emperor!
How dare you!

190
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,428
Calm yourselves! Oh!

191
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:04,181
- You're not the Emperor!
- How dare you!

192
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:09,144
No! Your Majesty!
Calm yourselves!

193
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,563
Am I the Emperor or not?

194
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:15,108
Your Majesty will always be the Emperor.

195
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:17,778
- You see?
- Prove it!

196
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:28,155
Big Foot, drink it! Go on, drink
the green ink.

197
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,187
I will show you!

198
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:30,392
See? That is a car! He is the
President of the Republic.

199
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:51,014
Why is this wall here, Lord
Chamberlain?

200
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:55,894
It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed.

201
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,521
You are lying.

202
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:16,540
High Tutor, am I still the Emperor?

203
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:23,505
You will always be the Emperor inside
the Forbidden City, but not outside.

204
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:25,382
I do not understand.

205
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:30,929
Outside China is now a republic,
with a president.

206
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:37,436
Where is Ar Mo? Ar Mo?

207
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:01,668
You are all liars!

208
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:12,070
- Let me say "good-bye"!
- Hurry! Hurry!

209
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,311
He's my child! Ah!

210
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,624
Ar Mo? Ar Mo?

211
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:53,011
I do not understand.

212
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:55,556
I do not understand.

213
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:58,058
Your Majesty is a big boy now.

214
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:00,769
He cannot have a wet nurse anymore.

215
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:04,481
It is much better like this.
Much healthier.

216
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:07,109
But she is not my wet nurse.

217
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:10,237
She's my butterfly.

218
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,089
Ar Mo! Ar Mo!

219
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:41,059
Ar Mo! Ar Mo!

220
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:45,439
Ar Mo! Ar Mo!

221
00:52:56,134 --> 00:53:03,267
This is the detention center of
the Fushun Bureau of Public Security.

222
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:05,727
And I am the governor!

223
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:10,941
During the war, this was a
Japanese prison.

224
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:13,694
Many of you may remember it.

225
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:16,613
Because you worked with the Japanese,

226
00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:23,245
you were responsible for building it,
and you filled it with innocent people.

227
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,248
How could this happen?

228
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,917
Why did you betray your
country?

229
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,795
What turned you into war
criminals?

230
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,465
We believe that men are
born good!

231
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:39,494
We believe that the only
way to change is to

232
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,040
discover the truth and
look at it in the face.

233
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,184
That is why you are here.

234
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:51,815
You will begin by writing the story of your
lives and by confessing your crimes.

235
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:57,905
Your salvation will lie entirely
in the attitude you take!

236
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:02,485
I advise you to be frank and sincere.

237
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:06,055
Otherwise, things can still
go very badly for you.

238
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,835
You have learned that
song very quickly.

239
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:14,713
That is a good beginning.

240
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,577
It is snowing.

241
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:55,963
We must stick to the same story, or they
will turn our words against us.

242
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:41,610
After a few years, the tiny republic had
become as corrupt as the old Empire.

243
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:46,240
It fell quickly into the hands of ambitious
generals and corrupt bureaucrats.

244
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:53,288
The era of the warlords had begun. By May
1919, when I received my appointment,

245
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:55,541
China was in turmoil.

246
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:49,887
China awake.

247
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:56,894
Did you know they're now selling
electoral votes on the stock market?

248
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:00,844
Nothing has changed
with the republic,

249
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:04,009
either inside or outside
the Forbidden City.

250
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:07,321
- Except for the bicycles.
- The students are angry.

251
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:08,822
But what can they do
except shout?

252
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:10,324
The shops are closing.

253
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:12,284
Oh, so, they are.

254
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,995
Maybe we'll be late after all.

255
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,705
Shall we take a short cut?

256
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,665
- Yes.
- Use our feet.

257
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,333
Remember, you're one of the
first foreigners with an

258
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,642
official post in the Forbidden
City since Marco Polo.

259
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:18,994
It makes me very nervous.

260
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,137
The enemy.

261
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:50,025
Is there a dagger in my back?

262
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,527
Not yet.

263
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:02,158
My friend, it is not easy
to forgive a foreign

264
01:01:02,184 --> 01:01:06,183
devil who knows Confucius
better than they do.

265
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:10,420
And grows the finest peonies in Peking!

266
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:25,811
May the new tutor present himself!

267
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:44,162
Your Imperial Highness, the new tutor.

268
01:01:57,467 --> 01:02:00,554
The Emperor is honored to
welcome his tutor.

269
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:04,975
Your tutor is honored to have
been chosen, Your Majesty.

270
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:18,780
One more time.

271
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:25,746
Your Imperial Highness,
Mr. Reginald Fleming Johnston.

272
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,001
How do you do, Mr. Johnston?

273
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:34,213
How do you do, Your Majesty?

274
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:47,142
Now we will go to school.

275
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:01,073
Please begin the lesson.

276
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:05,130
Your Majesty, in my
country, it would be usual

277
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,146
to begin with some kind
of an examination.

278
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,874
The Emperor cannot be examined.

279
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,794
Well, that may have to change.

280
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,131
But first, Your Majesty might
like to ask me some questions.

281
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:23,804
Where are your ancestors buried?

282
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:26,807
In Scotland, Your Majesty.

283
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:30,811
But then, where's your skirt?

284
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:34,481
In your country, men wear short skirts,
do they not?

285
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:39,778
No, Your Majesty, Scotsmen do not
wear skirts. They wear kilts.

286
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,029
Kilts.

287
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:46,743
Kilts. A matter of words, perhaps,
but words are important.

288
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,745
Why are words important?

289
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:54,126
If you cannot say what you mean, Your
Majesty, you will never mean what you say.

290
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:58,505
And a gentleman should always
mean what he says.

291
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:03,886
Ah, yes! A gentleman.
Are you a gentleman?

292
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:10,267
I would like to be a gentleman,
Your Majesty. I try to be.

293
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:16,565
I'm not a gentleman. I'm not
allowed to say what I mean.

294
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,234
They are always telling me
what to say.

295
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:24,656
Your Majesty is still very young.

296
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:31,246
I thought he might like to see some
English and American magazines.

297
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:35,292
I have just received them.

298
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:50,140
I know that you know that I
know that you know that,

299
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:54,603
that is a dialog between
Confucius and Chuang Tzu.

300
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:59,191
Concerning respect, Your Majesty.

301
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,165
Who is this "George Washington"?

302
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,459
A famous American, Your Majesty.

303
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:21,421
A revolutionary General,
the first American President.

304
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:24,174
Ah! Like Mr. Lenin in Russia?

305
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,510
Not quite.

306
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:29,221
Does he have a car?

307
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:33,809
He lived a long time ago, Your Majesty.

308
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,353
I want a car.

309
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:48,448
I think your mouse is trying to
escape, Your Majesty.

310
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,955
Please do not tell anyone about
my mouse.

311
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,385
The lesson is finished.

312
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:45,172
Our official taster's a brave man.

313
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:49,134
Many of my ancestors
have been poisoned, you know.

314
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:56,266
Does Your Majesty have lunch
like this every day?

315
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:58,644
Oh, yes! Every day!
Like theater!

316
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:01,855
I do not know why.
It has always been like that.

317
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,274
This is my royal food.

318
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:12,032
Your Majesty!
One hundred year eggs.

319
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:14,910
Snake bow.

320
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:18,413
Angel's hair.

321
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:28,674
Garlic sprout, steamed turtle,
goat nipples...

322
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,260
There's a danger of poisoning pots.

323
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:34,721
My food comes directly
from the high consorts.

324
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:37,140
Their tasters had already tried them.

325
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:39,518
It always arrives a bit cold.

326
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,995
How do they kill Emperors in
the West?

327
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:02,499
The Austrian Emperor was shot, was he not?

328
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:06,920
No, but his nephew was assassinated
before the Great War.

329
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:10,632
But the Russian Emperor had
been shot. He was called the Tsar.

330
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,636
- Yes.
- He took lots of our land in Manchuria.

331
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:19,308
I'm a Manchurian. Even after the republic,
it's still my country.

332
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:48,212
The-uh... secret, Your Majesty,
is emerging again.

333
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,656
Is something the matter, Your Majesty?

334
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:17,908
Something is happening.

335
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:20,661
Silence. Tell them to be quiet.

336
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,162
Silence.

337
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:26,834
Silence.

338
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,549
What is happening,
Mr. Johnston?

339
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:35,634
- Uh, nothing is happening.
- Quiet!

340
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:24,892
On my way here, Your Majesty, we were
held up by students from the university.

341
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:28,103
They were protesting against the
republican government,

342
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:32,482
because it has agreed to give
away Chinese territory to Japan.

343
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:39,531
Is it true, Mr. Johnston, that many people
out there have had their heads chopped off?

344
01:10:39,656 --> 01:10:45,370
It is true, Your Majesty.
Many heads have been chopped off.

345
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,999
It does stop them thinking.

346
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,127
It is time for the Emperor's rest.

347
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:54,546
The students are right to be angry.

348
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:01,929
I'm angry!

349
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,974
But I'm not allowed
to leave the Forbidden City.

350
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,020
I want to go out,
Mr. Johnston!

351
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:11,522
My lord!

352
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:15,400
I want to see the city of sounds!

353
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:28,372
The Emperor awards you with
the order of the Ruby Hat Button,

354
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:33,794
and with the right to be carried in your
own chair, with four bearers.

355
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:58,151
The last Emperor died
on the same night

356
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:02,614
as the Empress Guwalgiya, the night
I was brought to the Forbidden City,

357
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:04,116
when I was three.

358
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:09,329
The eunuchs think he was murdered,
but who killed him.

359
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:12,374
And why?
And who will kill me?

360
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:21,258
The chair, your excellency.

361
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:31,768
The traditional gift to eunuchs.

362
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:35,397
Many thanks. Be grateful.

363
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:38,442
- If it is official practice,
- Always, sir, always, sir.

364
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:41,778
In which case, I would like an
official receipt.

365
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:56,335
Stop!

366
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:03,300
One, two,

367
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:08,514
Three, four, five...

368
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:10,724
Emperor extends his apologies.

369
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:14,144
Please tell the Emperor
that there is no offense.

370
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:16,897
Emperor who has been offended.

371
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:23,445
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen...

372
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:39,962
Even the bicycle was viewed with
suspicion in the Forbidden City.

373
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:43,841
My present to the Emperor
lead to a lot of trouble.

374
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,120
Change about!

375
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:42,042
I hope the Emperor has not forgotten
that this is the day for his math class.

376
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:52,302
For Your Majesty!

377
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:55,472
My doctor says,
"Bicycles are bad for you."

378
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:57,641
Bad for you, nonsense!

379
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:08,861
How does it work?

380
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:12,364
Oh, it's simple.

381
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:20,664
Head up and eyes forward!
As in math!

382
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:05,834
My mother is dead, is she not?

383
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,003
Yes, Your Majesty.

384
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:10,756
I'm profoundly sorry!

385
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:12,257
I'm not.

386
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:17,888
She killed herself.

387
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,599
She swallowed the ball of opium.

388
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,728
I'm going to see her, and my brother.

389
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:29,186
Open the door. Open the door.

390
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:42,866
Open the door.

391
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:07,526
Fallen devil and fallen machine.
Trouble! Nothing but trouble!

392
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:17,002
- Look where you lead him!
- And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man.

393
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:21,798
The boy's mother is dead,
and he's not even allowed to see her!

394
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:25,469
I want to go home!

395
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:27,387
I want to go home!

396
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:31,725
Stop it, stop it, stay where you are!

397
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,393
I want to go home!

398
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:36,730
Stop it, stay where you are!

399
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:40,108
You fool! Stay there!

400
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:42,861
Chang!

401
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:45,322
Hunchback, Big Foot!

402
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:34,154
Sir? Give me your hand, sir.
Give me your hand, sir!

403
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:49,344
Can you not see?

404
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:05,277
Look at my left ear, please, sir.

405
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:12,326
Thank you, and my right.
Thank you.

406
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:15,621
Would you follow my finger, please, sir.

407
01:23:28,634 --> 01:23:31,720
Just the eyes, Your Majesty, not the head.

408
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:41,897
Well, it's perfectly simple, Johnston.
The Emperor needs spectacles.

409
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,567
Like Harold Lloyd!

410
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:50,072
Impossible! An Emperor does
not wear spectacles!

411
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:52,157
That cannot be allowed!

412
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:55,827
Times have changed,
Your Highnesses!

413
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:15,180
If His Majesty doesn't get spectacles,
Johnston, he could lose his sight.

414
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:22,938
Now, please, could you show me
the way out of here?

415
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,817
Your Majesty.

416
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:49,631
If the Emperor does not get
spectacles, I will resign.

417
01:24:50,299 --> 01:24:53,427
Unfortunately,
our decision is final.

418
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:58,974
And, unfortunately, what I have to say will
be published in every newspaper in China.

419
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:05,606
What do you have to say,
Mr. Johnston?

420
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:10,277
The Emperor has been a prisoner
in his own palace since the day

421
01:25:10,402 --> 01:25:13,655
that he was crowned and has remained
a prisoner since he abdicated.

422
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:17,159
But now that he's growing up, he may
wonder why he is the only person in China

423
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:19,995
who may not walk out of
his own front door.

424
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:25,959
I think the Emperor is the
loneliest boy on earth.

425
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:32,925
It would be conveniently sad
if he becomes blind.

426
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,761
Blind, Mr. Johnston?

427
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:40,166
To the expense, Your Excellency.
To the cost of

428
01:25:40,192 --> 01:25:43,293
maintaining one thousand
two hundred eunuchs,

429
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:45,270
three hundred and fifty
ladies-in-waiting

430
01:25:45,395 --> 01:25:49,566
and one hundred and eighty-five
cooks to buying a hundred

431
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:54,071
and twenty sable furs a month and
three thousand chickens a week.

432
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:56,910
To the fact that eight
hundred and forty guards

433
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:59,309
and employees of the
household department,

434
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:03,413
plus one Lord Chamberlain,
care only about one thing!

435
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:06,834
Filling their own rice bowls!

436
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:10,754
You are very good at accounts,
Mr. Johnston!

437
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:13,382
The Emperor may have abdicated,

438
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:18,136
but he's still a symbol
of great importance to many people.

439
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:22,850
If I did not agree with that,
I would not be here.

440
01:26:24,434 --> 01:26:30,524
And some of us believe that one day soon,
he may be more than a symbol.

441
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:33,443
The spectacles are a detail.

442
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:37,281
What do you really want,
Mr. Johnston?

443
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:40,117
Just the spectacles.

444
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:42,638
The Princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty.
Seventeen years old.

445
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:58,612
Princess Wu Chang,
fifteen years old.

446
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:07,371
The princess De Li, Your Majesty,
and the Princess Fung Ying.

447
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:12,376
The Princess Wang Ching.

448
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:27,975
The Princess Shilean,
sixteen years old.

449
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:35,023
Who is this?

450
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,527
Princess Wen Hsiu,
twelve years old.

451
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,742
She has got a funny face.

452
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:29,953
Not just one wife. One empress
and one secondary consort.

453
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:33,373
- Two wives?   - But who did you
choose to be the Empress?

454
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:37,294
They chose her! She's very old,
Johnston! She's seventeen!

455
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:41,882
That's not so old, Your Majesty.
What does she look like?

456
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:47,721
Old fashioned! I want a modern wife,
Johnston, who speaks English and French!

457
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:52,559
And who can dance the quickstep!

458
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:10,160
Johnston!

459
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:13,747
Sir!

460
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:15,874
I'm going to escape, Johnston.

461
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:18,961
I've got a suitcase,
and a ticket to England.

462
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:21,880
I'm going to Oxford University.

463
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:28,679
Your Majesty, if you get married, you will
become the master of your own house.

464
01:30:28,804 --> 01:30:32,516
A wedding might be a more
practical way to escape.

465
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:15,392
I suppose she's on her way by now.

466
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:20,022
It will be all right.
They do everything for you.

467
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:31,742
Why did you never get married,
Johnston?

468
01:31:45,923 --> 01:31:49,700
Your Mongolian cousin
Prince Demchukedamgruv

469
01:31:49,726 --> 01:31:52,579
has sent you twelve
racing camels.

470
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,932
Plus this.

471
01:31:59,603 --> 01:32:02,856
On behalf of Manchuria.

472
01:32:07,945 --> 01:32:10,113
A lump of coal.

473
01:32:11,114 --> 01:32:13,116
Manchuria...

474
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:43,213
The secondary consort
welcomes the Empress.

475
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:46,884
The Empress greets
the secondary consort.

476
01:32:57,828 --> 01:32:59,496
You are doing everything very well.

477
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:02,291
Thank you.
I rehearsed many times.

478
01:34:49,898 --> 01:34:51,608
What is His Majesty thinking?

479
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:56,989
I was thinking, if I was the real Emperor,
I would become the ruler of China now.

480
01:34:58,115 --> 01:35:01,660
And what would the Emperor do,
if he could really rule?

481
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:05,247
I would change everything,
even the way we get married.

482
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:09,209
Is the Emperor against arranged
marriages?

483
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:12,504
It is humiliating not to choose
whom you marry!

484
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:16,216
Even I was not allowed
to choose.

485
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:20,012
And yet westerners might be amazed

486
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:23,682
how much happiness can come from
arranged marriages.

487
01:35:23,807 --> 01:35:27,436
That is what old-fashioned women say,
like the high consorts.

488
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:50,751
In another year or two, His Majesty
will be taller than me.

489
01:35:52,294 --> 01:35:56,798
Is it true the Emperor has a suitcase
under his bed and is going to Oxford?

490
01:35:58,592 --> 01:36:01,178
Will the Emperor take
Wan Jung with him?

491
01:36:02,763 --> 01:36:06,600
Perhaps he would like to
see my face before he decides.

492
01:36:08,018 --> 01:36:12,397
Yes, the Emperor would like to
see the face of the Empress.

493
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:21,031
It is the Emperor who must
remove the kait'ou.

494
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:42,779
I also had a tutor like Mr. Johnston.

495
01:37:45,782 --> 01:37:52,748
Miss Windsor. She's American.

496
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:16,188
Miss Windsor taught me how to
do the dance of the quickstep.

497
01:38:18,524 --> 01:38:20,859
Does the Emperor know how to
do the quickstep?

498
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:24,112
Will you teach me?

499
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:48,947
Leave us! Leave us!

500
01:40:11,428 --> 01:40:15,050
If Your Majesty thinks
it is old-fashioned to

501
01:40:15,076 --> 01:40:18,460
make the rain and the
wind with a stranger,

502
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,064
we can be like a modern couple,
to begin with.

503
01:40:22,356 --> 01:40:23,732
A modern couple?

504
01:40:25,943 --> 01:40:27,319
Good night.

505
01:40:27,861 --> 01:40:29,238
Good night.

506
01:40:37,454 --> 01:40:39,456
You must come to Oxford with me.

507
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:53,011
I like him! I am sure
I am going to like him!

508
01:41:08,902 --> 01:41:10,571
And he will grow up!

509
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:12,906
Eyes down!

510
01:41:20,289 --> 01:41:21,665
Report your arrival!

511
01:41:22,165 --> 01:41:24,334
Prisoner 981 reporting.

512
01:41:24,459 --> 01:41:27,629
- Louder!
- Prisoner 981 reporting.

513
01:41:28,046 --> 01:41:29,423
Open the door!

514
01:41:35,721 --> 01:41:37,097
Close the door!

515
01:41:41,393 --> 01:41:42,769
Sit down!

516
01:41:47,858 --> 01:41:49,109
Name?

517
01:41:49,234 --> 01:41:50,861
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

518
01:41:50,986 --> 01:41:52,362
Write it!

519
01:42:12,216 --> 01:42:13,842
Now read that aloud!

520
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:19,973
Leniency to those who confess,
severity to those who resist,

521
01:42:20,098 --> 01:42:22,976
Redemption to those who gain merits.

522
01:42:27,397 --> 01:42:31,527
Now than, there are two types
of confession.

523
01:42:32,653 --> 01:42:36,865
We call them
toothpaste and water tap.

524
01:42:37,449 --> 01:42:40,712
The toothpaste prisoner
needs to be squeezed every

525
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:44,064
now and then or else he
forgets to keep confessing.

526
01:42:45,499 --> 01:42:50,212
The water tap man needs one good
hard twist before he starts.

527
01:42:50,504 --> 01:42:52,047
But then everything comes out.

528
01:42:52,172 --> 01:42:58,554
Now, you're an intelligent person.
I'm sure you understand me.

529
01:42:59,096 --> 01:43:02,266
Good.
Then we will begin.

530
01:43:04,017 --> 01:43:06,854
Why do you think you are
in here, 981?

531
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:12,484
I'm accused of being a traitor, a
collaborator, and a counter-revolutionary.

532
01:43:12,609 --> 01:43:14,236
It is not an accusation!

533
01:43:14,361 --> 01:43:18,991
You are a traitor, you are a collaborator,
and you are a counter-revolutionary!!

534
01:43:26,164 --> 01:43:30,627
Did you write this?
And you call it a confession?

535
01:43:30,752 --> 01:43:34,590
This is nothing but a list of dates!
A child's fairy tale!

536
01:43:45,893 --> 01:43:47,311
What do you want me to confess?

537
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:50,564
You know what you did and
what others did.

538
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:53,066
So why don't you
volunteer the information?

539
01:43:53,192 --> 01:43:54,735
I do not understand.

540
01:43:54,860 --> 01:44:00,157
We don't tell people what to confess.
We already know everything about you.

541
01:44:07,956 --> 01:44:09,333
I...

542
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:11,543
Go on.

543
01:44:12,252 --> 01:44:14,505
I wanted reforms.

544
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:17,883
What did you want to reform?

545
01:44:18,008 --> 01:44:19,510
Everything.

546
01:44:35,108 --> 01:44:41,782
Chang, you have a house outside
the Forbidden City. Do you not?

547
01:44:43,659 --> 01:44:47,746
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- It has 20 rooms, I understand.

548
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:55,796
And you also have houses.

549
01:44:55,921 --> 01:44:59,424
Oh, we all do, Your Majesty.

550
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:05,639
I recently learned that many pieces from
the Imperial collections are on sale

551
01:45:05,764 --> 01:45:09,685
in antique shops in Peking.
Is that true, Cheng?

552
01:47:12,558 --> 01:47:15,811
- Would you do me a favor, Wen Hsiu?
- Of course.

553
01:47:16,311 --> 01:47:18,313
Stop growing.

554
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:54,099
The Forbidden City is a theater
without an audience.

555
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:59,229
The audience left long ago
when China became a republic.

556
01:48:03,233 --> 01:48:07,196
- Cut off my queue.
- Your Majesty! Please!

557
01:48:42,022 --> 01:48:43,273
It is heavy!

558
01:48:43,398 --> 01:48:49,279
The Emperor before me was murdered
because he wanted to reform the empire.

559
01:48:49,404 --> 01:48:51,198
Is that not so, Mr. Johnston?

560
01:48:51,323 --> 01:48:54,493
Yes, Your Majesty, probably.

561
01:48:54,618 --> 01:49:00,374
Well, let us see if they will kill me for
reforming the Forbidden City.

562
01:49:00,499 --> 01:49:05,128
Lord Chamberlain! I'm appointing
Mr. Johnston's friend,

563
01:49:05,254 --> 01:49:09,091
the poet and scholar, Chin Hsiao Hsiu,
to be the new Lord Chamberlain.

564
01:49:09,216 --> 01:49:14,388
I want him to supervise a detailed
inventory of the Imperial storerooms!

565
01:49:14,513 --> 01:49:18,517
So that we can learn exactly
how much has been stolen!

566
01:50:04,897 --> 01:50:08,358
Can I sleep here?
I am frightened.

567
01:50:25,918 --> 01:50:30,297
You're brave.
Are you not frightened?

568
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:36,845
I am excited.
I do not want to escape anymore.

569
01:50:37,971 --> 01:50:39,473
I want to rule.

570
01:50:42,768 --> 01:50:44,144
Kiss me.

571
01:51:13,841 --> 01:51:15,801
Can I stay with you as well?

572
01:51:18,178 --> 01:51:20,389
Get in. Get in.

573
01:51:40,951 --> 01:51:43,704
I used to play a game with the eunuchs.

574
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:50,419
Trying to guess who is who.

575
01:51:52,296 --> 01:51:54,131
Now I cannot see you!

576
01:52:04,349 --> 01:52:08,729
Wan Jung? Wen Hsiu?

577
01:52:11,148 --> 01:52:13,150
Come underneath the sheet with us.

578
01:53:53,625 --> 01:53:57,171
Your Majesty! The storeroom's
on fire, Your Majesty!

579
01:54:12,477 --> 01:54:16,015
Chang Chinghui, did you
not write a poem about

580
01:54:16,041 --> 01:54:19,051
a spider who gets
caught in his own web?

581
01:54:20,569 --> 01:54:26,700
I did not know Your Majesty had read
my poetry. I'm very honored.

582
01:54:26,825 --> 01:54:28,869
I'm the spider.

583
01:54:28,994 --> 01:54:33,999
The eunuchs set fire to this place to
stop me knowing what they have stolen.

584
01:54:34,124 --> 01:54:37,503
I'm going to expel them
from the Forbidden City.

585
01:54:37,628 --> 01:54:41,006
There are twelve hundred eunuchs,
Your Majesty.

586
01:54:41,131 --> 01:54:43,509
They have been here for
eight hundred years.

587
01:54:43,634 --> 01:54:45,636
It will be dangerous.

588
01:54:45,761 --> 01:54:48,722
Do you think the republican government
would help me?

589
01:54:48,847 --> 01:54:54,728
The republicans will do almost anything
if you know who to speak to.

590
01:54:54,853 --> 01:54:56,897
It must happen quickly.

591
01:54:57,147 --> 01:55:00,400
Before they burn the whole
place with us inside.

592
01:56:03,839 --> 01:56:08,927
I lived with them all my life, Johnston.
They're my family.

593
01:56:09,052 --> 01:56:12,306
Your Majesty, there is no alternative.

594
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:32,242
- What is happening?
- I don't know.

595
01:56:44,046 --> 01:56:45,422
What are they carrying?

596
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:48,217
Their organs.

597
01:56:48,967 --> 01:56:52,364
Whatever their crimes,
they cannot be deprived

598
01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:55,207
of the right to be
buried as whole men.

599
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:53,073
Well?

600
01:57:58,829 --> 01:58:00,539
I have forgot what
I was saying.

601
01:58:00,664 --> 01:58:02,207
You're wasting our time!

602
01:58:02,332 --> 01:58:04,835
We want to know about the Japanese.

603
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:11,258
How did your friendship
with the Japanese begin?

604
01:58:11,383 --> 01:58:13,468
Who introduced you?
When?

605
01:58:16,513 --> 01:58:24,513
It was... I think it was the new Lord
Chamberlain, Chin Hsiao Hsiu. It was 1924.

606
01:58:27,774 --> 01:58:31,778
Parliament had been dissolved again.
The president had fled.

607
01:58:31,904 --> 01:58:38,911
At first, I thought it was just another a
coup d'etat by just another warlord.

608
01:58:40,412 --> 01:58:46,793
Only this time it was different.
This time it was my turn.

609
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:52,466
Fifteen, love.

610
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,616
Play.

611
01:59:24,414 --> 01:59:27,501
Your Highness, how shocking.

612
01:59:27,626 --> 01:59:29,378
Thirty love.

613
01:59:31,421 --> 01:59:32,923
Ready?

614
01:59:39,304 --> 01:59:41,431
Thirty, fifteen.

615
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:22,181
The rotten government of
the republic is in flight!

616
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:25,287
Now we shall remove the
foreign stench of the

617
02:00:25,313 --> 02:00:28,420
Manchurian rats who still
hide in the Forbidden City.

618
02:00:45,662 --> 02:00:52,127
Mr. Pu Yi and his family have been given
one hour to leave the Forbidden City.

619
02:00:53,712 --> 02:00:56,590
They will be escorted
to the home of his father

620
02:00:56,715 --> 02:01:03,722
and remain there under guard as state
prisoners until further notice.

621
02:01:09,811 --> 02:01:13,857
What are you all looking at?
What are you standing there for?

622
02:01:13,982 --> 02:01:16,068
You always wanted to leave
the Forbidden City.

623
02:01:16,193 --> 02:01:22,407
Now you're got an hour to pack.
So, go! Go!

624
02:01:35,087 --> 02:01:42,261
I always thought I hated it here.
Now, I'm afraid to leave.

625
02:01:43,178 --> 02:01:44,429
Do you think they will kill me?

626
02:01:44,555 --> 02:01:49,226
You must do as they say, Your Majesty,
while I try to reach the British Embassy.

627
02:01:49,351 --> 02:01:54,982
They will give you asylum there.
I'm sure they will.

628
02:01:55,566 --> 02:01:59,486
Chang, take my car to the South gate!
I want you to drive His Majesty.

629
02:03:29,159 --> 02:03:30,536
Your Majesty!

630
02:04:23,797 --> 02:04:25,048
Please, Your Majesty!

631
02:04:25,174 --> 02:04:26,550
What?

632
02:05:37,079 --> 02:05:40,123
But you didn't go to
the British Embassy, did you?

633
02:05:40,249 --> 02:05:42,459
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy.

634
02:05:42,584 --> 02:05:45,462
The Japanese were the only people
prepared to help me.

635
02:05:45,587 --> 02:05:46,964
Help you for nothing?

636
02:05:49,424 --> 02:05:52,553
Japan has an Emperor.
We're almost the same age.

637
02:05:53,387 --> 02:05:55,180
I thought it was kindness.

638
02:05:56,598 --> 02:06:00,811
At the same time, I realized that,
for many Chinese, I was an alien.

639
02:06:00,936 --> 02:06:03,730
Simply because I am Manchurian.

640
02:06:04,523 --> 02:06:09,194
There was even an anti-Manchurian
league who wanted to assassinate me!

641
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:12,531
So, I went to live in Tientsin.

642
02:06:14,491 --> 02:06:18,954
There was a nice provincial town
with a big port.

643
02:06:19,413 --> 02:06:23,166
In those days, we had a large,
international settlement.

644
02:06:23,292 --> 02:06:25,878
The Japanese thought it would
be safer for me there.

645
02:06:26,003 --> 02:06:29,381
If you had read the books we
gave you more carefully,

646
02:06:29,506 --> 02:06:32,434
you might have learned
that the anti-Manchurian

647
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:35,204
league was largely
financed by the Japanese.

648
02:06:35,304 --> 02:06:37,639
It was designed to frighten you.

649
02:06:37,931 --> 02:06:39,933
I did not know that at the time.

650
02:06:40,517 --> 02:06:43,687
- Cigarette?
- I do not smoke.

651
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,900
Were the Japanese paying
for you in Tientsin?

652
02:06:48,025 --> 02:06:49,401
Oh, no.

653
02:06:50,027 --> 02:06:55,616
I had to rent a villa,
the Villa Chan, and it was very expensive.

654
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:57,784
So were the bodyguards.

655
02:06:59,161 --> 02:07:01,538
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin.

656
02:07:01,663 --> 02:07:05,709
Did you still believe in a restoration
of the Imperial system?

657
02:07:05,834 --> 02:07:09,213
Others did.
They were later caught and exiled.

658
02:07:10,589 --> 02:07:13,592
I cannot remember how much jade
and jewelry they made me

659
02:07:13,717 --> 02:07:19,306
spend to buy the friendship of some warlord
or some white Russian general.

660
02:07:20,474 --> 02:07:24,561
I even financed an English
speaking newspaper.

661
02:07:24,686 --> 02:07:27,439
They closed after three days.
It was unreadable.

662
02:07:27,564 --> 02:07:29,274
And what else did you spend
your money on?

663
02:07:29,399 --> 02:07:34,279
Oh, I was never tired of buying pianos,
watches, radios...

664
02:07:34,404 --> 02:07:36,365
As long as they were foreign!

665
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:40,285
Of course.
Anything Western was good.

666
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:44,790
Especially Wrigley's chewing gum,
Bayer aspirin, and cars.

667
02:07:44,915 --> 02:07:47,992
While you were in Tientsin,
most of China came

668
02:07:48,018 --> 02:07:51,029
under the control of
General Chiang Kai Shek,

669
02:07:51,129 --> 02:07:55,384
the so-called Nationalists,
the Kuomintang.

670
02:07:55,801 --> 02:07:57,845
What were your relations with them?

671
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:59,346
None.

672
02:08:01,265 --> 02:08:06,436
I felt useless in Tientsin.
I was twenty-one.

673
02:08:07,229 --> 02:08:09,898
I dreamt of going to the West.

674
02:08:11,149 --> 02:08:12,776
I became a playboy.

675
02:08:17,739 --> 02:08:23,579
Am I blue. Am I blue.

676
02:08:24,121 --> 02:08:32,121
Ain't these tears in my eyes
telling you. Am I blue?

677
02:08:33,672 --> 02:08:38,949
You'd be, too. If each plan with
your girl done fell through.

678
02:08:38,975 --> 02:08:41,697
Was a time, I was her only one.

679
02:08:49,605 --> 02:08:57,605
But now I'm the sad and lonely one.
Boo-Boo-Boo, Boo-Boo-Boo.

680
02:09:02,784 --> 02:09:10,784
Now she's gone and we're
through. Lord, I'm blue.

681
02:09:22,262 --> 02:09:24,848
- Very good.
- Well done.

682
02:10:01,468 --> 02:10:03,929
That's a great ship,
if you're going first-class.

683
02:10:07,057 --> 02:10:08,934
I'm not going anywhere.

684
02:10:13,522 --> 02:10:15,023
Would you like to dance?

685
02:10:24,533 --> 02:10:27,870
You're a brave man. Nobody here
would have danced with me.

686
02:10:27,995 --> 02:10:29,496
Why is that?

687
02:10:31,206 --> 02:10:35,169
- Because I'm Chinese.
- Well, I'm American.

688
02:10:46,221 --> 02:10:49,433
You say California.
I say French Riviera.

689
02:10:49,558 --> 02:10:51,018
San Francisco!

690
02:10:51,143 --> 02:10:56,064
Monte Carlo! Are we really going this time?

691
02:11:05,908 --> 02:11:09,828
- Who's that couple?
- Oh, Henry and Elizabeth.

692
02:11:10,871 --> 02:11:14,541
- The Emperor of China?
- The ex-Emperor and his wife.

693
02:11:16,919 --> 02:11:20,088
- She's beautiful.
- Yes, very.

694
02:11:20,214 --> 02:11:21,690
And who are you?

695
02:11:22,090 --> 02:11:24,051
I'm His Highness's other wife.

696
02:11:24,176 --> 02:11:27,137
- His other wife?
- Number two wife.

697
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:30,724
Well, some people have the luck.

698
02:11:47,115 --> 02:11:48,992
Ladies and gentlemen!

699
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:56,291
General Chiang Kai Shek
has taken Shanghai!

700
02:11:56,708 --> 02:12:01,588
The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds
and have knocked them for six!

701
02:12:01,713 --> 02:12:03,090
The Reds are finished!

702
02:12:10,514 --> 02:12:11,974
Sorry about the reception, everyone!

703
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:17,437
It would be wiser to return to the Japanese
delegation now, Your Majesty.

704
02:12:17,563 --> 02:12:20,607
- Your car is waiting.
- Thank you, Mr. Amakasu.

705
02:12:34,162 --> 02:12:37,499
The general strike in Shanghai
has collapsed.

706
02:12:38,458 --> 02:12:41,336
The international settlement is safe.

707
02:12:42,421 --> 02:12:46,592
Troops of the Kuomintang
are now in full control of the city.

708
02:12:46,717 --> 02:12:52,389
And firm steps are being taken to
restore order in the native areas.

709
02:13:14,912 --> 02:13:17,414
What do you think of General
Chiang Kai Shek?

710
02:13:17,539 --> 02:13:21,418
What should I think of him?
He's just another warlord.

711
02:13:21,543 --> 02:13:24,213
Well, he has mashed
the Communists.

712
02:13:24,338 --> 02:13:30,344
That's good. Except the Communists were
his sworn allies until a few days ago.

713
02:13:31,345 --> 02:13:33,555
I expect he betrayed them
for money.

714
02:13:34,723 --> 02:13:36,975
- You want some gum, Elizabeth?
- Uh-huh.

715
02:13:46,026 --> 02:13:49,154
Wen Hsiu, you want some gum?

716
02:13:52,991 --> 02:13:54,701
I want a divorce.

717
02:14:08,674 --> 02:14:11,593
I do not want to be your
mistress any longer.

718
02:14:11,718 --> 02:14:14,221
I thought you were my
secondary consort.

719
02:14:14,346 --> 02:14:19,268
In the Forbidden City, you were the
Emperor and I was a secondary consort.

720
02:14:20,018 --> 02:14:22,354
But now you are Henry Pu Yi.

721
02:14:22,479 --> 02:14:25,774
Wan Jung is your wife, Elizabeth.

722
02:14:27,568 --> 02:14:32,865
And who am I? I'm nobody.

723
02:14:44,459 --> 02:14:46,962
I did not know you were so unhappy.

724
02:14:52,217 --> 02:14:54,928
You can only have one wife
in the West.

725
02:15:00,767 --> 02:15:02,352
I want a divorce.

726
02:15:02,477 --> 02:15:04,521
No one can divorce me!

727
02:15:31,965 --> 02:15:33,759
I want a divorce!

728
02:15:45,896 --> 02:15:47,314
Come inside with me?

729
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:48,941
Leave me alone.

730
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:28,730
Your Ladyship!

731
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:36,530
Thank you.

732
02:16:51,587 --> 02:16:52,963
I do not need it!

733
02:16:57,593 --> 02:16:58,969
I do not need it!

734
02:17:29,374 --> 02:17:30,751
Wen Hsiu?

735
02:17:41,929 --> 02:17:43,972
Elizabeth! Can I come in?

736
02:17:44,806 --> 02:17:50,270
Don't you remember me? I'm dressed like
a pilot, but I still can't fly! Not yet.

737
02:17:50,395 --> 02:17:53,649
Eastern Jewel!
We had dancing classes together!

738
02:17:53,774 --> 02:17:55,651
Yes, just before your marriage.

739
02:17:56,068 --> 02:17:58,987
Silly girl!
Why do people want to get married?

740
02:17:59,863 --> 02:18:04,493
Wen Hsiu has gone.
She will never come back.

741
02:18:04,618 --> 02:18:06,094
Is it so bad?

742
02:18:07,663 --> 02:18:09,164
She was my only friend.

743
02:18:11,083 --> 02:18:14,211
Well, at least now you've got
your husband all to yourself!

744
02:18:16,338 --> 02:18:17,714
And you've got me!

745
02:18:19,716 --> 02:18:21,460
I'll be your friend.

746
02:18:22,261 --> 02:18:24,220
- You smoke opium?
- Be wicked.

747
02:18:24,345 --> 02:18:29,643
It's the best in Shanghai!
Why are you going to Europe?

748
02:18:29,768 --> 02:18:33,522
The place to go is Japan!
It's more fun than anywhere!

749
02:18:34,773 --> 02:18:36,149
It's modern.

750
02:18:37,693 --> 02:18:40,904
How do you know we're going
to Europe? It is a secret.

751
02:18:41,029 --> 02:18:42,823
Oh, I know everything!

752
02:18:43,782 --> 02:18:47,286
I know Chiang Kai Shek has got false teeth.

753
02:18:47,870 --> 02:18:50,372
I even know his nickname,
"cash my check!"

754
02:18:54,751 --> 02:18:59,173
I'm a spy. And I don't
care who knows it.

755
02:18:59,298 --> 02:19:00,632
A spy?

756
02:19:00,757 --> 02:19:02,968
I work for the Japanese
Special Service Bureau,

757
02:19:03,510 --> 02:19:05,387
and I've come to protect you.

758
02:19:07,055 --> 02:19:12,436
The Japanese. They are getting
closer to him every day.

759
02:19:13,812 --> 02:19:17,691
He is sending his brother to the
military academy in Tokyo.

760
02:19:17,816 --> 02:19:21,028
They talk to him about
Manchuria all the time.

761
02:19:22,571 --> 02:19:25,490
And Mr. Amakasu
never says hello to me.

762
02:19:25,908 --> 02:19:27,701
I do not trust the Japanese.

763
02:19:54,895 --> 02:19:57,523
Of course, I'd love to be the
Emperor's new secondary consort!

764
02:19:57,648 --> 02:19:59,024
Eastern Jewel.

765
02:19:59,358 --> 02:20:00,943
If the post is available.

766
02:20:19,753 --> 02:20:22,256
The post is vacant,
my dear cousin.

767
02:20:24,716 --> 02:20:26,468
But you do not fit the part!

768
02:20:30,055 --> 02:20:32,349
Wen Hsiu left the dog behind.
Do you want it?

769
02:20:35,310 --> 02:20:39,356
It is my fault.
It is all my fault.

770
02:21:11,847 --> 02:21:17,144
I came to see you, Your Majesty,
to give you bad news.

771
02:21:18,270 --> 02:21:19,813
Something terrible has happened.

772
02:21:26,069 --> 02:21:32,201
The Imperial tombs of our Manchurian
ancestors have been attacked and robbed

773
02:21:32,326 --> 02:21:36,830
by troops of the Kuomintang.
Chinese soldiers.

774
02:21:37,331 --> 02:21:40,000
A warlord working for
Chiang Kai Shek.

775
02:21:43,504 --> 02:21:49,134
The body of the Empress Dowager
was hacked to pieces.

776
02:21:50,844 --> 02:21:53,965
Her pearl necklace
has become a wedding

777
02:21:53,991 --> 02:21:57,501
present from Chiang Kai
Shek to his new wife.

778
02:22:20,415 --> 02:22:22,918
Prisoner 981 reporting.

779
02:22:23,043 --> 02:22:24,419
Open the door!

780
02:22:27,714 --> 02:22:29,091
Close the door!

781
02:22:37,850 --> 02:22:41,061
Tell me, 981. Do you consider
yourself to be Chinese?

782
02:22:41,186 --> 02:22:43,146
- Of course.
- What is this?

783
02:22:43,272 --> 02:22:44,648
Japan.

784
02:22:44,815 --> 02:22:46,441
And what do you call this part
of China?

785
02:22:46,567 --> 02:22:49,111
- The Northeast.   - And what did
you call it as a child?

786
02:22:49,236 --> 02:22:50,612
Manchuria.

787
02:22:51,071 --> 02:22:54,950
Japan invaded Manchuria on
September eighteenth, 1931

788
02:22:55,075 --> 02:22:57,911
and began to set up a puppet
state called Manchukuo.

789
02:22:58,036 --> 02:23:02,749
Shortly afterwards, a Japanese delegation
paid you a secret visit in Tientsin

790
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:05,627
to request your collaboration,
which you say you refused.

791
02:23:05,752 --> 02:23:07,129
Speak up!

792
02:23:07,838 --> 02:23:10,299
I've already told you.
I have told you a hundred times.

793
02:23:10,424 --> 02:23:12,176
Tell us again! Tell us
two hundred times!

794
02:23:12,301 --> 02:23:14,178
I refused to collaborate.

795
02:23:14,303 --> 02:23:19,600
You say you refused, but a month
later, on November tenth, 1931,

796
02:23:19,725 --> 02:23:23,812
there you are arriving in Manchuria,
or should I call it Manchukuo?

797
02:23:24,104 --> 02:23:26,667
Now, according to this
so-called confession of

798
02:23:26,693 --> 02:23:29,092
yours, you didn't go
of your own free will!

799
02:23:29,193 --> 02:23:31,778
You insist that you were
kidnapped by the Japanese!

800
02:23:31,904 --> 02:23:33,989
- Yes.
- And taken to Manchuria by force!

801
02:23:34,114 --> 02:23:36,283
- Yes!
- Sit down!

802
02:23:39,119 --> 02:23:43,040
Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?

803
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:45,951
He was your tutor.

804
02:23:46,919 --> 02:23:48,420
Yes.

805
02:23:48,837 --> 02:23:51,381
And a good friend, I believe.

806
02:23:53,217 --> 02:23:58,514
After twenty-eight years in China,
Mr. Johnston returned to England.

807
02:23:59,139 --> 02:24:04,478
He became a professor of Oriental
studies at London University,

808
02:24:04,811 --> 02:24:12,110
and he wrote a book. It is called
Twilight in the Forbidden City,

809
02:24:12,236 --> 02:24:14,863
and it is dedicated to you.

810
02:24:42,349 --> 02:24:44,309
I am going to miss you,
Johnston.

811
02:24:44,434 --> 02:24:46,395
I shall miss you, Your Majesty.

812
02:24:54,027 --> 02:24:58,532
Do you think a man can
become Emperor again?

813
02:24:59,324 --> 02:25:00,701
Yes.

814
02:25:23,348 --> 02:25:25,184
Thank you, Your Majesty.

815
02:25:35,027 --> 02:25:36,778
How can we say "Good-bye"?

816
02:25:38,822 --> 02:25:40,782
As we said, "Hello."

817
02:25:53,170 --> 02:25:55,130
Farewell, Mr. Johnston.

818
02:25:55,255 --> 02:25:57,591
Farewell, Your Majesty.

819
02:26:04,056 --> 02:26:08,268
All aboard! All aboard!

820
02:26:10,145 --> 02:26:11,522
Thank you, sir.

821
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:52,896
Good-bye, Mr. Johnston!
We'll never forget you, Mr. Johnston.

822
02:26:53,146 --> 02:26:58,318
Good-bye! Mr. Johnston!
Good-bye! Good-bye!

823
02:26:58,443 --> 02:27:00,612
All aboard!

824
02:27:02,865 --> 02:27:09,454
On page four-hundred
and forty-nine, Mr. Johnston writes,

825
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:13,356
The endeavor to make out
that the Emperor had

826
02:27:13,382 --> 02:27:17,404
been kidnapped by the
Japanese is wholly untrue.

827
02:27:18,839 --> 02:27:22,759
He left Tientsin and went to
Manchuria of his own free will.

828
02:27:22,885 --> 02:27:24,386
Johnston was a liar!

829
02:27:25,262 --> 02:27:28,557
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.

830
02:27:28,682 --> 02:27:33,103
Mr. Johnston had left before
I was taken to Manchuria.

831
02:27:33,687 --> 02:27:35,772
He could not have known
what happened.

832
02:27:55,834 --> 02:27:57,211
Sit down!

833
02:28:05,886 --> 02:28:08,722
Is this your confession, 895?

834
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:11,907
- Yes.
- According to this account,

835
02:28:12,032 --> 02:28:14,603
you prepared the man's things
on the morning of November ninth!

836
02:28:14,728 --> 02:28:18,357
Isn't it unusual for a man who's kidnapped
to have his luggage packed

837
02:28:18,482 --> 02:28:20,901
by his valet the day
before he's kidnapped?

838
02:28:22,110 --> 02:28:24,071
This is what you've written,
isn't it?

839
02:28:24,696 --> 02:28:27,866
Who told you to pack this man's luggage?

840
02:28:30,744 --> 02:28:34,039
These two stories don't fit,
do they?

841
02:28:35,290 --> 02:28:40,295
It was a long time ago.
Perhaps I made a mistake.

842
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:42,005
You are lying!

843
02:28:42,130 --> 02:28:43,966
You are both lying!

844
02:28:44,091 --> 02:28:45,467
Control yourself!

845
02:28:49,346 --> 02:28:53,100
My family was buried alive
in Manchukuo.

846
02:28:54,852 --> 02:28:59,731
My mother digged her own grave
because of people like them.

847
02:29:00,524 --> 02:29:03,986
Smash the enemies.
Smash them forever.

848
02:29:04,111 --> 02:29:05,487
Enough.

849
02:29:25,716 --> 02:29:28,468
These might help you
to remember the truth.

850
02:29:56,455 --> 02:29:58,332
What made you write that?

851
02:29:59,958 --> 02:30:01,627
It is the truth.

852
02:30:17,684 --> 02:30:19,853
Chen Pao Shen wishes you a safe journey.

853
02:30:20,854 --> 02:30:23,524
You mean he refuses to say
goodbye to me.

854
02:30:24,566 --> 02:30:27,277
He will see me when he comes
to my coronation.

855
02:30:29,071 --> 02:30:33,075
Request a truce.
In case you change your mind.

856
02:30:36,495 --> 02:30:41,166
I am the hereditary ruler of the
Manchurian people.

857
02:30:43,502 --> 02:30:47,047
There can be no Manchukuo
without me.

858
02:30:48,048 --> 02:30:51,718
Do you not see?
The Japanese are using you.

859
02:30:52,553 --> 02:30:54,471
I must try to use them.

860
02:30:55,347 --> 02:30:59,560
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria will be
condemned by the League of Nations

861
02:30:59,685 --> 02:31:01,895
and by every civilized
country on earth!

862
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:05,315
The Chinese Republic has broken every
promise it ever made to me!

863
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:08,902
Chinese troops desecrated
the tombs of my ancestors!

864
02:31:09,027 --> 02:31:12,573
And Chinese troops did not defend
Manchuria from the Japanese!

865
02:31:12,698 --> 02:31:15,117
But Manchuria is still China!

866
02:31:15,242 --> 02:31:17,286
China has turned its back
on me.

867
02:31:17,411 --> 02:31:19,121
Please, do not go.

868
02:31:19,246 --> 02:31:22,249
Manchuria is the richest
frontier in Asia!

869
02:31:22,374 --> 02:31:24,835
Coal, oil, railways!

870
02:31:25,252 --> 02:31:28,547
Millions of Chinese immigrants
are going there every year!

871
02:31:28,881 --> 02:31:30,799
I'm going to build my country.

872
02:31:40,475 --> 02:31:42,936
Chen Pao Shen: If you go, you
betray your country.

873
02:31:46,648 --> 02:31:48,025
Which country?

874
02:31:51,612 --> 02:31:54,239
Johnston was wrong,
but he wasn't a liar.

875
02:31:54,781 --> 02:31:56,783
There was no kidnapping!

876
02:31:57,159 --> 02:32:01,622
You went to Manchuria by your own choice,
because you wanted to be Emperor again!

877
02:32:03,624 --> 02:32:08,045
You will rewrite your confessions
from the beginning!

878
02:32:08,629 --> 02:32:10,005
Guard!

879
02:32:10,839 --> 02:32:12,299
Take these people away!

880
02:32:15,802 --> 02:32:17,179
Out!

881
02:34:37,778 --> 02:34:39,279
To heaven.

882
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:48,247
To earth.

883
02:34:51,458 --> 02:34:56,755
Chen Pao Shen is a fool. How could he
miss the birth of a new country?

884
02:35:00,133 --> 02:35:03,595
It looks like the
inauguration of a factory.

885
02:35:04,805 --> 02:35:06,306
To the moon.

886
02:35:10,811 --> 02:35:12,729
To the sun.

887
02:35:37,379 --> 02:35:39,006
You're an empress again.

888
02:35:40,799 --> 02:35:42,801
What I'm going to be is a pilot!

889
02:35:43,218 --> 02:35:47,472
I'm going to train at a secret base near
Yokohama to learn precision bombing.

890
02:35:48,849 --> 02:35:51,518
I want to bomb Shanghai.

891
02:35:52,603 --> 02:35:54,313
Bomb Shanghai?

892
02:35:54,438 --> 02:35:56,148
I hate China!

893
02:36:02,946 --> 02:36:04,823
I hate you.

894
02:38:02,649 --> 02:38:04,526
The Japanese Army High Command!

895
02:38:04,651 --> 02:38:06,111
Very impressive!

896
02:38:07,321 --> 02:38:10,115
The Japanese Army!

897
02:38:20,209 --> 02:38:21,585
Quickly!

898
02:38:40,062 --> 02:38:44,525
On behalf of the Emperor of Japan,
the commander of the Kantong Army

899
02:38:44,650 --> 02:38:50,364
extends his warmest congratulations on the
occasion of His Majesty's coronation.

900
02:39:41,832 --> 02:39:44,209
Manchukuo will grow into a bright vision.

901
02:39:44,585 --> 02:39:48,005
Japan will always be on
the side of the Emperor.

902
02:40:52,486 --> 02:40:57,282
Uh, may I introduce you?
My wife, the Princess Hiro Saga.

903
02:40:57,991 --> 02:40:59,785
Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu.

904
02:41:05,916 --> 02:41:08,752
Honorable Chang Chinghui,
Minister of Defense.

905
02:41:10,170 --> 02:41:12,798
The monseigneur,
Monseigneur Colonna.

906
02:41:28,188 --> 02:41:31,483
The Empress and I accept with
great pleasure.

907
02:41:38,866 --> 02:41:40,242
Excuse me, General.

908
02:42:03,849 --> 02:42:07,692
Ahh! And now Mr. Amakasu.
He's the new chief

909
02:42:07,718 --> 02:42:11,048
of the Manchuria
Motion Picture Studio.

910
02:42:21,074 --> 02:42:25,204
Why do you have to spoil this day? Why?

911
02:42:27,623 --> 02:42:32,294
Mr. Amakasu is the most
powerful man in Manchukuo.

912
02:42:32,836 --> 02:42:34,796
What are you talking about?

913
02:42:35,964 --> 02:42:39,801
You did not believe I could be
Emperor again, but I am.

914
02:42:40,385 --> 02:42:42,179
You are blind.

915
02:42:52,439 --> 02:42:53,982
Do you know what it means
to be an empress?

916
02:42:54,107 --> 02:42:55,484
You are an empress!

917
02:43:00,447 --> 02:43:02,449
Why do you not make love to
me anymore?

918
02:43:02,574 --> 02:43:04,743
Because you have become an
opium addict.

919
02:43:05,494 --> 02:43:09,748
Opium killed my mother.
Opium destroyed China.

920
02:43:09,873 --> 02:43:12,292
You can buy opium anywhere
in Manchukuo!

921
02:43:12,417 --> 02:43:13,877
- Shut up!
- In any shop.

922
02:43:14,002 --> 02:43:15,379
Shut up!

923
02:43:19,216 --> 02:43:21,510
Your brother is going
to have a child.

924
02:43:24,429 --> 02:43:29,601
We must have a child.
We must have an heir.

925
02:43:31,311 --> 02:43:35,732
Emperor Hirohito has officially
invited us to Japan.

926
02:43:36,441 --> 02:43:40,529
I'm going alone.
You are staying here.

927
02:43:43,115 --> 02:43:44,950
I would never go to Japan.

928
02:43:45,075 --> 02:43:46,451
Then go to your room!

929
02:43:54,334 --> 02:43:57,880
Ten thousand years to
His Majesty, the Emperor!

930
02:43:59,506 --> 02:44:03,218
Ten thousand years!

931
02:44:03,343 --> 02:44:06,096
Ten thousand years to His Majesty!

932
02:44:07,472 --> 02:44:09,391
To His Majesty, ten thousand years!

933
02:45:20,128 --> 02:45:22,798
I told you, I hate you.

934
02:45:25,592 --> 02:45:27,761
Only because I give you what you need.

935
02:46:03,505 --> 02:46:05,090
Now we're engaged.

936
02:46:36,163 --> 02:46:38,290
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

937
02:46:50,302 --> 02:46:52,346
Good morning, sir.

938
02:47:42,521 --> 02:47:43,981
You forgot my toothpowder.

939
02:47:44,106 --> 02:47:47,234
Oh... yes, sir.

940
02:48:06,712 --> 02:48:08,088
Move him!

941
02:48:13,260 --> 02:48:15,637
981!
Collect your things!

942
02:48:19,183 --> 02:48:21,226
I said, collect your things!

943
02:48:44,124 --> 02:48:46,335
Keep to the story.
That is an order.

944
02:49:03,435 --> 02:49:04,811
Upstairs!

945
02:49:09,399 --> 02:49:10,776
Stop!

946
02:49:19,243 --> 02:49:26,458
Your laces are undone.
Do them up!

947
02:49:31,630 --> 02:49:33,048
Thursday, you serve lunch.

948
02:49:33,173 --> 02:49:34,633
Friday, you clean the toilet.

949
02:49:34,758 --> 02:49:36,760
Saturday, you sweep the floor.

950
02:50:05,038 --> 02:50:07,583
I have never been separated
from my family.

951
02:50:07,708 --> 02:50:09,626
You'd better get used to it!

952
02:50:25,976 --> 02:50:30,439
It's not so bad.
People get used to anything.

953
02:50:30,564 --> 02:50:33,066
You do not remember me, do you?

954
02:50:40,574 --> 02:50:44,203
I was the Minister of Trade,
in Manchukuo.

955
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:50,000
You were all in Manchukuo.

956
02:50:50,125 --> 02:50:51,793
Now I'm the cell leader.

957
02:50:51,919 --> 02:50:54,463
It is important to follow the rules here.

958
02:50:54,588 --> 02:50:57,090
No talking during study sessions!

959
02:52:00,988 --> 02:52:04,533
Where is your gun, Captain?
Where are their swords?

960
02:52:04,658 --> 02:52:07,240
Our weapons have
been removed, Your

961
02:52:07,266 --> 02:52:10,063
Majesty, on orders
of Colonel Yoshioka.

962
02:52:10,163 --> 02:52:12,124
Colonel Yoshioka?

963
02:52:14,001 --> 02:52:15,502
Colonel Yoshioka!

964
02:52:16,003 --> 02:52:19,464
What has happened here?
Why has my guard been disarmed?

965
02:52:19,590 --> 02:52:22,342
Yes, it is very unfortunate, Your Majesty.

966
02:52:22,467 --> 02:52:25,512
There have been many
changes while you were in Tokyo.

967
02:52:25,637 --> 02:52:29,236
Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa,

968
02:52:29,262 --> 02:52:32,336
the new Japanese
Ambassador to Manchukuo.

969
02:52:59,004 --> 02:53:02,007
Why is Prime Minister Hsiao
Hsiu not here to receive me?

970
02:53:02,132 --> 02:53:05,260
The Prime Minister has resigned,
Your Majesty.

971
02:53:05,385 --> 02:53:07,846
His son has been assassinated.

972
02:53:08,388 --> 02:53:12,893
- Assassinated?
- By communist bandits, Your Majesty.

973
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:21,777
I must see him at once.

974
02:53:21,902 --> 02:53:29,535
He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty.
He has gone to a monastery, far away.

975
02:53:36,917 --> 02:53:38,293
Who are you?

976
02:53:39,294 --> 02:53:44,466
Chang Chinghui, Your Majesty,
Minister of Defense.

977
02:53:45,634 --> 02:53:47,203
Yes.

978
02:53:49,410 --> 02:53:51,303
Of course.

979
02:53:53,392 --> 02:53:56,095
The council meeting will
be at four o'clock,

980
02:53:56,121 --> 02:53:58,463
Your Majesty, before
the state dinner.

981
02:54:09,283 --> 02:54:13,036
The Emperor has been asked to
sign the following.

982
02:54:14,037 --> 02:54:16,164
After careful consideration,

983
02:54:16,290 --> 02:54:19,716
we have decided to nominate
the Honorable Chang

984
02:54:19,742 --> 02:54:23,238
Chinghui as the new Prime
Minister of Manchukuo.

985
02:54:31,805 --> 02:54:33,473
No.

986
02:54:34,474 --> 02:54:39,813
Today, on our return from Japan, we wish
to speak of something more important.

987
02:54:40,814 --> 02:54:45,194
The future of our friendship with Japan.

988
02:54:45,319 --> 02:54:47,529
This is based on mutual respect,

989
02:54:48,488 --> 02:54:52,868
and respect means equality
and independence.

990
02:54:52,993 --> 02:54:57,664
When the two Emperors stood together
and saluted the two national flags,

991
02:54:57,789 --> 02:55:01,293
they recognized that Manchukuo
had come of age.

992
02:55:01,418 --> 02:55:05,631
Manchukuo is not a colony.
Manchukuo is Manchuria.

993
02:55:09,009 --> 02:55:11,507
The relationship between
our two countries is

994
02:55:11,533 --> 02:55:14,248
like the relationship
between these two Emperors.

995
02:55:14,348 --> 02:55:17,518
It is rooted in paternal trust,

996
02:55:17,643 --> 02:55:22,731
in... in the desire to preserve
our ancient traditions,

997
02:55:22,856 --> 02:55:27,986
and in a mutual respect for
our national identities.

998
02:55:28,111 --> 02:55:34,993
Already, we have welcomed the ambassadors
of El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Vatican...

999
02:55:37,037 --> 02:55:41,166
Soon I'm... I'm sure the other
countries will follow.

1000
02:56:02,062 --> 02:56:05,774
Chang Chinghui was an idiot.

1001
02:56:05,899 --> 02:56:11,280
He thought the open board were there
to decrease production.

1002
02:56:11,405 --> 02:56:15,033
But that was just propaganda.

1003
02:56:15,158 --> 02:56:20,664
What the Japanese really wanted
was cash, more production!

1004
02:56:20,914 --> 02:56:23,417
Of course, they've gotten rid of him.

1005
02:56:25,586 --> 02:56:33,586
Well, I had been in the drug business
all my life... opium, heroin.

1006
02:56:34,595 --> 02:56:37,927
I could deal with
the green gang in

1007
02:56:37,953 --> 02:56:41,376
Shanghai, even with
Chiang Kai Shek.

1008
02:56:42,102 --> 02:56:48,066
That is why the Japanese wanted
me to be Prime Minister.

1009
02:57:14,843 --> 02:57:18,931
You were right.
I was blind.

1010
02:57:39,451 --> 02:57:47,376
I'm going to have a child.
The father is Manchurian.

1011
02:57:52,756 --> 02:57:54,716
Colonel Yoshioka, Mr. Amakasu!

1012
02:57:54,842 --> 02:57:56,677
I did it for you!

1013
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:22,834
His Majesty forgot to
sign the appointment of

1014
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:25,856
the new Prime Minister,
Mr. Chang Chinghui!

1015
02:58:27,833 --> 02:58:29,209
I did not forget.

1016
02:58:35,716 --> 02:58:39,636
When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty, he becomes a gentleman.

1017
02:58:39,761 --> 02:58:43,140
If he robs a lot, he becomes a knight.

1018
02:58:44,057 --> 02:58:47,936
Do you imagine the British run
their Empire as a charity?

1019
02:58:48,312 --> 02:58:55,611
If India has to pay for the cost of its own
occupation, so must Manchukuo.

1020
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:18,250
We hope Manchukuo will have an heir.
The Empress is expecting a child.

1021
02:59:19,259 --> 02:59:27,142
Yes, Your Majesty,
we are aware of the situation.

1022
02:59:29,061 --> 02:59:30,812
This is the name of the father.

1023
02:59:45,702 --> 02:59:48,997
His name is Chang!
He is your driver!

1024
03:00:08,642 --> 03:00:13,689
All the necessary facts have been recorded.
The man will be punished.

1025
03:00:13,814 --> 03:00:17,150
The Emperor cannot allow
his honor to be stained.

1026
03:00:34,543 --> 03:00:38,422
The Japanese are the only
divine race on earth.

1027
03:00:38,547 --> 03:00:43,510
We will take China,
Hong Kong, Indochina,

1028
03:00:43,635 --> 03:00:48,849
Siam, Malaya,
Singapore, and India!

1029
03:00:49,308 --> 03:00:51,518
Asia belongs to us!

1030
03:01:47,032 --> 03:01:49,076
How long have you been here?

1031
03:01:49,493 --> 03:01:50,869
Three years.

1032
03:01:53,288 --> 03:01:58,126
You were issued with the same
clothes as everyone else.

1033
03:01:58,710 --> 03:02:02,339
Why can't you learn to look
after yourself?

1034
03:02:05,592 --> 03:02:08,053
There have been complaints
from your cellmates.

1035
03:02:08,762 --> 03:02:12,474
You must learn how to urinate
at night without waking them all up!

1036
03:02:14,893 --> 03:02:18,544
The way to do it is to
urinate against the

1037
03:02:18,570 --> 03:02:22,050
side of the bucket,
not into the middle!

1038
03:02:22,484 --> 03:02:23,861
Yes, comrade.

1039
03:02:38,375 --> 03:02:41,044
You still think I'm your
servant, don't you?

1040
03:03:17,331 --> 03:03:20,459
This is the last time, the last time.

1041
03:03:41,647 --> 03:03:43,524
This is the last time.

1042
03:03:51,657 --> 03:03:55,410
Why do you think Big Li has been
in prison all this time?

1043
03:03:58,622 --> 03:04:00,832
Or haven't you thought about it?

1044
03:04:02,042 --> 03:04:03,877
Because he was my servant.

1045
03:04:04,002 --> 03:04:05,379
Yes.

1046
03:04:06,380 --> 03:04:09,299
Loyalty is a great quality, isn't it?

1047
03:04:09,800 --> 03:04:14,888
So do you think it is unjust that your
loyal servant is punished for serving you?

1048
03:04:15,889 --> 03:04:19,268
I think it is not a question of justice.

1049
03:04:19,393 --> 03:04:21,270
It is a question of justice!

1050
03:04:21,395 --> 03:04:23,939
Even the servant has a choice.

1051
03:04:24,064 --> 03:04:27,943
Maybe he had nothing to do with
the political decisions of Manchukuo

1052
03:04:28,068 --> 03:04:30,445
or the crimes that happened
around me.

1053
03:04:30,571 --> 03:04:32,823
He was the only innocent person there.

1054
03:04:34,241 --> 03:04:35,617
Sit down.

1055
03:04:43,625 --> 03:04:48,338
Carmen Li is now a free citizen
of the People's Republic of China.

1056
03:04:48,922 --> 03:04:50,632
He is being released today.

1057
03:04:53,802 --> 03:04:55,470
You have a train to catch.

1058
03:05:00,601 --> 03:05:04,229
This is my wife.
We had three children.

1059
03:05:08,066 --> 03:05:09,860
You know nothing about me.

1060
03:05:27,544 --> 03:05:28,921
Thank you.

1061
03:05:29,463 --> 03:05:31,381
For a long time, I thought you kept
him in prison,

1062
03:05:31,507 --> 03:05:33,926
because you wanted
someone to look after me.

1063
03:05:34,635 --> 03:05:38,931
If you went out on the streets of China
today, and people knew who you were,

1064
03:05:39,056 --> 03:05:42,184
somebody would probably try
to kill you!

1065
03:05:43,977 --> 03:05:48,190
You talk of your past as if you were
the only one who suffered.

1066
03:05:48,315 --> 03:05:51,109
Stop hiding behind
your private story.

1067
03:05:51,235 --> 03:05:54,071
Write it again! All of it.

1068
03:06:08,919 --> 03:06:13,382
We are all pretending. You are
just pretending you have changed.

1069
03:06:13,507 --> 03:06:16,176
You cannot speak like that in here.

1070
03:06:16,593 --> 03:06:19,471
That is counter-revolutionary talk.

1071
03:06:19,596 --> 03:06:22,474
I know who you all are.

1072
03:06:23,350 --> 03:06:25,936
You were a captain of
the Imperial Guard,

1073
03:06:26,061 --> 03:06:28,856
and you become a spy
in the palace.

1074
03:06:28,981 --> 03:06:31,900
You, the Minister of Trade,

1075
03:06:32,025 --> 03:06:35,904
were responsible for the starvation
in Manchukuo.

1076
03:06:36,029 --> 03:06:41,285
He...
Prime Minister of Narcotics.

1077
03:06:42,202 --> 03:06:44,454
Shut up! The party teaches
us to be new men!

1078
03:06:44,580 --> 03:06:46,081
We're working for a new China!

1079
03:06:46,206 --> 03:06:48,250
You worked in Amakasu's private office.

1080
03:06:48,375 --> 03:06:52,004
You are still the same people!
People do not change.

1081
03:06:52,504 --> 03:06:54,840
Guard! Guard!

1082
03:07:00,804 --> 03:07:02,181
Guard!

1083
03:07:02,639 --> 03:07:04,141
I let it happen.

1084
03:07:04,892 --> 03:07:07,311
Guard! Guard!

1085
03:07:07,436 --> 03:07:09,021
I let it happen.

1086
03:07:44,806 --> 03:07:47,797
The second edict, Your Majesty.
Japanese will

1087
03:07:47,823 --> 03:07:50,879
be the official language
in Manchukuo schools.

1088
03:08:04,535 --> 03:08:05,911
Your Majesty!

1089
03:08:10,457 --> 03:08:12,626
The baby was born dead, Your Majesty.

1090
03:08:12,751 --> 03:08:14,419
How is the Empress?

1091
03:08:14,545 --> 03:08:18,131
It would be better if she goes
to a clinic, somewhere warm.

1092
03:08:23,637 --> 03:08:26,056
She's already left,
Your Majesty.

1093
03:09:20,819 --> 03:09:22,404
Open the door.

1094
03:10:40,482 --> 03:10:43,652
With Manchukuo now firmly
in their grasp, the

1095
03:10:43,678 --> 03:10:46,847
Japanese soon controlled
most of North China.

1096
03:10:47,239 --> 03:10:52,786
By 1937, they were ready to strike South,
at the heart of the country.

1097
03:10:53,453 --> 03:10:58,584
The attack on Shanghai was one of the
first civilian bombing raids in history.

1098
03:10:58,959 --> 03:11:03,213
It left thousands homeless,
thousands dead.

1099
03:11:08,635 --> 03:11:11,131
Three months later,
Japanese armies were

1100
03:11:11,157 --> 03:11:13,957
besieging the provisional
capital at Nanking.

1101
03:11:14,057 --> 03:11:18,854
And when the city fell,
the atrocities began.

1102
03:11:19,479 --> 03:11:22,149
Trying to terrorize
the rest of China into surrender,

1103
03:11:22,274 --> 03:11:26,528
the Japanese High Command
ordered a massacre.

1104
03:11:26,653 --> 03:11:32,117
More than two hundred thousand
civilians were systematically executed.

1105
03:11:32,409 --> 03:11:36,997
The world watched in horror,
but no help was given.

1106
03:11:37,122 --> 03:11:40,415
On December the
seventh, 1941, Japan

1107
03:11:40,441 --> 03:11:44,446
attacked the American
fleet at Pearl Harbor.

1108
03:11:44,671 --> 03:11:46,798
There was no warning.

1109
03:11:47,841 --> 03:11:51,926
Manchukuo, the Japanese
bastion in North China,

1110
03:11:51,952 --> 03:11:55,866
was still ruled by the
puppet Emperor, Pu Yi.

1111
03:11:56,725 --> 03:12:02,272
But behind the facade of triumph
was a country enslaved.

1112
03:12:02,856 --> 03:12:06,980
A country where Japanese
experimenting biological

1113
03:12:07,006 --> 03:12:10,881
warfare were carried out
on live human beings.

1114
03:12:11,865 --> 03:12:18,413
A country where opium production became
the easiest way to finance the war.

1115
03:12:18,539 --> 03:12:24,002
Millions of people were deliberately
turned into drug addicts.

1116
03:12:48,569 --> 03:12:55,242
Nine days after the bomb at Hiroshima,
on August the fifteenth, 1945,

1117
03:12:55,367 --> 03:12:59,746
Emperor Hirohito announced
the surrender of Japan.

1118
03:13:00,247 --> 03:13:05,627
It was the first time his voice
had ever been heard on radio.

1119
03:13:55,177 --> 03:13:56,970
You must get to Tokyo, Your Majesty.

1120
03:13:57,095 --> 03:13:59,848
You must surrender to
the Americans, not the Russians.

1121
03:13:59,973 --> 03:14:01,934
The communists will kill everyone!

1122
03:14:11,693 --> 03:14:13,779
Your excellence have reached Habi.

1123
03:14:14,363 --> 03:14:16,114
We must leave at once.

1124
03:14:18,116 --> 03:14:20,160
There is no room in the plane.

1125
03:14:20,994 --> 03:14:22,496
No trucks!

1126
03:15:17,384 --> 03:15:18,886
The Empress has returned.

1127
03:15:28,562 --> 03:15:30,147
Your Majesty, please.

1128
03:15:30,689 --> 03:15:34,109
The Empress must not know you
have seen her like that.

1129
03:15:40,115 --> 03:15:41,491
Your Majesty!

1130
03:16:35,600 --> 03:16:38,590
Hurry! There is no room on the plane,
Your Majesty!

1131
03:16:38,715 --> 03:16:41,802
The women are looking beat.
We must hurry!

1132
03:17:46,116 --> 03:17:48,952
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty is leaving now!

1133
03:17:50,370 --> 03:17:51,747
Now!

1134
03:18:29,868 --> 03:18:31,245
The Russians!

1135
03:19:45,611 --> 03:19:48,947
Perhaps you think we are here
to teach men to lie in a new way.

1136
03:19:51,658 --> 03:19:54,536
Why did you sign every
accusation made against you?

1137
03:19:55,162 --> 03:19:58,332
I didn't stop you from killing
yourself to see you like this.

1138
03:19:58,624 --> 03:20:02,961
Someone who signs anything to please
his enemies, to please me!

1139
03:20:04,338 --> 03:20:09,092
You knew about a lot of things in
Manchukuo, even the secret agreements.

1140
03:20:10,427 --> 03:20:13,107
But you couldn't possibly
have known about the

1141
03:20:13,133 --> 03:20:16,041
Japanese biological warfare
experiments in Harbin!

1142
03:20:16,642 --> 03:20:22,272
Could you? So why
did you sign these papers?

1143
03:20:27,069 --> 03:20:28,946
I was responsible for everything.

1144
03:20:29,655 --> 03:20:32,282
You are responsible for what you do!

1145
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:36,495
All your life you thought you were
better than everyone else.

1146
03:20:37,037 --> 03:20:38,789
Now you think you're the worst of all!

1147
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:47,422
Why can you not leave me
alone?

1148
03:20:49,383 --> 03:20:52,219
You saved my life to make me
a puppet in your own play.

1149
03:20:55,097 --> 03:20:57,349
You saved me because I am useful to you.

1150
03:20:57,766 --> 03:21:01,311
Is that so terrible, to be useful?

1151
03:21:34,845 --> 03:21:36,722
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi!

1152
03:21:42,186 --> 03:21:45,939
By order of the Supreme
People's Court,

1153
03:21:46,523 --> 03:21:53,655
the war criminal, Aisin-Gioro
Pu Yi, male, fifty-three years old,

1154
03:21:54,364 --> 03:21:58,577
of the Manchu nationality, and from Peking,

1155
03:21:59,036 --> 03:22:02,164
has now served
ten years detention!

1156
03:22:03,248 --> 03:22:11,248
As a result of remolding through labor and
ideological education during his captivity,

1157
03:22:11,507 --> 03:22:15,177
he has shown that he has
genuinely reformed!

1158
03:22:15,302 --> 03:22:19,258
In accordance with clause
one of the Special

1159
03:22:19,284 --> 03:22:23,327
Pardon Order, he is
therefore to be released!

1160
03:22:35,906 --> 03:22:40,661
You see, I will end up living in
prison longer than you.

1161
03:26:02,529 --> 03:26:03,989
The Red Guards!

1162
03:26:11,705 --> 03:26:13,165
They are so young.

1163
03:26:14,750 --> 03:26:16,376
It is dangerous.

1164
03:26:23,634 --> 03:26:26,845
Look, over there, Pu Chieh, look!

1165
03:26:30,682 --> 03:26:32,618
It is the governor of our prison!

1166
03:26:34,353 --> 03:26:37,356
- It cannot be!
- It is! I'm sure it is!

1167
03:26:40,275 --> 03:26:44,513
Be careful! Come back!

1168
03:27:29,658 --> 03:27:34,746
Comrade, this must be a mistake!
I know this man! He is a good man.

1169
03:27:35,706 --> 03:27:38,016
- Who are you?
- I am a gardener.

1170
03:27:38,792 --> 03:27:40,752
Join us, comrade, or buzz off!

1171
03:27:51,805 --> 03:27:53,849
- But what has he done?
- He has been accused.

1172
03:27:53,974 --> 03:27:58,645
- Accused of what?   - Imperialismania!
Reactionary elements! Traitor to country!

1173
03:27:59,563 --> 03:28:01,690
- Confess your crimes!
- I have nothing to confess.

1174
03:28:01,815 --> 03:28:03,667
Kowtow to Chairman Mao!

1175
03:28:08,822 --> 03:28:11,116
- Confess your crimes!
- I have nothing to confess.

1176
03:28:11,241 --> 03:28:12,618
Kowtow!

1177
03:28:17,122 --> 03:28:18,957
- Confess your crimes!
- Wait!

1178
03:28:19,124 --> 03:28:21,860
He's a teacher!
He is a good teacher!

1179
03:28:22,044 --> 03:28:24,713
- You! Get out of here!
- You can't do this to him!

1180
03:28:24,838 --> 03:28:26,340
Move!
You want to be him?

1181
03:28:26,465 --> 03:28:28,641
You are wrong!
He is a good teacher!

1182
03:28:43,190 --> 03:28:51,190
Decision of reactionary element!
Decision of reactionary element!

1183
03:32:12,566 --> 03:32:18,989
Stop!
You are not allowed in there!

1184
03:32:22,910 --> 03:32:26,246
- Who are you?   - I live here!
I'm the son of the guardian!

1185
03:32:26,663 --> 03:32:28,874
Ah, well, I used to live here, too.

1186
03:32:29,416 --> 03:32:30,876
That is where I sat.

1187
03:32:31,001 --> 03:32:32,544
Who are you?

1188
03:32:33,587 --> 03:32:35,714
I was the Emperor of China.

1189
03:32:35,839 --> 03:32:37,216
Prove it!

1190
03:34:25,365 --> 03:34:29,052
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony where
the Emperors were crowned.

1191
03:34:29,620 --> 03:34:32,748
The last Emperor to be crowned
here was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

1192
03:34:32,873 --> 03:34:38,503
He was three years old.
He died in 1967.

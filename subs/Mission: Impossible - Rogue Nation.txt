- Rendered safe by the IMF.DIRECTOR HUNLEY:

- This made possible by IMF agentswho did willingly provide

a new Secretary,you really can't say much of anything,
can you, Agent Brandt?Well, I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.DIRECTOR HUNLEY: Mr. Chairman,
the so-called Impossible Mission Forceis not just a rogue organization.It is an outdated one, a throwback
to an era without transparency- and without oversight.

- BRANDT: Mr. Chairman?...and transfer their salvageable assets
to the CIA.Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.- Mr. Chairman?

Absolutely.- But without the IMF...
- There will be order and stability!Without the IMF...This panel recognizes
the IMF's contribution to global security.But the events laid out

of wanton brinksmanshipand a total disregard for protocol.From where I sit,

<i>Less than 24 hours</i><i>after we interviewed Benji Dunn
about Ethan Hunt,</i>He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.Consider for the moment
the possibility thatEthan's investigation
led him to the opera,and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project.The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion.You mean shoot to kill.Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him.New identity.Passport, cash, move map.There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there.Everything you need
to make it to DC. undetected.Once you're there,
you have to inform on me.- I'm sorry, what?
- Just tell the truth.You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor.- You refused.
- That's not the truth!Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear.Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.You recognize anyone?Him.He's former KSA. German intelligence.Missing, presumed dead.He was at the opera tonight.This one, too.Former Mossad.Let me guess. Presumed dead.Tonight, I made it official.I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.The same day, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.He slipped away again in Jakarta,hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacificwith 236 passengers.I just missed him in the Philippinesright before a fire
at a petrochemical plantgassed a village of 2,000 people.You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation.That wreck triggered a civil war.These are no accidents.They're links in a chain.The work of a single organization,
the Syndicate.A rogue nation,
trained to do what we do,imbued with a new sense of purpose.Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way.An anti-IMF.Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement,the start of a new phase.Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.He was there.Every time.Just like he was there tonight,
I'm sure of it.I don't know who he is, where he's from,how he's funded.But I know he's the key.Ethan, this is what I signed up for.
Let me help you find him.That's why I brought you here
in the first place,and look what happened!I can't protect you.That's why I need you to leave.That's not your decision to make, Ethan!I am a field agent. I know the risks.More than that, I am your friend,no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week.Now, you called me
because you needed my help.And you still do. So I am staying.And that is all

the Syndicate exists,why don't they just tell the CIA?Because they don't want
anyone knowingthe Syndicate was created
by one of their own.I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trustand eventually identify the members
of his organization.And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are.Lane had a ledger.It contained the identities of
his operatives, his terrorist associates,the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate.One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping.He died being interrogated
for the access code,leaving Lane with a serious problem.So the key to crushing Laneis sitting in a computer,
just waiting for someone to take it.So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?Oh, he has.He sent me.And I can tell youit's impossible.The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard.And the only way to download the ledgeris through the central
computer terminal, located there.<i>To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gate,</i><i>access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition,</i><i>and open
three separate combination locks.</i>BENJI: <i>Well, that's easy.
We just impersonate the agent</i>who stole the ledger in the first place,
and I get to wear a mask!ILSA: Unfortunately, even if you could
make it throughevery other security measure,
you won't beat the last one.<i>That's because it's protected
by gait analysis.</i><i>The step beyond facial recognition.</i><i>These cameras actually know

into the vault,and I wind up in a Moroccan jail,playing mummies and daddies
with Ahmad the Strangler.Okay, I don't get to wear a mask.And there's no other way
into the computer lab?ILSA: No other way in.- Air shaft?
- Six-inch-diameter pipe.Foundation?Twelve feet of concrete, top and bottom.- Electrical conduit.

into that terminalunless your profile is preinstalled
in the security system.<font color="#D900D9">[GROANS]</font>Profile.Where are the profiles stored?All security data is stored offline
in the liquid-cooled array.Here, inside the torus.Liquid-cooled.
You mean that thing is underwater?- Yes.
- Yes.Okay. So, to get the ledger,<i>one of us needs to enter the torus</i><i>and change the security profile,</i><i>so that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.</i>- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.Can I get in through there?
What's that?That's the service hatch.
It can only be opened from the inside.If you try and open it from the outside,you'd be hit with 70,000 gallons
of pressurized water.Where does the water come from?Desalinized seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant.And, before you ask, the system
is designed to shut down automaticallyif any metal enters the intake.No oxygen tanks.All right.
Well, how long will it take to free swimfrom the intake to the service hatch?Two minutes,
with the current at full power.Then you just have to hold your breath
for two minutes.What about installing
the security profile?Well, that's gonna be, like,
a minute, tops.So I have to hold my breath
for three minutes.You can do that.What I think you're overlooking
is the physical exertion.The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.Don't worry about him, all right?
All he has to do is install the fake profilebefore I get to the gait analysis.
You said it yourself, it's the only way.<font color="#D900D9">[CHUCKLES]</font>

you made a copy of that disk.Of course I made a copy.So where are we going?<font color="#D900D9">[BELL TOLLING]</font>It's a ledger.
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.Who they are,
the politicians they control,and where the money comes from.
It's everything you want to know.What makes you think
this so-called ledger is authentic?Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa.It's what he's trained to do.Lane lies to you,
you sell these lies to Hunt.Together, you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective.This may be authentic.But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.No.My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicatethat we may learn more
about them firsthand.This isn't proof.
It's a test, like everything else.The only way to pass is to go back.I can't do that. I've betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.And in every instance,
you did so on your own volition.He was going to torture and kill
an American agent.And you should have let him.
Then you would still have Lane's trust.This is the trade. Hunt understands that.I wasn't going to let him die.
He's our ally.There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa,
only common interests.As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man
without a country.This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?Good God, no.
Nothing so crude as that. No.Lane will order you.And to regain his trust,you will do it.You sent me to do a job. I did it.Now you bring me in!Might I remind you,
you are without a country of your own?The Director of the CIA called me,
inquiring about you personally.Of course, to protect your cover,
I had to lie.So, as far as the Americans
are concerned,you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.Precious few people know
about your true identity.It would be unfortunate if we forgot.You see, there really is no choice, Ilsa.You're going back.Glad to know you're still with us.- ETHAN: What's happening?
- LUTHER: I can't open it.- What do you mean, you can't open it?
- I mean I can't open it, ever.That's a red box.- A what?
- It's a red box.The British government uses them
to transport state secrets.- Doesn't sound good.
- BENJI: Meaning it's triple-encrypted.You're not getting into that thingunless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan,and a voice phrase spoken
by a specific individual.The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.Yes, him.So what you're saying is
there is no ledger,which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists.So we're back to square one,
only now we are all wanted by the CIA.I'm so proud of us.BENJI: What I don't understand is
why is there a red boxsat in a private data vault in Morocco?And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?If Lane wants it,
you can bet he has a plan to open it.And we just helped him steal it.He's going to take the Prime Minister.Yes, he is. The question is how.Well, we have to warn
the British government.Yeah, MI6.No, Brandt. Put down the phone.
Let's think about this for a minute.We have a responsibility
to warn the British governmentand not gamble
with the Prime Minister's life, Ethan,just so you can beat the guy
that has beaten you at every turn.Is that what you think this is?Brandt?Is that what you think this is?I think right now you're incapable
of seeing that there is another way.And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.And if he is wrong,
then we have Vienna all over again!You don't know him.If he wants something to happen,
there is no preventing it!That's why we have to warn the British.Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.Are you listening to yourself?
We are going to warn the British.No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him,before he takes the Prime Minister.Okay.All right, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.But please tell me
how are we going to do that?<font color="#D900D9">[TABLET CHIMES]</font>All is forgiven.That isn't a ledger, is it?You didn't take a look for yourself?Of course I did,
but the file was encrypted.And why would I lie to you?So that I would lie to Hunt.But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.And you wouldn't have helped him.What is actually on that disk?I'll be honest with you
when you start being honest with me.Now, you and I both know
why you've come back. Don't we?Hmm?You're still alive
because I believe in your potential.But I'm growing impatient.Why do you continue to resist?Well, if we're being honest,
you're a terrorist.If that were true,
my goal would be to spread fear.But my method is far more surgical.You kill innocent people.I helped my government kill
many innocent people and more.So much more.Killing to keep things as they were.And now I'm killing
to bring about change.I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
And one day his luck will run out,and thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.Which one of us will be the villain then?Nothing here. It's empty.<font color="#D900D9">[EXHALING SHARPLY]</font>I'm interested to see who you blamefor what happens next.So that's her?That's her.I have to say you sure can ride.- Ethan...

I was going to take it to him.I hoped you would.
I hoped it'd be enough to get you out.Whoa, whoa, whoa. That means
Lane doesn't have the disk. Only we do.I have a question.If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?<i>Unless, of course,
Lane wanted us to find her.</i>So who you working for now?Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.We only think
we're fighting for the right sidebecause that's what
we choose to believe.So where does that leave us?The way I see it,
you have three choices.One, you hand me
and the disk over to the CIA.I am proof the Syndicate exists.Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done.- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.But you know
they're not gonna believe you.And you'll all be tried for treason.Lane goes free.I'm afraid she has a point.Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.But some part of you suspects
you've met your match.And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,whether you want to or not.That is entirely possible.And option three?Come away with me.Right now.Oh, boy.And what about Lane?Forget about Lane.There will always be another Lane.There will always be people like us
to face him.We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.We can be anyone.We can do anything.It's only a matter of going.Lane sent you to deliver a message,
didn't he?I've saved your life twice.

an imaginary terror network.But new intelligence suggests
he's been manipulatedby one of your own former agents.Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared two years ago.If you don't mind my asking, what do
I have to do with this phantom network?Uh, sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.He came forward with firsthand
knowledge of the plot against you.Sir, Hunt is in possession
of a virtual red boxthat can only be opened by you.He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.The Syndicate, you say?BRANDT: Yes, sir.
That's what he calls it.Atlee?He couldn't possibly be talking aboutthat Syndicate.Because you assured me that
that Syndicate was merely an exercise.And it was, Prime Minister,
I can assure you.And yet here we havethe Central Intelligence Agency
indicating otherwise.I don't understand.Prime Minister, your life is in danger.I think our first priority is to move you
to a secure location.Sir, does the name Solomon Lane
ring a bell?Yes.Unfortunately, it does.So there actually is a Syndicate?It was the hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.Recruit former agents
from other nations,supply them with a new identity,and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshorein a virtual red box
which I alone would control.It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner,with zero accountability.I rejected the proposal, unequivocally.Furthermore,
I was given every assuranceit never passed the planning stage.Prime Minister, there is no Syndicate.These men have been duped

CHAIRMAN: Director Hunley?Director Hunley!Uh, Mr. Chairman.MR. CHAIRMAN: Six months ago,
you stood before this paneland demanded that
the IMF be dissolved.DIRECTOR HUNLEY:
That is correct, sir.How do you explain
your testimony today?It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe thatthe Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level.In order for our man
to infiltrate that organization,his cover had to be absolute.The whole operation was knownonly to myself
and a handful of IMF agents.So the shuttering of the IMF
was all part of an elaborate schemeto expose the so-called Syndicate.That is correct, sir.Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.That is correct, sir.I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.Uh, desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.And you, Mr. Brandt,
how can you justify this deception?I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operationwithout the Secretary's approval.Welcome to the IMF,Mr. Secretary.

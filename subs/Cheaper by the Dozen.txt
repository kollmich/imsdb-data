Good morning, Tom.<i>Twelve is our number.</i><i>It's the number of games my husband Tom</i>
<i>coaches at Lincoln College every season.</i><i>It's the number of times we zero out our</i>
<i>bank account each year to make ends meet.</i><i>And it's the number of kids</i>
<i>we try to keep track of.</i>- <i>Hey. Good run?</i>Oh, yeah.You need a paramedic?No, just a pair of knees.
You finish?Still proofing, but I'm sending it
to Diane today.Look at this.
New, clean cover...no peanut butter stains...
yet.- Hey, baby?
- Baby?You know, on the run,
you know what I was thinking?What?Well, we've been married,
what, five years?- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-three. Sorry.And I think we could use
a little change around here...like-like this
lumpy old mattress.- Maybe we should just,
you know, get rid of it.Don't be ridiculous, honey. You know you
can just pound the lumps out of a mattress.What-What do you mean? You can just
pound the lumps out of a mattress?Yeah, just randomly
start swatting away.- And it goes flat?
- Yes, yes.Just start-- You just randomly
start swatting--Careful.-I got a dog on me!
- <i>Twelve's an insane number of kids...</i><i>but having a small family</i>
<i>was never an option for us.</i><i>See, Tom loved growing up</i>
<i>with seven brothers and sisters.</i><i>And after my sister died,</i>
<i>l spent most of my time...</i><i>wishing I had</i>
<i>seven brothers and sisters.</i><i>Tom and I met at</i>
<i>Illinois Polytechnic University.</i><i>He was a senior dreaming of becoming</i>
<i>the head football coach there.</i><i>l was a freshman dreaming</i>
<i>of becoming a sports reporter.</i><i>He wanted eight kids,</i>
<i>l wanted eight kids. Bam.</i><i>An hour after I met him,</i>
<i>l knew he was the one.</i><i>We just had family</i>
<i>at the wedding.</i><i>Oh, and Shake Maguire,</i>
<i>Tom's best man.</i><i>What a hot dog.</i><i>A year later,</i>
<i>we had our first</i>-- <i>Nora.</i><i>I loved taking her</i>
<i>to work with me.</i><i>After Charlie and Lorraine were born, we</i>
<i>realized our dream of living in the city...</i>- <i>and having eight kids and</i>
<i>two careers wasn't gonna work.</i><i>As much as we wanted our big careers,</i>
<i>we wanted our big family more.</i><i>So Tom settled for a Division lll</i>
<i>coaching job at Lincoln...</i><i>l quit writing for the</i> Tribune,
<i>and we moved to the country.</i><i>Tom and I got busy</i>
<i>when we moved to Midland.</i><i>We had Henry, Sarah,Jake and Mark</i>
<i>in consecutive years.</i><i>Then we went for magic number eight,</i>
<i>and instead...</i><i>we got the first set</i>
<i>of fraternal twins</i>--<i>Jessica and Kim.</i>- <i>Nine kids.</i>
- Come on, you guys. Come on.Wave! Hi!<i>With each child, Tom and I got further</i>
<i>from our big career dreams.</i><i>But we didn't think about that.</i>- Yeah!Oh. Sorry, Coach.<i>We had our hands full with nine.</i>
<i>We were happy, and we were done.</i><i>Then we went to a party celebrating</i>
<i>Shake Maguire's appointment...</i><i>to athletic director</i>
<i>at our alma mater.</i><i>And, well, too many beers and nine</i>
<i>months later, we had Mike.</i><i>After that,</i>
<i>Tom got a vasectomy.</i><i>But he didn't hear the doctor say</i>
<i>that it would be a few weeks...</i><i>before the procedure</i>
<i>became effective.</i><i>In '98, Nigel and Kyle got us</i>
<i>to that crazy number 12.</i><i>But by then, Tom and l</i>
<i>were experts at managing chaos.</i>- Let's move, gang.
Come on, come on, come on!- Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
- Charlie missed his curfew again
last night. Take care of that.Hey.You can only put on
so much lip gloss, princess!- You blew my concentration!
- <i>Temper, Sarah.</i>Now I get to start
all over again.- Wrap it up, Lorraine!
- <i>Okay, Daddy.!</i>- Have you seen my frog, Dad?Sorry, Charlie.
Uh, Nigel. Kyle.- It's Mark.
- I knew that.Hey, teenager. You got caught
on Mom radar last night.You're not gonna get that scholarship
if you're out late with Beth...the night before a big game.Well, I'm not so sure
l even want to go to college.Since when?Since Beth's mom offered me
a job at the auto shop.Hmm. Sounds exciting.Well, we'll talk about that
after you get your full ride.And, meanwhile, in by 1 0:00
on school nights. Clear?- Got it.
- Anything else you wanna talk about?Did I mention
l don't like you very much?- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Then I'm good.- Okay, me too.Dude, two words:
need new skates.Dude, three words:
paper route.''Hi. Can't make dinner. Hank and l
are moving into our new apartment.Love, Nora.''- Have you seen Beans, Mom?
- Mm-mm.- <i>Here you go, Gunner.</i>
- <i>You hungry, boy?</i>Here you go, Gunner.
Are you hungry?Look, I am totally aware that
this family doesn't value...self-presentation in the same
obsessive way thatIdo.<i>Fine. Whatever.</i>
<i>But one of my life goals...</i>aside from being, like,
a fashion guru...is to indicate to
the local community that...the Baker family
actually owns a bar of soap.<i>So, as self-appointed in-house</i>
<i>rep of style and hygiene...</i>I think I should be allotted at least five
extra minutes in front of the mirror.- Three.
- Done.Now help your sister
butter the toast.Sarah, your suspension from lacrosse
for excessive force has been lifted.<i>So you're going today. Henry,</i>
<i>you have band practice, all right?</i>l cleaned your clarinet. Please don't
play with food in your mouth again.Kim and Jessica, your teacher called
and has made a request...that you do not correct her
in front of the class.<i>Mike, you have show-and-tell today.</i>
<i>And, please, honey...</i>remember that body parts
do not count.Kyle and Nigel, you have
a dentist's appointment at 3:00.
You're goin' to work with Dad.Yeah!- And we're shooting
our Christmas card today.- What time's Nora coming over?
- Uh, she may not make it.She hardly ever comes home since
she started dating that doorknob.- He's not a doorknob.
- The man irons his jeans, Mom.- Yeah, that's weird.
- <i>Never mind.</i>l'll shoot it without her.
l'll Photoshop her in.Honey, could you take 1 0 pounds
off me with that Photoshop thing?- Can I be Photoshopped in?
- Wait. If Sarah's bein' Photoshopped in...- then I'm definitely
gonna get Photoshopped in.
- Why don't we all be--Nobody gets Photoshopped in but Nora.
Everybody be here by 4:00.Why do we always do
our Christmas cards in May anyway?Because the earlier we get it done,
the bigger discount we get at the printer.- <i>Now, let's eat.!</i>Here you go.
Look alive.No, Mark!Get him!- <i>Come on.! Get him, Charlie.!</i>
- <i>He's headed for the waffles.!</i>- <i>l got him, Charlie ! I got him !</i>
- <i>Come to Daddy.! Come on.!</i>Mike, stick!- Mark, net!
- I got the door covered!l got the net!- Whoa!
- Ooh!<i>Uh-oh. Busted.</i>Put Beans in his cage...now.ls everything broken?Teacup with
the flower on it broken?Nice move, FedEx.<i>Okay, here we go,</i>
<i>everyone. School. Let's go.</i>Hey.Much cooler.- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Henry, here you go.
- <i>Thanks, Mom.</i>For the record, I am so over Nora's
hand-me-downs.All right, well, you look gorgeous
in anything, Lorraine.Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's goin' on?
What's wrong with you, mister?Everybody says
the FedEx guy dropped me off...'cause I don't fit in
with this family.You fit.
You fit right here.- Like that.
- <i>l called shotgun.!</i>- No,Idid!
-Idid!-Idid!
- <i>All right, that's it.!</i>Hey, you two,
knock it off!.Mom's losing it!
I'm losing it!All right. All right. Come on.
Break it up. Break it up.<i>Here we go. Are you okay?</i>
<i>l'll give you candy.</i>- Nigel, Kyle, chill or be chilled.
- Sure. Listen to him.Mark? Oh.- So Nora's not coming?
- Well, not exactly. Here.That is so Nora. We tell 'em
they can't sleep together...when they visit,
so she moves in with him.Honey, she's just trying
to have her own life.- She's too young to have her own life.
- She's 22.The same age I was
when I was pregnant with her.Five minutes ago, she was
sitting on my shoulders...pointing at cows
in Munger's Field.- And then you blinked.
- Yeah.- Enough with the blinking.
No more blinking.
- All right.You were checking me out,
weren't you?Yes, I was.
You got a problem with that?Twelve kids later,
and we still got the heat.Whoo!<i>Come on.! Hit it.!</i><i>Faster, faster, faster.!</i>- ls that as fast as you can go?
- ls that all you got?Pump 'em high!
Pump 'em high! Let's go!- Pump it up!
- That's good! That's good!That's what I'm talkin' about.
Way to go, Marcus.- <i>Way to go, boys.!</i>
- <i>Nice passes.</i>- Right here.
- Nice job!Man, you're gettin'
old and ugly.Shake.Hey.Hey, what are you
doin' here?What, are you still too busy
bein' the pansy house-husband
to read the newspapers?That coach was 5-3.That's doesn't cut it.
I'm trying to grow a program.Hey, guys. Remember Shake?
We played college ball together.Yeah, the hot dog.Mom said it first.We're having
adult time here, boys.No idea what that means.<i>Well, it's this crazy thing</i>
<i>where grown-ups...</i>actually get to have a conversation
without being interrupted by kids.- Sounds wicked boring.
- <i>It is.</i>So why don't you run along?Mom's right.
He is a wiener.<i>Sorry about that. Kate likes you.</i>
<i>It's just that, you know...</i>she had to have the biggest
stud on the team.So she, uh, chose
the third-string receiver...and got all this.Yeah.So, are you gonna
tell me why you're here?Lincoln's a winning machine.You think you can make
our old team a champion again?- You mean coach?
- Coach.- Tom, what is it? Just tell me.-Just--
- Okay. Wait.- Dad's covering with the machines.- To the chute!
- Go, go, go!<i>My, this is big.</i>Shake Maguire wants me
to coach the Stallions.- Get out!
- He offered me...a fat five-year contract, housing
allowance, moving expenses.Kate, we can finally get new furniture.
We can get a new car.And get this. University employees
can send their kids to school for free.Wow.Oh. I don't know, honey.
A Division L coaching job...that's a lot of pressure
and a lot more hours.Yeah, but with all the kids in school next
year, we could handle more job pressure.Yeah, but, honey, Midland is our home.
l mean, the kids' lives are here.Midland has been great
for raising our kids...but I never expected 'em
to sacrifice the way thatIdid.You loved your childhood.Yeah.Except for this part--
the raggedy, hand-me-down part.The Stallions head coach.It's your dream job,
isn't it, honey?l want this one, Kate.Let's talk to the kids.How do you think
they'll handle it?- We're gonna move!Okay, everybody,
you know the drill.On ''three,''
you give me a big ''cheese.''Jake, do you have
to wear black?Black works, Mom.Jesus, like,
has his funeral on Christmas.- He died on Easter, Barbie.
- Whatever.He was resurrected
on Easter, moron.- Be quiet.
- <i>Don't touch me.!</i>- Hey, hey, hey!
What's all the fighting about?Exactly when did you plan
on telling us about moving?- I'm not moving!
- Yeah, because I'm not moving, all right?- I'm not moving.
- Charlie, Evanston is only four hours away.- Beth can come and visit.
- This isn't just about Beth, Mom.- My whole life is here at Midland.- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.- Hi, Nora. You're on speaker.
- Hi, everybody.Hank says hi too. So, you guys
are thinking about moving up here?Yeah. You got room in that new
apartment for your big old family?Just big enough for two, Dad.
How's your book going, Mom?Actually, I just sent it to a friend
who's in publishing, so we'll see.- Could we stay on subject, please?
- <i>Beans's mother's buried here.</i>I'm not splitting them up.
They're family.We can build a fancy new memorial
to Pork in our new yard.- Yeah, like we could afford that.
- Actually, we can.l'll be making enough money to do that,
get you out of hand-me-downs...<i>getJake those new skates, and get</i>
<i>that new car we've been saving for.</i>- But I have friends here!
- Honey, you'll keep in touch.
And you can make new friends.Quiet!Now, look,
l know you're all scared.Moving is a big deal. We're
very comfortable here. I get that.And that's why I turned down a lot of
other coaching offers through the years.But this is a job
l wanted since we left Chicago.And, in fact,
it's more than a job to me.Um, this is my team...<i>and it's my colors</i>
<i>and it's, um...</i>the Stallions.And they're finally
calling my number.<i>And I want you to take this risk</i>
<i>with me, because if you do...</i>l promise you, we will be...a happier and stronger family.- You promise?
-Ipromise.-I would feel happier and
stronger if we vote on it.
- Yeah, definitely.- <i>We should vote.</i><i>That's the only way to make it fair.</i>
<i>It's the only way to do it.</i>All right, we can vote.But in the end, your mother and I are gonna
do what we think is best for the family.- What's the point of even voting?
- I'm out.- Let's get out of here.
It's not even worth it.
- <i>Come on, guys.</i>Hello? Still here.All right, eight noes...three yes's
and three maybes.<i>Not exactly a mandate.</i>Give me a pen.
I'm gonna change some of these.Here we go.- What?
- ''What''?Let's review, shall we?Here we go.I'm so glad I found someone
whose dreams are as big as mine.l love you. Kate.''l always loved the way
you go for things, Tom.Pedal to the metal, full-on,
all of it or none of it.So we're doing this.We're gonna do this.We're doing it.Yeah. And by the time we move,
the kids'll get used to the idea.<i>Say good-bye</i>
<i>to your mother, Beans.</i><i>Gunner, to the car.!</i>- Come on!I'm you.
Gunner, to the car!- I'm Gunner. Gunner, to the car!<i>Hey, Charlie. Do me a favor</i>
<i>and drive the Cutlass?</i>Thanks for ruining my life.<i>l don't wanna move.!</i>- You know what?
Everybody's going with us.We're taking all your toys.
Okay.Well, whoever said expressing
emotion is a good thing, l'd like to see.Hey, this is our street.Are you sure we're gonna
fit in here, Dad?You'll have friends here
in no time, guys.<i>Here we are.</i>
<i>We are here. Everybody out.</i><i>l want everybody out.</i>- Hey, slow down there, Gunner!- Wait up!
- Hey, Kyle, check this place out!- Cool!There it is-- a 1920s classic.What, did the Munsters
give you a good price?<i>All right, the twins share, but</i>
<i>everybody else gets their own room.</i>- Now, go kill each other for the best one!
- That's great.Hey, Charlie.You're gonna need a car to visit Beth.
The Olds is yours now.You trying to bribe me?ls it working?Little bit.Come on.Welcome home, Kate.- It's gonna be great, Tom.
- Mmm.<i>Jessica, come here.!</i>
<i>Check this out.!</i>- <i>This room is huge.!</i>

Back it up, FedEx.If anyone gets the room
across from me, it's Charlie.- And are you Charlie? No.
- <i>Dude, I call this room.</i>- <i>Nobody else gets it, okay?</i>

<i>Who's next? Yes?</i><i>It's been reported that you like</i>
<i>to blast music in your locker room. Why?</i>Uh, well,
it loosens up the players...and, uh,
gets 'em psyched.Unless, of course, I start dancing.
Then they just get nauseous.At least we get

You're an only child.It might be fun
to babysit together.No! Whoa, no!No. You know what happened
last time we visited.- They were welcoming you into the family.
- They set me on fire!Just your pants.Honey, I am an actor, okay? And, sure,
last time it was just my pants.But what if next time
it's my face?This is the moneymaker.
I'm not that good of an actor.This is how I get the jobs.
l know that.I'm man enough to admit it.Please?- Don't look at me like that.
Don't look at me like that!
- Please, please, please, please?You always do that to me.
Fine, fine. You know what? We'll go.But l'll tell you what.
One thing happens, and I'm gone.And no fires.
And we sleep in the same room.Kimmy, put Dad on.She says she'll help us out if
they can stay in the same room.No. No way.No, she knows the rules. She wants
to have her own room when she's here.Isn't that sweet? No.Okay, look, why don't you just come over
on Sunday, and we'll talk logistics.- All right. Bye.
- Tell me Doorknob Man
isn't babysitting too.Yes, he very well
might be, young lady.And do not set
his pants on fire again.- <i>Yes.</i>
- Classic.<i>It was just his pants.</i>ls anybody besides me thinking
our happier and stronger life...was actually code
for ''nastier and suckier''?First, Dad forces us
to move.Then Mom decides to become a career
person and, like, travel the globe.Now we have to take orders
from Hank, the model/actor?- And he hates kids too.
- Ow!Nora's blind to his evil. We have
no choice but to intervene.We've got 48 hours.
Let's work a plan.<i>All right, Appleschmear season</i>
<i>is officially open.!</i>The president of the United States,
Sarah Baker...will throw out the first apple.Come on. Bring on the chin music, baby.
Let's go. Let's go.<i>Let's go. Oh, yes !</i>Ho, it's an apple!
And now it's sauce.And that's a beauty!
Mmm! Mmm!- Whoa!Appleschmear. It's the game my
Great-Grandma Gilbreth invented.- Neat.Time out.
Nora's here.- Nora! Nora!

We'll have 'em dry in no time.''Sorry about your clothes, Hank.
We'll have 'em dry in no time.''What is with the staring?
Just stop looking at me.Chopsticks.Open meat bucket.Oh!Begin underwear soaking.So, um, how's the acting
career going, Hank?If it was goin' any better,
there'd have to be two of me.Yeah, we saw you in the commercial
with the gargling-- the mouthwash ad.You know, the remarkable thing
about my career is...l only started acting, uh,
a month ago...and, uh,
I'm already on TV.<i>It's the real deal. The career</i>
<i>is white hot, Tom. It's on fire.</i>l read that most actors end up
in the food service industry.That's not gonna happen
to Hank, Kim.<i>Candidly,</i>
<i>l, uh, think Nora's right.</i>It's really-- It's gettin' so as I can
hardly go out in public anymore.<i>l mean, really, with</i>--<i>between the</i>
<i>autograph hounds and the paparazzis</i>--Autographs and everything?
I mean, just the one commercial...and you have paparazzi?Yeah. I've-I've actually--
I've never actually seen them...but, you know, they hide
in the bush and they get their shot.<i>The crazy thing is that now we're trying</i>
<i>to sit at home like regular joes</i>--Yeah, well, honey, it's--
And we're watching TV, right?<i>And, boom, comes on a commercial,</i>
<i>and, bam, there's me.</i>It's, like, you expect to see yourself
in the mirror...you know, and you expect
to be lookin' at the handsome devil...but not on--
not on the TV like it is.<i>It's, like, bam.! Bam.! You turn</i>
<i>the channel. You're tryin' to...</i><i>you know, get it out,</i>
<i>and it's</i>--<i>it just keeps poppin' up.</i>It's like I can run from me,
but I can't hide from me.What a nightmare!Yeah.Nora, honey, you wanna
help me in the kitchen?Nora, stop!
Yeah. Mm-hmm.Wanna help me in the kitchen? Get a pie,
look at a picture of Grandma, say the rosary?- <i>Come on, kids. Here we go.</i>
<i>Everybody out.</i>
- l'll be back.Tommy.
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.- Gunner!- Save it, boy.- Hey!
- Hey.There you go.
You look as good as new.- Yeah. Not as good as you, chief.
- Yeah, anywhere.- How sweet.
- You know what you want?Kate, is this-- is this
orange juice freshly squeezed?Nora and I are on
a bit of an organic diet...and we're only goin' with
the organic freshly squeezed...and it tastes a bit
like Tropicana.<i>He's a winner.</i>- Gunner, no!Release the hound.All right, charge!You guys poppin' out
another one any time soon?Just... curiosity.- Gunner!- Gunner!
- Gunner!It's Gunner.Honey, he's--
he's really digging in.Sorry, babe.
Gunner, stop! Sit-Sit down!- <i>He's attacking.!</i>
- Stop it, Gunner.- Oh, my. Well, he's hungry.
- <i>Stop it, Gunner.!</i>- Gunner!Get him off!.
Get him off!.Nora! Nora, we didn't
want <i>you</i> to go.Look, let's just get
something clear.Even though you guys live

Sarah Baker.But it's going to cost

and go to your rooms!Soaking his underwear in meat?l mean,
how do they come up with that?If I could just harness that ingenuity and

to help you out while I'm gone.l can handle it, even without
the better half of the tag team.l know, honey. I'm just worried.
l've never left the kids--- Honey, it's three days!
- <i>l know.</i>I'm just--
I'm gonna miss 'em.<i>Okay, I froze some dinners. And</i>

Likes it hot and nice and spicy!Yeah. Here we go.
There we go. Got it. All right.- Hey, Dad.

Where's the Band-Aid?- <i>Dad, it still hurts.</i>

- How are you?- Good, I guess.
- <i>Sorry, Dad.!</i>l mean, it's kind of weird
having all this free time.- You sure everything's all right, honey?
- Oh, honey, everything's fine.- I can handle it.All right, you know, I'm just used to
tag-teaming to manage the mob.- So I thought--
- Oh, no. They're like kittens.- Whoa!
- <i>Sorry, Dad.!</i>Uh, well, this might be a good time then
to talk about me staying a few extra days.- What? A few extra days?
- Uh, 1 4, give or take.What did I say about throwing darts?That's a lot of days, Kate,
and a couple of key games.All right, but I have a plan.
If we just take it one day at a time...and if you start to get overwhelmed
or the kids stage a coup...you call me up, I'm home,
end of trip.Well, uh, s-s-sounds good.
Sounds good.- Got him in the face!Okay, honey, thanks for doin' this.
Give me someone.Oh. Hey, uh, you know what?
They're doing homework right now...and it's that math, uh, trig--
''trigadronomy'' thing that you
and I just aren't very good at.And it's the sweetest thing.
They formed a little study group...and they're helping each other,
and, uh, it's like a little mini, uh...- think tank thing.And l'd just hate
to break that up.Well, give everyone my love, and
you call me right after dinner, okay?- Okay. Will do.
- Bye.- Bye.
- <i>Come on, Dad.</i>
<i>Don't hide in the closet.</i><i>Take it like a man.!</i>Two weeks'll go by in
no time, guys. You'll see.<i>Yeah, right.!</i>Yeah, right.- Yeah?- Hey.
- What's up?- Okay?
- Come in.<i>Look, your mom's not coming home</i>
<i>for a couple of weeks.</i>What?Okay. Up till now,
l've been, like, mellow...about this whole having-it-all lifestyle
that you and Mom are currently into...''A,'' because Sarah has the drama
queen role totally covered...and ''B,'' because l've benefited
from your salary spike...in various shallow
but nonetheless pleasing ways.But, Dad, check it out. This afternoon,
Mike was repelling from the roof...<i>Nigel was using Kim</i>
<i>as a human dartboard...</i><i>and you employed your son</i>
<i>as a vomit mop.</i>Call me crazy, Pops, but things are getting
pretty twisted around here.l need to hire some help.As in a babysitter? Okay,
that is so not happening.Dad, just call Mom and tell her
we need her back home.l just can't do that right now,
not with all the work she's done.It just wouldn't be fair.Well, then why don't you
spend more time at home?Honey, that's just not
an option right now.<i>l've got a big job,</i>
<i>a job that I love.</i>I'm gonna have to
call in some backup.<i>Hello.</i>Uh, my name is Tom Baker, and I'm
interested in hiring a domestic helper.Um, I have 12 children.Actually, I'm serious.-Just 1 2.
- Twelve.There's only two.
Oh, plus 1 0.How many kids? Well, uh, when
you get here we can just count 'em up.Well, there's 1 2.
But one doesn't live with me...and one you never see
'cause he's so mad.Uh, a dozen?Just-Just-Just 1 2.Hello. l'll just hang up on myself.- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Mike. What's up?- It's Mark.
- Right. Mark. What's up?l don't get this math homework.Hey, you know what? l've got a game
I'm not nearly prepared for.Could you go ask one
of your sisters to help you?Yeah. Okay.Hello. Yeah,
could you do me a favor...and send up 1 2 pillows
to 504?Yes.Thank you.Mmm.
That'll be good.''Hey, kids,
l had to get to work.''Lorraine and Kim,
you're in charge of breakfast.Henry and Jake, lunches.
Charlie, handle drop-offs.''- <i>Come on, Charlie. We're gonna be late.</i>Cute car seats, Baker.You know, we had to take
our little brothers to nursery school...if that's okay with you.What happened? Did-Did Mommy
and Daddy go back to the farm?You know what? This whole ''harass
the hick'' thing's getting pretty old.Actually, I'm just
gettin' started.- Yeah? What else you got?
- Yeah.- You don't wanna know, man.
- Oh, I wanna know.Charlie!
Charlie, Charlie, stop.Stop.Just let it go,
okay? Please.Yeah, Charlie.
Let it go, and go...- all the way back to Podunk.- Charlie, go.
- <i>Go.</i>Hey, Gil, I got
a real shot with this team.They're 2-0. They're rising in
the national standings...and they're taking
nothing for granted.- <i>Hey, Coach.</i>
- Hey, teenager, what's up?- We need to talk.
- Sure.- Look, Dad, um--
- Hey, guys, knock it off!.<i>All right, Coach.!</i>l know you're all lit up
about this new job...- but my new school--
- The press is waiting, Bake!- They're out there now?
- Yeah. Come on. Get dressed.
- Hey, can we do this later?Hey, kids.
How was your day at school?l'd say the high point was that you're
only 45 minutes late picking us up.Hey, you know what? There was
a pep rally at school today.There were 20,000 people in the stands,
and I just couldn't leave.- Here.
- Hey, you did a drawing.''My favorite place
in the world--''ls that the Midland house?President Gerhard and I have been
waiting for a half an hour.I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
l had to--l know you have responsibilities
at home, Bake, but this is it.This is your shot,
your moment, not theirs.<i>What's the matter with you?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>You've wanted this
for as long as l've known you.l just don't want to
see you blow it.l'll work something out.It's hard to believe someone as
staggeringly beautiful as you...<i>could deliver 1 2 children and</i>
<i>still look as yummy as you do.</i>Oh, that's so sweet.l guess the camera
can't see my hips.<i>Tell us,</i>
<i>did you have them conventionally?</i>Well, uh, after the sixth one,
they just kind of walked out.- Why don't you read us a little
something from your book?Oh, I don't know. No. People
can just buy it and then read it.- Oh, come on.
- The audience wants it.- Oh, all right. Okay.''Some, uh, call me a mom.''Others call me
a primary caregiver.But they both mean
the same thing: chauffeur.''You know, it sounds like you
and your husband have things
under control at home.Oh, well, I'm lucky
to have him. We sure do.Kids, on the carpet! Now!Dad!College guys?- What's goin' on here?
- Where's Charlie?-He went to Midland for the day.
-Midland? It's a school day.- He hates school.
- 'Course you couldn't know that
'cause you're never home.Well, that is about
to change, Sarah Baker.Because since I can't go to work
without you guys getting in trouble...and since I can't stay home
without Shake bugging me...l have brought my work
home with me.Guys, meet the family.
Family, meet the team.- 'Sup, boys?
- What's up?Okay, we will be in the living room.
We got a lot of work to do.l don't want any interruptions
unless it's an emergency. Clear?Okay. Now go do your homework.
Let's go, guys.<i>All right, first team, line up.!</i>Good. Good. Good.But you hit 'em too high.
You wanna hit 'em low.Twenty-four.Dad, come on!Hey, how's New York?Hi.Okay, l've gotta go now.l love you.Step off, missy!You don't talk that way
unless it's with humor!Something tells me you had an unpleasant
interaction with those boys, Mark.<i>They knocked my glasses off.</i>l heard you were
dissing my family.l don't even know
your family, loser.- You do now.
- My latte!Coach, give us a quote.Violence begets violence.<i>All right, enough is enough.</i><i>You're slacking on your chores.</i>
<i>You're fighting at school.</i>
<i>Things are out of control.</i>As of this moment,
you are all grounded.- What's ''grounded''?
- ''What's grounded?''l'll tell you what grounded is.
Except for attending games...you go to school;
you come home from school;you do your homework;
you do your chores;you go to bed;
and that's it.- But that--
- Oh, yes, Sarah, I know. That sucks.- But that's the way it is.
- Does this mean we can't go
to Dylan's birthday party?-That's exactly what it means.
-We bought his presents already.You are going to miss it!Now, go to bed!Hey, Gunner. Wanna get
up on the bed, buddy? Huh?- Come on.Come on.- Hello.
- Next year, let's book the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir too.Whatever happened to
pin the tail on the donkey?And on the end around, the guard pulls.
That means you, Buttler.I'm going to Dylan's
birthday party. Who's with me?Yeah!Hi-- Oh.Brazilian mud viper.
She gets one live rat a week.<i>Hey, Dylan. Wanna play catch</i>
<i>with the football I got you?</i>Uh, my nanny'd have to
check with my dad...who'd have to check with my mom
who would say it was an
inappropriate use of free time.Hmm. Sounds like a ''yes'' to me.
Go get it, Mike.And, O'Neal, you gotta crack
the first guy that shows outside.<i>Run, Billy.! Run.!</i>Kids?Get my kids.
l'll meet you at the house.- Ready!
- Break!Sarah Baker, off, now!- No way!
- Don't make me come up there!Oh, my God!
It's gonna blow!- Aaaah!It was my best birthday
ever, Coach.Your children are never
playing with Dylan again!- Sorry about your arm, Dylan.- Hello, Shake.Any idea what this could do
to my program? Don't speak. Listen.I don't want the players
at your house, and I don't want
your kids in the department.- <i>There he is.!</i>
- Coach! Coach! How will this
impact Saturday's game?Coach, what do you have to say
to reports that you're simply
spreading yourself too thin?- ls this child care or football?
- Sarah from Evanston,
you're on with Kate Baker.<i>Mom, it's Sarah.</i>Hi, Sarah.
ls everything okay?- Come home immediately.
-I wanna talk to her!- No! Guys!- <i>l wanna talk to her.!</i>
- Guys, stop!- Hello?Now look what you did.- Dad?
- Oh, Nora.Thanks for coming. Thank you,
thank you. I appreciate it.- You seemed kind of desperate on the phone.
- Yeah. They're... everywhere.You guys?- Hi.
- I just talked to the kids.Yes , I know everything.
Dylan's in the hospital.<i>Charlie's about to be expelled.</i>
<i>And Nora taking time off from</i>
<i>her first job to babysit?</i>- Can we do this later, Kate?
- No, Tom.You promised me that you would
let me know if you couldn't handle it.I'm doing the best I can.
Please, let's talk later.Bye.- What's the matter?
- The book tour's over
for me. I'm going home.<i>Get a move on, guys.</i>
<i>We gotta get dinner on the table.</i>Hi. It's me.
Okay, I'm coming home.Now, I know this
is gonna be a big strain.<i>The publishing company arranged</i>
<i>for the</i> Oprah Winfrey Show
<i>to tape at our house tomorrow...</i><i>which is, you know, great, but</i>
<i>I'm really gonna need your help.</i><i>We're talking Bakers full force. Boys,</i>
<i>you clean up the outside,;girls, the inside.</i><i>l want everybody</i>
<i>in fancy, nice, clean clothes.</i><i>And, Tom, if you could please supervise this</i>
<i>one last thing, I would really appreciate it.</i>- <i>Okay? All right. Bye.</i>Sounds like somebody
got his jimmy whipped.Jimmy whipped!Mommy!Beans, you okay?- Go get dressed, guys.- Hello.Oh, it's me. Yeah. My flight
was delayed. They lost my luggage.I'm gettin' there
as soon as I can. Sorry.Okay. Those are
for Oprah's people!- ls the house clean?
- We're working on it, Kate.- Okay. l'll see you when I see you.Okay, guys, good job!
Go inside and get cleaned up.Come on! Hustle up!
Hustle up! Let's go!<i>Camera truck's here.!</i>l need warm water!
Look out, Dad!Don't make a mess
in the kitchen!- Hello? Uh, Baker house?- Yeah. You guys from <i>Oprah?</i>
- Yes, sir.- She's really gonna be here?
- Any time now.Okay, well, just, you know,
set up anywhere.- Will do.
- Let's go, guys.<i>All right.</i>
<i>Let's set up over here, guys.</i>- <i>Knock much?</i>
- You got kicked off the team.Well, look who decided
to be a parent!Let's check
that attitude, Charlie.l don't fit in this town, Dad.
I'm going back to Midland.You are not dropping out of school,
and you are not walking out on this family.What family?Since we moved here, everybody's
been looking out for number one,
especially you and Mom.Your mother and I are doing
what we think is best for everyone.Whoa, whoa, whoa. You did not
take this coaching job for us.You took this because you were a loser
in college while Shake was being a superstar.If you want your shot at glory, if you wanna
have it all, you do what you gotta do.But quit feeding us this line about being
a happier and stronger family.This move was about you!
And you know what?l don't have to sit here and pay the price
for your life choices. I'm leaving.You're staying.Are you gonna make me?Charlie, I love you.l want you to have
the best life you can have.And that means you're
getting a diploma.When I graduate, I'm gone.<i>Hey, Charlie, am I looking</i>
<i>okay for national TV?</i>You know, you turned into
a jerk when we moved here!- Everybody turned into a jerk
when we moved here.Charlie?<i>Mom's home.!</i>- Mommy!
- Mommy!- Mommy! Never go away again!
- Hi.- Mom, listen up. Here's the sizzle.
-I missed you, honey.Okay, Dad is stressed to the point
of a total meltdown.Charlie's like a half a step away
from juvie, and Mark's--Okay. Oprah's coming.
We'll talk about it later. Here we go.- Whatever.
- I just wanna get everything ready.- What's the deal with Charlie?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?- I'm sorry. Hi.
- Hi. Charlie got kicked off the football team.- What?
- Don't worry. I'm handling it.Shake. President Gerhard.- Tom.
- Tom, we need a minute.- Please don't die, Beans.The university is prepared to make
an investment in the program...but we want some assurances.- What does that mean?
- We wanna know you're committed
to the football program.<i>You have to decide who's making</i>
<i>the bacon and who's cooking it.</i><i>So what's it gonna be, Tom?</i><i>Tom, didn't you pick up</i>
<i>my dry cleaning?</i>Yes, dear.
It's in the front closet.Well, I guess the wife
just answered our question.The wife's name
is Kate, Shake.What a wiener.<i>We want an answer by Monday,</i>
<i>Tom. This meeting's over.</i>I'm all right.l love you.I'm gonna go get ready.- Sorry, Dad.What's this?Hank slept over.
Do you have a problem with that?Yes, I have a problem with that!
This house is G-rated.Whoa, chief.
Look, Nora's a big girl.Now would be
an excellent time...for you to be
very, very quiet...chief.Now, get dressed
and get downstairs.Whoa.I just--I can't believe you let
things get this bad around here.- <i>l can't believe it.</i>
- What can I say?You didn't pick the perfect
moment to have a career.Oh, okay, yeah. I'm not even
gonna touch that hypocrisy.You told me to go to New York.
Mr.ICan Handle It.''Everything'll be okay.
Go, Kate!'' Help me, would you?So you're telling me you didn't
want to go to New York?No. I want a lot of things.
So do you.- That's the problem.
- This isn't working.- Yeah. That's my point.
- I meant the zipper.Let's just get through
the next hour, okay?- Fine.
- Fine.<i>Okay, everybody.</i>
<i>l know it's been a difficult day...</i>but I need all of you, and I would appreciate
it if you could just put on happy faces.Everything's great.
We're a big, happy family.If you can remember the lines
I told you to say to Oprah.If you can't remember, don't say
anything. Big smiles. Let me see 'em.<i>Mom, Beans is dead.</i>Nobody cares
about your stupid frog, FedEx.Stop calling me that!- <i>Don't you dare call him that.!</i>- <i>All right.! Hey.!</i>
- Stop it! Stop it!What's the name
of this segment again?Uh, ''One Big Happy Family.''Okay, I'm calling
Oprah's people right now.All I'm saying is,
families are inevitable.It's like death or taxes.Does that mean
you don't want children?- <i>Leave him alone.!</i>
- Hello!Look at these--
They're monsters!- Honey, you can't want this.
That's why you're with me.<i>Nora.! Come on.!</i>
<i>We need you down here.!</i><i>You're stepping on me.! Stop.!</i><i>Nigel, get off</i>
<i>your brother's head.!</i>Get off me!
Nobody cares about me!- Nobody cares about me!
- Mark, what's going on?- <i>Mark.! Mark.!</i>
- What are you talking about?- I'm perfect! l've never done
anything like this before!
- No! None of that!- Hey! Hey!
- No, you do not want to come down here.No, it's the farthest thing
from a happy family.Why am I the only normal
person in the family?Feel free to sleep
on the couch.You read my mind.Daddy, are you and Mommy
gonna get a divorce?Come here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.Mark's gone.- Mark's gone.
- What?Hey, Dad.What I said before--
l was out of line.Forget it.You were right.- Mark!- Hello.Hey, Mark ran away.
ls he with you?No. We'll come
help you look.There's me! Oh.- Mark's missing.
- Oh.<i>Take it to the max. Tommy Max.</i>Let's go.l look great.Did you not hear me?
My brother is missing!No. Did you not hear me?
I'm on TV!What was that for?Oh. What do you want?My son Mark ran away.
He's not here, is he?l always knew one of your kids
would land on a milk carton.Twelve is just
too big a number.- We'll help you look for him.
- It's-It's past Dylan's bedtime.We're gonna
look for him, Tina.- Thank you.
- Sure.Let the police handle it!
You'll never find him!Oh, we'll find him. Like you said,
1 2's a big number.- Mark! Mark!
- <i>Mark.!</i>He's about, about--
about that high.He's got red hair and glasses.
There's a photo, and you can keep that.No luck.
l've been everywhere.Thanks for looking.- Where's Hank?
- He's not gonna make the cut.l hope the family
isn't to blame.They're totally to blame.l'll have officers check
the train and bus stations.- He wouldn't get on a train or a bus.
- He might've.Those times whenIran away from Midland,
l was gonna go to Chicago.My favorite place in the world.Your favorite place in the world.You said we'd be happier.
You didn't keep your promise.l know. I'm sorry.<i>Mom.!</i>Oh, honey! Oh!Oh, we missed you, sweetheart.Do that again, I'm going
to have to pound you.- But I thought I was FedEx.
- Your eccentricities and vision problems...<i>are genetic traits that could be attributed</i>
<i>to any number of the Baker ancestors.</i>Yeah. Without you, we wouldn't
be the 1 2 Bakers anymore.We'd be, like, 1 1 .<i>l figured everybody hated me like Sarah</i>
<i>and Lorraine hate each other.</i>There are times when
l want to kill Sarah...but l'd kill for her
all the time.- Come here, cutie.Tom? You wanna say
something? A few words?Sure.Beans was a good frog.He was, uh, not like
a lot of the bad frogs...you hear about today,
all hopped up.- He was lovable. He was almost human.He was like, uh,
one of the family.<i>Except that, of course,</i>
<i>he was green and he ate flies.</i>But he was a hopper.He hipped and he hopped.He loved hip-hop.Mark, why don't you--I think
you should say something.For a long time, you were
the only person I could talk to.That's different now.But you're the one
who got me through.<i>Thanks.</i>I'm resigning after
the season, Shake.Giving up the dream, huh?Just going
with a different one.No regrets?If I screw up
raising my kids...nothing I achieve
will matter much.Thank you.We'll make an announcement
at the end of the week.Come on. Keep the assembly line
up here. We gotta get this done.- Where's Dad?
- He went to the game.Why didn't he
ask us to go?Because... he didn't want you to be there
on the day that he quits his job.- He's quitting his job?
- Mm-hmm.- What would we have to do
so he wouldn't quit?
- l'll give up clarinet lessons.- l'll go back to hand-me-downs.Okay, ease up.
Everybody listen.<i>Dad's a big boy, and</i>
<i>he makes his own decisions...</i>and he's doing this
because it's what he wants.In that case, I totally take back
what I said about the hand-me-downs.l thought so. Anybody else
wanna take back their offer?<i>Yeah, there we go.</i><i>l guess you could say</i>
<i>that when Tom and I left Midland...</i><i>we had a mess of theories</i>
<i>about how to raise children.</i><i>We still have a mess</i>
<i>of children, but no theories.</i><i>Sure, 1 2 is still our number.</i><i>It's the number of months</i>

- Not necessarily.- That's right.
- You didn't tell Lou until after
he chipped in for gas money.Hey, fellas, I'm telling you.
It's as simple as this.If you can't sell cars,
you can't pay people.Now, come on, come on, relax.I like splitting gas money four ways.
[ Laughs ][ Horn Honks ][ Machinery Clattering ][ No Audible Dialogue ]- Hey.

- Yeah, it's thrilling for us too.- Yeah. Real thrilling.
- What's the matter, boys? You look depressed.You worried about the Lions?
They're slow starters. Don't worry. It's pre-season.Hey, we ain't worried about the Lions!
What we're worried about is the <i>lines.</i>- Amen.
- Lines?Yeah. Unemployment lines, welfare lines,
food lines. You know, those lines?Lines, lines.
Yeah.Me and my wife went to the movies
the other night. We saw <i>Rocky.</i>And I'm watching this movie
and I'm thinking...there's something about this
movie that reminds me of work.Which <i>Rocky</i> was it?One or two? Or three?Uh, one, I think.
I don't know.Who was he fightin'?- Hey, did he have a mohawk?
- <i>Like Mr. T?</i>I don't know.
I don't remember. The point is,here's a guy who's taking
a pretty bad beating, you know?He's up against the ropes,
his eye's cut--- Was his manager dead or alive?
- <i>Yeah.</i>All right, forget <i>Rocky.</i>
<i>Forget I brought it up. Get it outta your head.</i>The point is, when you're down,
you're not necessarily out.You know-- I mean--You gotta hang tough.
I don't-- I don't know.[ Woman on P.A. ]

Let's eat dinner.- We're having special dinner.
- What are we having?- Colonel Chicken.
- We can't afford that![ Alex ]
Yea! Let's enjoy it. It may be our last.[ Sighs ]You know, I know this sounds crazy,
but I actually feel great.<i>I don't know why.</i>
<i>I don't know why, but I feel great.</i><i>I do, you know. Because,</i>
<i>I don't know, now I'll have the time...</i>to do some work around the house
I've been wanting to get to.- And, you know, we're in pretty good shape.
- Yep, we are, for a while.Wait, what do you think?
I'll never get another job again?
Don't worry about it.- I already put the word out.
- What would you say if I did too?Did too do what?[ Sighs ]
I put the word out.I have a couple of years' experience
in advertising. I have a college degree.- There's no reason I shouldn't
try to get a job myself.
- Have I been missing something?I mean, has your phone
been ringing off the hook?- Well, no, Jack.
- You think you're gonna get a job before I do?- Oh, this isn't a contest.
- No, hon. This'll be good. This is a good idea.We'll make it a contest.

- It'll be fun.I'll bet you a hundred to one...
- [ Groans ]
- you don't get a job before I do.- Jack--
- Okay, come on, doll face.
Give me a dollar.- I don't even have a dollar.
- Oh, you wanna bet,
but you don't have a dollar?- Hey, I don't wanna bet.
- Hey, I thought somebody said
they wanted to bet.- Wait till I get the kids.
- I don't bet. I don't take bets.

I'm makin' mommy a bet.Daddy's betting mommy
a hundred dollars to just her one dollar...- Wow.
- that she doesn't get a job before me.- Kenny, hold the money.
- I better hold it, dad.
Money makes him crazy.- <i>Good point.</i>
- <i>It isn't healthy.</i>Well, it may not be healthy,
but it's fun. Right, guys?- Oh, Jack.
- Can we bet too?
- Absolutely![Both Kids]
Yea![ Jack ]
Take the money, Caroline.Jack, I don't want the money.Look, you won.
A bet's a bet!Jack, I don't take bets,
and I don't want your money.- Aren't you being a little hard on yourself?
- No! It's fine!I mean, you have applied to everything
on wheels from Toyota to Schwinn.You're gonna get a job
any day now. Really.Uh-oh, I'm going to be late.
My first day.I want to make a very good
impression. How do I look?You look great.
You're gonna make a great impression.Now, do you wanna go over
that list one more time?No, I don't wanna go over the list!
Okay. Let's go over the list.Remember, when Kenny starts talking to
his breakfast, that means he's finished, right?- Alex has school at 7:30.
- 7:30.
- His pickup is 1:00 sharp.
- 1:00.- When Megan starts rubbing her
ears, it's time for her nap.
- Nap.But don't let her sleep past 11:30, because
she won't go down for her afternoon nap.- Wait. Will she rub her ears again?
- No. Just in the morning.- And please don't let her
sit around in a wet diaper.
- Obviously, hon.Kenny, he'll pretty much take
care of himself, won't you?<i>Just keep him busy.</i>
<i>Give him his tinkertoys or his coloring book.</i>I think Alex will be
a little helper, won't you?Sweetie. All right, just relax.
There's nothing to this, you know.- We got it covered. Right, guys?
- Okay.Oh, boy, am I gonna
miss you guys.- Take it easy on daddy.
Remember, he's a rookie.
- Bye, mom.- Bye, honey.
- <i>Mommy?</i>
- Yes?It's a jungle out there.[ Scoffs ]
Very funny, Jack.- I don't know where he gets this.
- On second thought, I will take this money.- I might need it for lunch
or something special.
- Okay.Actually, a lot of men would love to have
this kind of time to spend with their kids.Hon, you're looking at one.- I'm a regular Phil Donahue here.
- Yes, you are.- Okay, okay. Come here.
- Okay.Go get 'em.Oh, thanks for the loan.[ Thunder Crashing ]<i>Dad, you passed it!</i>- Passed what? We're right on time.

What is this? This is nuts.[ Car Horn Honking ]
[ Honks ][ Horns Honking Continuously ][ Jack ]
Why are they all honking?[ Alex ]
Because you're doing it wrong.Tell me I'm doing it wrong.
I know how to do this.Hi, Jack. I'm Annette.- Hi.
- You're doing it wrong.See?This is what I tell all my new mommies:
We enter from the south...and we exit from the north.And we do just the reverse
when we pick up.This way our little ones don't have to walk
between the cars to get to the learning facility.Okay, move it out,
and remember, south to drop off,<i>north to pick up.</i>
- <i>Pick 'em up. Okay! That's a good system.</i>[ Horns Honking ]South to drop off, moron![ Honking Continues ]Actually, I'm very excited to be going
back to work, especially here with Ron.Ron? And who would Ron be?Oh, Ron Richardson.Everyone here at the
Richardson-Frankel agency...calls him Mr. Richardson.Well, he asked me to call him Ron.And when was that?
In what context?In the context of my
interview at lunch.- Lunch?

let me give you some advice.Keep your mouth shut
and your ears open,and you just might
learn something.[ Everyone Shouting At Once ]You want to knock it off?Ron, what is your position?Thank you.My father founded this agency

Right.Look, you want me to be
really honest with you Ron?No. Lie to him.
He likes it.[ Everyone Laughing ]Well, frankly, none of this stuff
would influence me. All right?- Ooh.
- That's good.

and there's a secretary
that hates me for no reason.- Want me to go and kick
a little ass, honey?
- [ Together ] Yeah, dad!- All right.
- The only one that was even
civil to me was Ron.- Ron?
- You know, Mr. Richardson?
He actually asked for my opinion,and when I told him honestly
how I felt about something,
Ron liked what I had to say.<i>He did. Ron and his group</i>
<i>are flying to the plant tomorrow,</i>and they're gonna tour it,
and I was invited to go.Is than an unbelievable
first day or what?I can't believe it.

Ten minutes.- Ten minutes?
- [ Exhales ] Fifteen, tops.All right. Okay.
Fair enough.But if we stay longer than that,
we pull the old Aunt Emily.Okay. The Aunt Emily. Right.Wow. What a house.Yeah. Probably mortgaged

proud of our little Caroline, huh?Oh, yeah. We're, uh, very proud of her.

I'd say yeah, but I'll tell you,we've got to get over to see,
uh, Caroline's Aunt Emily.- She's...
[ Caroline ] Sick.
- ...Dying.Dead.Well, why don't you stick around
for a few minutes anyway,and you can, uh, watch
with the rest of the wives.Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean families.Boys, run down to the car and get dad's

So I'm not the father of the child.Well, that's some consolation.Just who is the culprit?<i>[ Woman ] You don't wanna know.</i>
- <i>Let me guess.</i><i>Probably the deceased Mr. Cashman.</i>
- <i>Ha. Wrong, Vic.</i>Wrong. Nikki
doesn't even love you.Vic, open your eyes. Buddy.
She's been makin' it with your friend Kevin.- You mean Kevin Bancroft?
- That's exactly who I mean.Watch. She's gonna
blame it on you now.You threw me at him. You let him know it
was perfectly fine to take me to San Francisco.Only he took me to bed first,
and it's your fault.[ Scoffs ]
Did I tell ya? I knew it.Wake up, Vic!
She already buried one husband.[ Kevin ] Do you think I'm gonna let that
get in the record for everybody to see?Or for the child to find out later on?[ Nikki ]
Then we'll just have a no-fault divorce.We don't get along.

- Because I wasn't unhappy!Maybe I was a little confused.
Maybe I was a little frustrated.But I knew what I was
doing was important,because it means something
to raise decent human beings.What saw me through was pride.
I had pride in this house, in my kids...and in being Mrs. Jack Butler!Where are you going?I'm going downstairs and sleep on the

1
00:01:57,735 --> 00:01:59,612
I love you, Billy.

2
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:05,868
I love you too, Mommy.

3
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,584
Night-night.

4
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,297
Sleep tight.

5
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,677
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

6
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,891
I'll see you in the morning light.

7
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,445
I love you.

8
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:06,720
They're going to make me an assistant
art director. So Kenny says:

9
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:09,431
"You get yourself a Burberry coat.

10
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,310
If you're gonna be Madison Avenue,
you have to look it."

11
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:16,063
Saturday afternoon, I go out,
and it's cold.

12
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:19,358
I go to this place
that specializes in Burberrys...

13
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,319
...and say, " I want a Burberry coat,
37 short."

14
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:25,447
They put it on,
and I look beautiful in it.

15
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,907
I say, " I'll buy it."

16
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,326
And right then, I start to sweat.

17
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:33,622
I take my checkbook out, start to
sign the check, and my hand shakes...

18
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,708
...because I'm so scared.

19
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,418
- Good night.
- Where you going?

20
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:41,463
- I gotta get home.
- Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

21
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,007
Okay, so let me finish.

22
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,801
So I sign it,
and my hand starts shaking...

23
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:50,931
Who is this? Danny, right?
Taxi!

24
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:55,477
- Come on, I gotta tell you something.
- I can't. I gotta get home.

25
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:58,397
Gotta talk to you
about something important.

26
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:02,109
I'm putting you in charge
of the Mid-Atlantic account.

27
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:27,051
By the end of the year, we'll
have them up to 10 million.

28
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,554
If this campaign works out the way
I know it will...

29
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,681
...they'll offer me a partnership.

30
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,266
That's terrific!

31
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:38,854
When that happens, I just want you
to know I'm taking you along.

32
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:44,109
Wow! Wow! That's terrific.

33
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,629
Joanna.

34
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,006
I'm home.

35
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:12,429
I forgot my keys. I gotta call
the office before they go.

36
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,183
Jo, you're gonna be real proud
of me. I got good news.

37
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,605
- Ted.
- One second. Let me just do this.

38
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:28,529
You know Jack Edwards in accounting?
He committed suicide.

39
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,823
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

40
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:34,910
I gotta get those photos from
the retoucher by tomorrow morning.

41
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,872
- I'm leaving you.
- Honey, please. I can't hear.

42
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:42,418
Okay, you too. Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.

43
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,503
Did you guys eat?

44
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:45,629
I'm leaving you.

45
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,467
Here are my keys.

46
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,846
Here's my American Express,
my Bloomingdale's card...

47
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:57,933
...my checkbook. I've taken
$2000 out of our savings account.

48
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,394
That's what I had when we got married.

49
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:03,439
- Is this a joke?
- Here's the cleaning, laundry ticket.

50
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,816
You can pick them both up
on Saturday.

51
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,527
- You. You have to pick them up.
- What's wrong?

52
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,573
I paid the rent, the Con Ed bill,
and the phone bill, so...

53
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:14,575
You really pick your times to...

54
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,666
I'm sorry I was late, but I was
busy making a living, all right?

55
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,754
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

56
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:29,089
So that's everything.

57
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:36,055
Enough, enough. All right?

58
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:38,265
What are you doing?

59
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,186
Where are you going? Just tell me
what I did that's so terrible.

60
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,729
- It's not you.
- Then what?

61
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,023
It's me. It's my fault.

62
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,983
You married the wrong person.

63
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,653
- I can't hack it.
- Let's just go inside.

64
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,947
I can't, I tried.
I swear...

65
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:56,075
Joanna, please, just... I'm sorry.

66
00:06:56,367 --> 00:07:01,455
- No, please don't make me go in there.
- I just want to talk.

67
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:04,250
If you do, I swear, one day...

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,002
...l'll go right out the window.
- Oh, please.

69
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,547
Come on, now. What about Billy?

70
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,887
I'm not taking him with me.
I'm no good for him.

71
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:18,806
I'm terrible with him.

72
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:21,934
I have no patience.

73
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,186
He's better off without me.

74
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:27,856
Joanna, please.

75
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:35,030
And I don't love you anymore.

76
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:38,993
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

77
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:16,780
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted.
Is my wife there?

78
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:20,159
Yeah. Joanna come in?

79
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:24,705
We had a little fight. I thought
she might have stopped by.

80
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:28,250
If she comes in, tell her to come up
or just give me a ring.

81
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:34,256
Don't worry. She didn't take
her suitcase. She won't get very far.

82
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:38,802
I got work to do.
If she comes in, tell her to call me.

83
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,436
It's about time.

84
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:53,317
Joanna, that's the most insensitive...
Hi, Margaret.

85
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:57,404
- She packed a suitcase?
- Look, it's nothing serious, really.

86
00:08:57,696 --> 00:08:59,657
She tell you where she was going?

87
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,660
- You tell me.
- How would I know? I wasn't here.

88
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,413
Clearly, you two had many
talks about my shortcomings...

89
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:09,625
...which I haven't been privy to.
And I'd love to talk...

90
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:13,170
...but I have a major presentation
in the morning...

91
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,257
...and I gotta get my work done.
So please allow me...

92
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:19,093
You don't realize
we have a serious problem.

93
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:22,263
Wrong. Me. I got the problem.
All you gotta do is...

94
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,890
...go out the door and go back to bed.

95
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,851
- The fact is...
- For six months...

96
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:31,689
...l've been spitting blood to get
this agency its biggest account.

97
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,024
And at five, we got it.

98
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:39,321
At eight, the vice president tells me
I'll be the next creative director.

99
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:42,116
I come through this door
to share with my wife...

100
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:46,036
...one of the five best days
of my life, and she looks at me...

101
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,914
...and tells me she doesn't want
to live with me!

102
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,047
Can't you understand
what she's done to me?

103
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,469
She loused up one of the five
best days of your life.

104
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:08,767
You're terrific. Boy, you're...

105
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:11,020
Thanks very much, really.

106
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,273
Sisterhood.

107
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:16,734
Thank you for coming
to cheer me up, but...

108
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,028
I didn't come to cheer you up.

109
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,155
I'm concerned about Joanna.

110
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:25,242
Maybe you can be concerned
in the privacy of your own apartment.

111
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:30,539
Joanna and I never had any problems
until you and Charley split up.

112
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,791
Oh, I don't believe you.

113
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,835
Just tell me the truth, okay?

114
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:36,712
Did you set her up to this?

115
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,881
No, I didn't put her up to this.

116
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,550
- Give her a little pep talk?
- No, I didn't.

117
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,802
Joanna and I talk a great deal.

118
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,180
And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.

119
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:50,935
And it took a lot of courage for her
to walk out of here.

120
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:54,188
How much courage does it take
to walk out on your kid?

121
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:09,889
Where's Mommy?

122
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,807
- What?
- Where's Mommy?

123
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:13,475
What time is it?

124
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:19,523
The little hand's on the 7, the big
hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?

125
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:26,405
Oh, God. Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
You want to know where Mommy is?

126
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:29,992
- She's supposed to take me to school.
- She told me to do it.

127
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:32,161
Okay, I'll tell you where she went.

128
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:36,040
You know when you and your friends
don't get along and fight?

129
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,876
And you want to go and be alone
for a while?

130
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:41,795
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don't get along...

131
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:45,758
...and one of them wants to go
and be by themselves for a while.

132
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:48,302
- When is Mommy coming back?
- Soon.

133
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:52,056
Now we are gonna have breakfast!
Okay? Just you and me.

134
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,475
- What do you want?
- French toast.

135
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,810
You want French toast, you got it.

136
00:12:57,061 --> 00:13:00,231
Put up a little water for Daddy
to have some coffee.

137
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:03,484
We got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.

138
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:04,777
We got milk.

139
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,445
We got butter.

140
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,531
We got $5.

141
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:11,200
I got $5.
Here, you sit here.

142
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:14,787
Okay, can you be my number one helper?

143
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:17,790
Watch this. One hand.

144
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:20,000
Here we go.

145
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:23,045
Did you know that all
the best chefs are men?

146
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:26,465
Isn't this terrific?
We gotta do this more often.

147
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:29,134
- You dropped some shell in it.
- That's okay.

148
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:33,013
Makes it crunchier.
You like it crunchy, don't you?

149
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:37,059
Why don't you beat them,
and I'll get everything else going.

150
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,311
- What time is school?
- 8:30.

151
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:43,691
Gotta get the show on the road.
I gotta shower, shave and shampoo.

152
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:45,025
I got people to see.

153
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:47,820
And Daddy's gotta bring home
the bacon...

154
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,530
...and he's gotta cook it.

155
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:52,992
We're having a good time!
Where does Mommy keep the...?

156
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,536
- In the stove.
- The pan. The stove.

157
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,373
First, we need a nice fire.

158
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,334
No, you're not doing it right.

159
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:06,046
Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It's the wrist.

160
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,173
So the gucky part dissolves.

161
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:12,136
Then you take the bread, and we...

162
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,054
We...

163
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,142
We fold the French toast.
That's what we do.

164
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:21,937
- I think you forgot milk.
- I didn't. Milk comes last.

165
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,900
When you're having a good time
you forget things.

166
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:29,778
I just wanted to see
if you're paying attention.

167
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:33,824
Fun, isn't it? When's the last
time Mommy let you in the kitchen?

168
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:35,576
I don't like it in pieces.

169
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:39,872
It tastes the same whether it's in
pieces or whole. Bread is bread.

170
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:42,541
Besides, French toast
is always folded.

171
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,003
In the best restaurants,
you see folded French toast.

172
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,214
You get more bites that way.

173
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,219
And while that's going,
Daddy's gonna make coffee.

174
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,054
You having a good time?

175
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:58,849
I don't remember the last
time I had such a good time.

176
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,727
Daddy's gonna make himself coffee.

177
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:04,355
- That's too much!
- No, I like it strong.

178
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,774
Mommy always makes it too weak.

179
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:10,945
Can I have some orange juice?

180
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,073
Right. One OJ coming up
for the kid.

181
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:18,077
Daddy, it's burning!

182
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:20,496
- What?
- It's burning!

183
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:25,459
Damn it! Goddamn her!

184
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,297
Oh, shit.

185
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,262
Just take it easy.
Everything is fine. We're terrific.

186
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:38,013
Just...

187
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:42,601
Just take it easy.
Nothing is the matter.

188
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:47,731
- What?
- Your hand's sweaty.

189
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:50,526
- When's Mommy coming back?
- Soon. I told you.

190
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:54,154
- Is she gonna pick me up?
- Probably. If she doesn't, I will.

191
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,240
- What if you forget?
- I won't.

192
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,827
- What if you get run over?
- Mommy will pick you up.

193
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:02,204
- Miss! What grade are you in?
- First.

194
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:04,957
This is Billy Kramer.
He's in first grade.

195
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,543
Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I'm late. Taxi!

196
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,753
Taxi!

197
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,426
- Congratulations about Mid-Atlantic.
- Thanks.

198
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:19,096
- Congratulations.
- Is the stuff back from the retoucher?

199
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,640
- Great news, Ted.
- Thanks a lot.

200
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:24,310
Morning. 11:00, meeting
with Airwick...

201
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:27,855
- Where's the stuff from the retoucher?
- Right here.

202
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:29,940
- Did my wife call?
- No.

203
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:33,485
You're gonna have to cancel
the Airwick at 11:30.

204
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,978
She's never gone this far before,
but in the past...

205
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:11,065
...l've known
when she's upset because...

206
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:12,942
...she gets very quiet.

207
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:16,737
Our pattern has been that I've said,
"What's the matter?"...

208
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,864
...and she'll kind of sit on it.

209
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:22,159
But in the last few weeks,
maybe couple of months...

210
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:26,330
...since we've been going crazy
with this account, I've been remiss.

211
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:31,961
And I just didn't look at the writing
on the wall, so she's kind of...

212
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:36,090
I think this is a way
of making me stop, look and say:

213
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,425
" I'm as important as your work."

214
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,763
Is there another guy?

215
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,560
I don't think so.
She's not the type.

216
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,646
She's got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs...

217
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:55,693
...you know, women's lib.
I think they may have cooked this up.

218
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,736
It worked.

219
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,489
I'm going crazy!

220
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,950
Look, not to worry.

221
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,743
She'll be back.

222
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:07,329
I didn't know it would happen to me!

223
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:09,832
Don't let it get you down.

224
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:13,544
I know she'll be back.
I'm terrific, really.

225
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,008
- You do have a problem, Ted.
- Yeah, what's that?

226
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:23,804
What are you gonna do about Billy?

227
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:29,518
This just happened last night.
I'm sure when Joanna comes back...

228
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:31,979
It's none of my business.
I'll butt out.

229
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,815
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

230
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:38,277
I appreciate you
taking the time to talk to me.

231
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:43,032
May sound a little rough, but...

232
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:47,620
...I think you ought to send Billy away
to stay with relatives for a while.

233
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:50,497
You mean, until Joanna comes back?

234
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:53,626
Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?

235
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:58,672
Gee, I don't know...

236
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:00,466
Ted, listen to me.

237
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:05,971
I just told the boys upstairs you're
handling the Mid-Atlantic account.

238
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:10,768
You know? A gig like that comes
along once every five, six years.

239
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,356
There's guys here eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.

240
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:18,943
This is important. Don't blow this.

241
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:23,030
I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 110 percent...

242
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:27,618
...7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that.

243
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,330
I can't be concerned about you
worrying about a kid.

244
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:35,543
First, you can count on me
25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

245
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,670
Because I'm not a loser, Jim.

246
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,756
I never let anything at home
come into the office.

247
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:43,300
You asked me to unload in this office.

248
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:47,221
When I go outside, I'm on top of it.
I want you to know that.

249
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:49,848
I'm a survivor.

250
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,894
You've given me a shot here.
I'm not gonna let anything blow it.

251
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,855
Okay?

252
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:02,069
Let's have a drink later.
I'm all right. I gotta...

253
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,530
...blow smoke up Airwick's ass, 11:00.

254
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:06,448
I'm all right!

255
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:08,117
You don't worry.

256
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,743
Thank you.

257
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:12,913
I love you, you bastard.

258
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,421
Daddy?

259
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:22,506
Daddy?

260
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:29,346
Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.

261
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,391
Let me get this copy done,
and then I'll talk.

262
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:36,854
What time is it when an elephant
sits on your fence?

263
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,399
Time to get a new fence.

264
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,530
Honey, please...
I just got this sentence.

265
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:48,199
Daddy! Daddy!

266
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:50,409
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

267
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,913
Get over there and sit
on that couch and don't move!

268
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:56,832
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!

269
00:20:57,082 --> 00:21:00,544
Who told you not to drink
this stuff here?

270
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:02,796
- Sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

271
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:05,674
Told you to keep that juice
in the dining room!

272
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,718
Sorry.

273
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:11,847
Who took you to the park, gave you
everything you wanted?

274
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:14,308
- Who bought you an ice cream?
- You.

275
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,479
And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you'd let him work?

276
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,150
- That's ruined. I can't fix that.
- Sorry.

277
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:31,909
It's past your bedtime.
Why don't you go to sleep?

278
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:40,251
And brush your teeth
and flush the toilet.

279
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:48,592
- Paper towels. What else?
- We need detergent.

280
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:49,885
All right.

281
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:53,430
No, Mommy buys the kind
with the orange circles on it.

282
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:56,725
- There's no difference.
- Mom said it was the best.

283
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,232
- Let's go.
- Get the pink stuff.

284
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,819
All right, come on.

285
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:09,655
Okay. That's it.

286
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:12,783
We need some cereal.

287
00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:15,327
Okay, what colour?

288
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:27,381
Hey, Billy!

289
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:31,051
Billy! Told you Mommy would write
before the week was up.

290
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:35,306
- When is she coming back?
- That's what we're gonna find out now.

291
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,059
Okay. Let's read it.

292
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:47,651
" My dearest, sweet Billy."

293
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,822
That's you.

294
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:56,160
" Mommy has gone away.

295
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:58,871
Sometimes in the world...

296
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,414
...daddies go away...

297
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:03,292
...and mommies bring up
their little boys.

298
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:06,420
But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too...

299
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,757
...and you have your daddy
to bring you up.

300
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:12,301
I have gone away
because I must find...

301
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:16,430
...something interesting to do
for myself in the world.

302
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:19,308
Everybody has to, and so do I.

303
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,900
Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too...

304
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,070
...and this is what I have to do.

305
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:33,739
I did not get a chance
to tell you this...

306
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,784
...and that is why
I'm writing you now.

307
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:39,537
I will always be your mommy...

308
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:43,499
...and I will always love you.

309
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,710
I just won't be your mommy
in the house...

310
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:49,547
...but I'll be your mommy
at the heart.

311
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:54,051
And now I must go
and be the person I have to be."

312
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,267
We'll read this another time.

313
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:02,935
I don't care.

314
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,217
- Good night, Jim.
- Come on in.

315
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,802
- Have a drink.
- I can't, I'm late now.

316
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:22,765
What's the rush? We're having
a party for Norman. Five years here.

317
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:24,058
Can you believe it?

318
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,102
Wish I could, but I'm late.
I gotta pick up Billy.

319
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:29,271
You know Jerry Hoover, in media?

320
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:31,357
Tell you something funny.

321
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:33,234
Gotta go. See you Monday.

322
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,074
Taxi!

323
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:42,493
Taxi!

324
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:48,207
- Here, keep the change.
- Thanks.

325
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,894
Hi, Mrs. Kline. I'm sorry I'm late.

326
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,522
That's all right, but Billy is upset.

327
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:14,275
Hey, how's it going, sport?

328
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:18,737
I had a little trouble
getting away from the office.

329
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,574
Sorry. Come on, let's get going.

330
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:25,452
Thanks for coming, Billy.
Oh, wait a minute.

331
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:28,664
- Don't forget your goody bag.
- Thanks very much.

332
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,583
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

333
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:34,295
- So, did you have a lot of fun?
- You're late.

334
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:37,381
- I'm not that late. Only 20 minutes.
- Want to bet?

335
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,635
All the other mothers were there
before you.

336
00:26:44,722 --> 00:26:48,225
Why are you making such a big deal
of it? There was traffic.

337
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:54,440
If you want to be a big boy...

338
00:26:54,732 --> 00:26:58,569
...you learn that when somebody says
they're sorry...

339
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:04,033
...you don't hold a grudge
and make them feel bad for...

340
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:07,244
...a long time afterwards.

341
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:09,121
Okay, go ahead.

342
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:15,085
Don't eat with your fingers.
Come on, Billy.

343
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:18,505
You know better than that.
Here.

344
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:20,174
Use a fork.

345
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:26,055
Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

346
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:28,724
How was school today?

347
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,851
Same as usual.

348
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:33,354
I see the Knicks finally won a game.

349
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,397
I don't care.

350
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:37,191
What do you mean?

351
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:40,486
- I like Boston.
- Boston? Why do you like Boston?

352
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,113
Because Mommy's from Boston.

353
00:27:47,743 --> 00:27:49,703
Sit up and try to eat. Come on.

354
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:52,998
Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.

355
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:54,625
Too much birthday cake?

356
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,460
Yeah, I guess.

357
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,670
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

358
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:09,213
Louise, give me a hand.

359
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:10,881
You're 15 minutes late.

360
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,634
- Mr. O'Connor is very upset.
- This all of it?

361
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,972
- Yes. Do you want your mail now?
- No, just give me the messages.

362
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:21,600
Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.

363
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,185
Okay, okay.

364
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:24,311
Sorry I'm late.

365
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:28,816
And there's a PTA meeting
at the school on Tuesday at 4.

366
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:32,820
Right, thanks.

367
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:35,781
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

368
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,785
Know who Charley's seeing now?

369
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:41,036
Who?

370
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:45,583
A divorced woman with two little girls
the same age as Kim and Petey.

371
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,710
- Are you kidding?
- No.

372
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,919
How do you know?

373
00:32:49,211 --> 00:32:51,005
I know.

374
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:54,133
How long has it been since
you two broke up?

375
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:55,301
Year and a half.

376
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:57,761
That long?

377
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:00,055
Did I ever tell you how sorry...

378
00:33:00,306 --> 00:33:03,309
...how sad Joanna and I were
when you guys split?

379
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:07,855
Look at that cute little boy
over there.

380
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:10,316
You think you'll ever
get married again?

381
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:15,154
- I mean, to anybody.
- No.

382
00:33:15,446 --> 00:33:16,822
Why?

383
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:21,785
Maybe it's different if you don't
have children, but...

384
00:33:23,454 --> 00:33:27,583
...even if Charley and I aren't living
together, and even if we're...

385
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:32,838
...sleeping with other people, even
if he were to get married again...

386
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:35,758
...he's still my husband...

387
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,136
...and he's still the father of my
children and...

388
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:44,975
That stuff about "till death do you
part," that's really true.

389
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:48,854
Let's say Charley finishes
his midlife crisis...

390
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:53,067
...he's had it with his flings
and comes asking for forgiveness.

391
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:54,944
What would you do?

392
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:04,036
I think that if he really loved me...

393
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:06,705
...he wouldn't have let me
divorce him.

394
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:18,092
You still think about him, don't you?

395
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:21,679
Only all the time.

396
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:31,438
- Think about Joanna?
- Never.

397
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:35,860
Liar.

398
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:40,197
Some pair, boy.

399
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,908
I don't believe it.

400
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,536
- You missed the closing.
- I'm sorry.

401
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:50,124
Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm getting very nervous here.

402
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:53,502
Ever since your wife left you.
Is it eight months now?

403
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:55,462
You're not getting any better.

404
00:34:55,754 --> 00:34:56,797
What do you mean?

405
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:02,303
Look, I can't let your family problems
interfere with my responsibilities.

406
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:03,762
I got a shop to run.

407
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:07,641
I regret it, and I promise you
it will never happen again.

408
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:09,184
Okay?

409
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,398
Yeah?

410
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:17,651
Yeah, wait a minute.

411
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:20,154
- It's for you, pick up 461.
- Who is it?

412
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:22,740
Pick up 461.

413
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,744
Yeah?

414
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:30,039
Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?

415
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:33,834
No, one hour of television a day.
That's the rule.

416
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:35,669
No.

417
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:40,424
I don't care what the other
mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.

418
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,760
I can't talk now. I'm busy.

419
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:47,431
We will talk about it tonight
when I get home, all right?

420
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:50,267
Double chocolate chip. I remember.

421
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:56,190
I'm getting very nervous.

422
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:05,282
Put that down and eat your dinner.

423
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:06,909
What is this crap?

424
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:10,037
- It's Salisbury steak.
- I hate it.

425
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:12,790
You had it last week and you loved it.

426
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,502
No, I didn't. I hate the brown
stuff. It's gross.

427
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:19,129
- It's onions and gravy.
- I'm allergic to onions.

428
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:21,799
You are not.
You had this last week...

429
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:26,053
...and I said it was my favourite and you
said, " It's my favourite too."

430
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:28,013
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

431
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:30,474
It's regular hamburger.

432
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,393
Take a bite. It's delicious.

433
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:35,437
What's the matter?

434
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:37,106
I'm gonna throw up.

435
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:39,441
- No, you're not.
- It's yucky.

436
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:42,611
It is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.

437
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:50,494
Did you bring the chocolate chip
ice cream home?

438
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:54,498
Yes, I brought the chocolate chip
ice cream home...

439
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,210
...and you can't have it until
you eat all your dinner...

440
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:01,338
Where are you going?
Get back here now.

441
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:02,965
Did you hear me?

442
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:04,383
You'd better not do that.

443
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,970
You'd better stop right there.
I'm warning you.

444
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,016
Did you hear me?

445
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:17,688
Now, you listen to me.
Don't be smart.

446
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:20,357
Put that back until you finish
your dinner.

447
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:26,197
If you take one bite out of that,
you're in trouble.

448
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,076
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare do that.

449
00:37:31,368 --> 00:37:33,162
You hear me? Hold it right there.

450
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:38,500
You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very big trouble.

451
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:42,046
Don't you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down.

452
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:46,467
I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.

453
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:50,763
You're hurting me!

454
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:52,723
Don't you kick me.

455
00:37:53,766 --> 00:37:56,519
- I hate you!
- You're no bargain either, pal.

456
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:59,021
You are a spoiled little brat!

457
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:02,066
- I hate you!
- I hate you back, you little shit!

458
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:05,694
- I want my mommy!
- I'm all you've got.

459
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:10,824
I want my mommy!

460
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:16,830
I want my mommy!

461
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:26,215
I want my mommy!

462
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:29,176
Mommy...

463
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:23,981
Daddy?

464
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:26,233
Daddy?

465
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:28,569
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

466
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:31,197
I'm sorry too.

467
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:37,369
I want you to go to sleep
because it's really late.

468
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:40,039
Daddy?

469
00:39:40,873 --> 00:39:41,999
Now what is it?

470
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,251
Are you going away?

471
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,086
No.

472
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:50,257
I'm staying here with you.
You can't get rid of me that easy.

473
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:53,802
That's why Mommy left, isn't it?
Because I was bad?

474
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:57,223
Is that what you think?

475
00:39:58,933 --> 00:39:59,767
No.

476
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:05,272
That's not it, Billy.
Your mom loves you very much...

477
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:09,235
...and the reason she left has
nothing to do with you.

478
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:16,242
I don't know if this will make sense,
but I'll try to explain it to you.

479
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:21,997
I think the reason why Mommy left...

480
00:40:22,998 --> 00:40:24,708
...was because for a long time...

481
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:30,047
...I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person.

482
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:35,803
A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.

483
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:39,139
And she just wasn't like that.
She was...

484
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:42,017
She just wasn't like that.

485
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:49,608
I think that she tried for so long
to make me happy...

486
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:53,863
...and when she couldn't,
she tried to talk to me about it.

487
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,826
But I wasn't listening.
I was too busy, too wrapped up...

488
00:40:59,118 --> 00:41:01,328
...just thinking about myself.

489
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,458
And I thought that anytime
I was happy, she was happy.

490
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:10,921
But I think underneath
she was very sad.

491
00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:17,344
Mommy stayed here longer than she
wanted because she loves you so much.

492
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:22,474
And the reason why Mommy
couldn't stay anymore...

493
00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:25,019
...was because she couldn't stand me.

494
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:28,731
She didn't leave because of you.
She left because of me.

495
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:48,292
Go to sleep now because
it's really late, okay?

496
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:51,420
Good night.

497
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:54,423
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

498
00:41:54,673 --> 00:41:56,217
See you in the morning light.

499
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:58,427
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

500
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:01,847
I love you.

501
00:42:04,058 --> 00:42:05,601
I love you too.

502
00:42:23,953 --> 00:42:26,789
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

503
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:33,337
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

504
00:42:34,004 --> 00:42:36,257
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

505
00:42:36,882 --> 00:42:40,844
- With gruesome goblins.
- With gruesome goblins.

506
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:43,222
And ghostly ghosts.

507
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:47,226
And wicked witches and spooky spooks.

508
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:05,077
Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.

509
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:09,248
Look, it doesn't make any difference.
It's name or likeness.

510
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,210
I don't care. Tell them if they
want it, they have to pay for it.

511
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:15,045
All right, bye-bye.

512
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:16,505
Hello, Kramer.

513
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,966
Can you check the copy
on Mid-Atlantic?

514
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:20,926
I think it's okay.

515
00:43:31,729 --> 00:43:32,605
Yes.

516
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:36,150
Yes, what?

517
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:40,237
I'll have dinner with you.

518
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:48,454
Thank you.

519
00:43:49,205 --> 00:43:50,664
You're welcome.

520
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:15,940
Oh, shit!

521
00:44:16,273 --> 00:44:17,900
- I gotta go.
- What's the matter?

522
00:44:18,442 --> 00:44:19,276
I gotta go.

523
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:22,571
- Want me to call a cab?
- No, I've got an 8:00 meeting.

524
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,323
- Where you going?
- Bathroom.

525
00:44:24,573 --> 00:44:26,909
That's a closet.
Bathroom's over there.

526
00:44:27,493 --> 00:44:29,119
Yeah, you're right.

527
00:44:29,411 --> 00:44:34,291
These morons are violating the FTC
regulations, and I have to make sure...

528
00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:37,628
Hi.

529
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:41,924
- What's your name?
- I'm Phyllis Bernard.

530
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,050
Who?

531
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:47,388
I'm a friend, uh, business associate
of your father's.

532
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:50,015
Oh, Jesus.

533
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:55,062
- Do you like fried chicken?
- Fried chicken? Very much.

534
00:44:55,354 --> 00:44:56,397
So do I.

535
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:01,569
Well, it's really...

536
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:04,905
It's nice seeing you and...

537
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:06,323
- Bye.
- Bye.

538
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,621
Kramer, I just met your son.

539
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:17,251
Come on, you're never going to do
this if you don't concentrate.

540
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:22,673
All right, come on. Thattaboy.
Get your centre.

541
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:24,592
Okay? How's it feel?

542
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:25,843
Good.

543
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:30,264
Keep it going, keep it going!
That's terrific!

544
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:33,976
Don't stop! Billy, keep your
feet moving!

545
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:37,271
Oh, that's terrific.
How do you feel?

546
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:39,690
- Good!
- You look great!

547
00:45:46,697 --> 00:45:48,949
Don't go too far!

548
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:56,290
- Yeah?
- And so the dog really hurt Tom.

549
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,211
So Tom got so mad, he jumped in
the potato salad...

550
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:02,588
...and he pushed over the table.

551
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:03,714
Yeah?

552
00:46:04,006 --> 00:46:05,633
- Then...
- Let me get your shoelace.

553
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:07,009
Then what happened?

554
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:11,639
The big dog kept chasing him,
then he flipped the table.

555
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:13,974
- With all the stuff coming down?
- Yeah.

556
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:15,309
Then what happened?

557
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:17,728
I don't want to be late for school.

558
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,980
Here's your homework. Give me a kiss.

559
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:23,025
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

560
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:32,952
Taxi!

561
00:46:35,496 --> 00:46:36,705
Hi.

562
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:49,468
Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.

563
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:51,262
Tell me where you were.

564
00:46:51,512 --> 00:46:52,471
Well...

565
00:46:53,848 --> 00:46:57,101
...my French professor finally
asked me out.

566
00:46:57,393 --> 00:46:59,520
- When?
- The other day.

567
00:46:59,895 --> 00:47:00,813
You had a date.

568
00:47:01,146 --> 00:47:03,190
I knew you were keeping
something from me!

569
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,610
- I thought he was a pretty neat guy.
- Right.

570
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,737
- So we go to dinner.
- Yeah?

571
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:10,906
I find out he's married.

572
00:47:11,657 --> 00:47:13,701
He's deep in analysis.

573
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,454
- He's telling me his life story...
- Wonderful!

574
00:47:17,746 --> 00:47:20,291
...and all I can think of
while I sit there...

575
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:23,627
...is that I'm paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour...

576
00:47:23,961 --> 00:47:25,838
...to listen to his problems.

577
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:28,757
Daddy! Daddy, look!

578
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:31,135
- Take that out of your hand.
- I'll get him.

579
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:33,637
Did you hear me?

580
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:41,812
Hold it, hold it!

581
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:45,983
It hurts, Daddy.

582
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:50,696
- Daddy, hurry.
- Okay.

583
00:47:55,826 --> 00:47:57,703
- I can't see, Daddy.
- Rest your head.

584
00:47:58,954 --> 00:48:00,331
Watch it!

585
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,877
Daddy, please hurry.

586
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:07,588
- We're almost there.
- Can't see in my eye.

587
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,217
Let me see.
Where's the emergency room?!

588
00:48:19,892 --> 00:48:21,268
How did this happen?

589
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:23,395
He fell off the jungle gym.

590
00:48:24,313 --> 00:48:25,523
He had a plane in his hand.

591
00:48:25,773 --> 00:48:27,024
I'm just about through.

592
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:29,235
- Don't hurt him.
- I won't hurt him.

593
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:32,196
Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?

594
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:33,822
Yeah. Can she come in?

595
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:35,032
Margaret, come in.

596
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:37,535
- Stay, Daddy.
- I'll be right back.

597
00:48:37,785 --> 00:48:40,621
- Daddy, stay.
- I'm just outside.

598
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:42,206
It's all right, darling.

599
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,999
I'm just talking to the doctor.

600
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,335
He'll be right back.

601
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:47,503
I'm right here.

602
00:48:48,712 --> 00:48:49,755
Will he lose his eye?

603
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:53,425
No, but I have to take some stitches.

604
00:48:53,717 --> 00:48:54,635
How many?

605
00:48:55,761 --> 00:48:56,971
- About 10.
- What?

606
00:48:57,263 --> 00:49:00,808
Don't worry. There won't be
much of a scar.

607
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:04,270
This will take about 15 minutes,
so step over here.

608
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:05,938
I want to be in there with him.

609
00:49:06,188 --> 00:49:08,858
- You don't need to be in there.
- He's my son.

610
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,069
If you're gonna do something,
I'm gonna be with him.

611
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:15,239
Good boy. You're really brave.

612
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:27,668
That was a big one.

613
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:35,718
Stop it.

614
00:49:42,683 --> 00:49:47,771
Okay, we're almost done now.
We're almost done now.

615
00:50:29,188 --> 00:50:29,980
How is he?

616
00:50:30,356 --> 00:50:33,442
He's okay. He's sleeping.

617
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:36,153
It's okay. I can do that.

618
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,991
Ted, I'm so sorry.
I feel responsible.

619
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:42,868
I don't know what happened.

620
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:46,997
One minute he was there and the
next he was lying on the ground.

621
00:50:48,249 --> 00:50:49,708
Come on, Margaret.

622
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:53,254
Now listen, I want
to ask you a favour, okay?

623
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:56,340
It's a big favour.

624
00:50:56,757 --> 00:51:00,261
If something happened to me...
I'm not saying anything will...

625
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:02,972
...but if a building fell on me...

626
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,393
...would you consider
taking care of Billy?

627
00:51:11,689 --> 00:51:15,192
I want you to know that I put
some thought into this...

628
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:16,277
...and I...

629
00:51:17,236 --> 00:51:20,155
...can't think of anybody else
I would trust with him.

630
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:23,492
I know you'd be okay
with him because...

631
00:51:25,286 --> 00:51:26,996
...you're a good mother.

632
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,712
You're a lousy dishwasher.

633
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:38,841
- All right?
- Okay.

634
00:51:48,142 --> 00:51:49,768
You're all right.

635
00:52:04,283 --> 00:52:06,243
Louise, you want to get that?

636
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,999
Louise, it's ringing...
Yeah, hello.

637
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,793
Yes, who is this?

638
00:52:19,173 --> 00:52:20,132
Joanna.

639
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:40,223
Hi.

640
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:43,184
- Hi.
- How are you?

641
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:44,685
You look great.

642
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:48,231
- How's your...?
- What?

643
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,984
- I'm sorry.
- I was saying, how's your job?

644
00:52:52,276 --> 00:52:54,612
Fine. Vice president of nothing.

645
00:52:54,904 --> 00:52:56,072
No, really, it's great.

646
00:52:56,364 --> 00:52:58,658
- Would you like a drink?
- Whatever she has.

647
00:52:58,908 --> 00:52:59,951
- White wine.
- Wine.

648
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,536
- How's Billy?
- He's terrific.

649
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,916
He had a little accident in a
playground. He cut himself.

650
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:10,169
It was scary.
I ran him to the hospital.

651
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:12,672
He has a little scar,
but he'll be fine.

652
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:15,258
I've been worrying
that it's my fault...

653
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,803
Don't do that. You can't even
see it from a distance.

654
00:53:22,348 --> 00:53:26,561
I sit in the coffee shop across
from his school and watch him.

655
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:28,187
He got so big.

656
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:29,855
You've been watching him?

657
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,233
I've been in New York for
about two months now.

658
00:53:32,483 --> 00:53:33,693
I didn't know that.

659
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:35,987
Anyway...

660
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:39,282
That's why I wanted
to talk to you today.

661
00:53:40,157 --> 00:53:44,954
Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad...

662
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:46,956
- Shaky?
- Really bad shape.

663
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:48,749
Yeah, I was.

664
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,126
I was.

665
00:53:51,168 --> 00:53:53,296
Well, you look lovely now.

666
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,050
- What?
- I have a whole speech.

667
00:53:58,342 --> 00:53:59,802
Go ahead.

668
00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:06,350
All my life I've felt like...

669
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,770
...somebody's wife or mother
or daughter.

670
00:54:10,062 --> 00:54:13,941
Even when we were together
I never knew who I was.

671
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:15,943
That's why I had to go away.

672
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:19,572
In California, I think I found myself.

673
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,324
I got myself a job.

674
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:24,619
I got myself a therapist,
a really good one.

675
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:30,416
And I feel better about myself
than I ever have in my whole life.

676
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,960
I learned a lot about myself.

677
00:54:34,378 --> 00:54:35,296
Such as?

678
00:54:37,465 --> 00:54:41,594
No, really, I'd really like to
know what you learned.

679
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:50,728
I've learned
that I love my little boy.

680
00:54:52,063 --> 00:54:55,233
And that I'm capable of taking
care of him.

681
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:56,943
What do you mean?

682
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:00,655
I want my son.

683
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:02,698
You can't have him.

684
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,243
Don't get defensive. Don't bully me.

685
00:55:05,534 --> 00:55:06,911
I'm not getting defensive.

686
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,996
Who walked out 15 months ago?

687
00:55:09,288 --> 00:55:11,457
I don't care. I'm still his mother.

688
00:55:11,832 --> 00:55:13,000
From 3000 miles away.

689
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:16,420
Because you sent post cards gives
you the right to come back?

690
00:55:16,671 --> 00:55:18,464
I never stopped wanting him.

691
00:55:18,673 --> 00:55:20,299
What makes you sure he wants you?

692
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:22,510
What makes you sure he doesn't?

693
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:27,014
We're gonna sit here and
bat this back and forth.

694
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,392
- It's like old times.
- You can't deny me...

695
00:55:29,642 --> 00:55:32,812
Don't tell me what I can or cannot do.

696
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:36,315
- Don't talk to me that way.
- I anticipated this.

697
00:55:36,607 --> 00:55:38,901
Do what you have to.
I'll do what I have to.

698
00:55:39,193 --> 00:55:40,319
I'm sorry about this.

699
00:55:40,778 --> 00:55:42,405
Do what you have to do.

700
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,749
I don't know the legal jargon for it,
but I think it's "desertion. "

701
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:59,171
I don't mean to tell you your job,
but I have an open-and-shut case.

702
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:03,676
There's no such thing as an open-and-
shut case where custody is involved.

703
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:07,388
I'll bet your ex-wife
has already found a lawyer...

704
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,600
...who's advised her to move back
to establish residency.

705
00:56:10,892 --> 00:56:15,021
The burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

706
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,774
That means I'll have to play rough.
If I play rough...

707
00:56:19,066 --> 00:56:22,320
...you can bet they will too.
Can you take that?

708
00:56:22,528 --> 00:56:23,529
Yes.

709
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,574
And it's going to cost you $15,000.

710
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:29,535
That's if we win.

711
00:56:29,911 --> 00:56:32,496
If we go to appeal,
it'll cost you more.

712
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:34,790
I understand.

713
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:38,794
Now, how old is the child again?

714
00:56:39,086 --> 00:56:40,630
My son is 7.

715
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:42,548
- That's tough.
- Why?

716
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,969
In cases involving a child that young,
the court tends to side with her.

717
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:48,471
She signed over custody.

718
00:56:48,763 --> 00:56:52,308
I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
but it won't be easy.

719
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,435
Do me a favour, will you?

720
00:56:54,727 --> 00:56:57,563
There's something I find useful
in matters like this.

721
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:01,817
I sit down and I write out all
the pros and cons on an issue.

722
00:57:02,109 --> 00:57:03,653
Write them and look at them.

723
00:57:05,363 --> 00:57:07,490
- I want you to do that, okay?
- Okay.

724
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,033
And after that...

725
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:12,954
...if you're really certain
you want to retain custody...

726
00:57:13,204 --> 00:57:17,750
...then we'll go in there
and beat the pants off them. Okay?

727
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:40,106
I love you, Billy. I know you're
sleeping and can't hear me.

728
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:42,775
I love you with all my heart.

729
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:02,169
Ted, you got a lunch?

730
00:58:02,503 --> 00:58:06,799
Hi, Jim. I don't know. I was trying
to work this idea out here...

731
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:09,343
Good. I'll pick you up at 1:00.

732
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:11,929
Okay, you got it.

733
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:15,766
So the other morning,
I'm at the refrigerator...

734
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,769
...getting Billy ready for school.

735
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:22,481
I'm just in my underwear
and he notices I've lost weight.

736
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,151
He comes in and pats me.
He comes to here.

737
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:29,322
And he says, " Daddy, you've really
lost a lot of weight. "

738
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:33,534
He looks up at me and he says,
"And it's all gone to your nose. "

739
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,663
He was so cute. You know?

740
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:38,873
You know, kids.

741
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:41,125
It's delicious, want a taste?

742
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,085
- I'm full.
- It's good.

743
00:58:43,336 --> 00:58:45,213
Listen, Ted...

744
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:50,176
...I had a call from a friend
of mine over at another agency.

745
00:58:51,302 --> 00:58:54,764
The Mid-Atlantic people have
invited them to pitch the account.

746
00:58:55,056 --> 00:58:56,057
Why?

747
00:58:56,307 --> 00:58:58,684
They're not happy
with what we're doing.

748
00:58:59,977 --> 00:59:03,481
I think you should have them over
and I'll give a little tap dance.

749
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:06,692
I got Norman working on it.

750
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,486
Norman?

751
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,699
You taking me off the account?

752
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,161
You don't like me anymore?

753
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:19,372
It's not quite that simple.

754
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:25,002
I think we're gonna have to
make a few changes here.

755
00:59:29,215 --> 00:59:30,841
You're firing me?

756
00:59:32,593 --> 00:59:34,804
Yeah, I'm letting you go, yes.

757
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:39,058
Why?

758
00:59:39,267 --> 00:59:42,520
Now, look, Ted, this is
a very painful thing for me.

759
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:46,857
I've been getting a lot of pressure
from the guys upstairs.

760
00:59:47,108 --> 00:59:48,985
There wasn't anything I could do.

761
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:51,445
I think it's better this way.

762
00:59:51,696 --> 00:59:52,822
If I took your stripes...

763
00:59:53,114 --> 00:59:57,910
...if I put you on a schlock account,
you'd hate it, and me for doing it.

764
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,997
This way it's a clean break.
That's the best thing.

765
01:00:01,372 --> 01:00:03,875
You know my wife is fighting
for custody?

766
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,460
You know that we're going to court?

767
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:10,047
Do you know what my chances are
if I'm out of a job?

768
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:12,842
I understand that you're upset...

769
01:00:13,134 --> 01:00:16,888
I don't want to beg, but I'm
asking you, please, as a friend.

770
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,390
I'm asking you.

771
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,185
You're an extremely bright guy.
You've got a hell of a talent.

772
01:00:23,477 --> 01:00:27,315
You're gonna land on your feet.
You're gonna survive.

773
01:00:27,648 --> 01:00:29,191
Teddy, look.

774
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:32,778
I know you may be short on cash.

775
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,448
No big hurry about paying this back.

776
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,575
Shame on you.

777
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:32,380
Daddy, the phone's ringing.

778
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:34,465
- Mr. Kramer?
- Yes.

779
01:01:34,715 --> 01:01:36,842
- Hold on for Mr. Shaunessy.
- Ted.

780
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,719
John. What's happening?

781
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:42,765
They set the court date.
I just heard today it's January 9th.

782
01:01:43,015 --> 01:01:46,769
I gotta tell you something.
I got fired today. They laid me off.

783
01:01:49,814 --> 01:01:52,733
Yeah, I'm still here.
Ted, I won't lie to you.

784
01:01:53,025 --> 01:01:56,612
We don't have a hope of winning
if you're out of work.

785
01:01:57,738 --> 01:02:00,074
Yeah, listen, you tell that...

786
01:02:00,825 --> 01:02:03,911
You tell that party and you tell
that party's attorney...

787
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:05,496
...that I want a delay.

788
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,498
Sorry, it's really too late.

789
01:02:08,165 --> 01:02:10,585
- Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours.
- How?

790
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:12,753
I'll have a job in 24 hours.

791
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:45,203
This is the worst time
to look for work.

792
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:49,081
It's the holidays. We'll have
something for you by mid-February.

793
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,542
- March, at the latest.
- I can't wait.

794
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,503
Mr. Kramer, it's December 22.

795
01:02:54,879 --> 01:02:57,381
If you could just look
in your card catalogue.

796
01:03:02,553 --> 01:03:04,347
I'll take anything.

797
01:03:07,475 --> 01:03:10,645
There might be something
at Norman, Craig and Kummel.

798
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,563
What is it?

799
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,482
Something in the art department.

800
01:03:14,774 --> 01:03:16,025
You'd go back on the board.

801
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:19,612
It's really a step down,
and a cut in salary of 5000.

802
01:03:19,904 --> 01:03:21,530
You'll be happier if you wait.

803
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:25,660
Call them up, make an appointment
for me today at 4:00.

804
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:27,495
It's the Friday before Christmas.

805
01:03:27,787 --> 01:03:28,996
It's still a workday.

806
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:31,040
Nobody's gonna want to...

807
01:03:31,332 --> 01:03:32,959
Either you call them or I do.

808
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:36,504
If I call them up, you don't get
a commission. Right?

809
01:03:36,796 --> 01:03:38,965
My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?

810
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:42,343
Yes, we are.

811
01:03:48,808 --> 01:03:52,144
- Good afternoon.
- I'm Kramer. I have an appointment.

812
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,231
I did all of the copy on that one.

813
01:03:58,359 --> 01:04:01,279
That was the most successful
ad campaign they ever had.

814
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:05,074
I did the idea, the layout
and most of the copy on that one.

815
01:04:06,534 --> 01:04:09,620
Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.

816
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,873
I'd like to get back to you.

817
01:04:12,123 --> 01:04:15,668
Is there someone I should see
before you come to your decision?

818
01:04:16,294 --> 01:04:18,254
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

819
01:04:18,504 --> 01:04:20,464
Why don't you let me see him now?

820
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:25,887
He's leaving on vacation. I'll set
something up the moment he gets back.

821
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:28,014
- I think...
- Have a nice holiday.

822
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,933
I'd like to see him before he leaves.

823
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:35,396
- Mr. Kramer, I don't...
- I want this position very much.

824
01:04:38,566 --> 01:04:39,483
Wait here.

825
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:12,016
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

826
01:05:12,266 --> 01:05:14,227
- How do you do?
- You got 10 minutes.

827
01:05:17,271 --> 01:05:21,984
You do understand that the salary is
$4800 less than you were making?

828
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:23,736
Yes, I understand.

829
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:27,823
Why are you interested in a position
for which you're overqualified?

830
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,367
I need the job.

831
01:05:30,243 --> 01:05:33,663
Let me think. I'll let Jack know
and he'll get in touch with you.

832
01:05:34,205 --> 01:05:35,665
This is a one-day offer.

833
01:05:35,873 --> 01:05:39,043
You saw my book,
you know I can handle the work.

834
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:43,381
You're gonna have to let me know today,
not at the end of the holidays.

835
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,342
If you want me,
make a decision right now.

836
01:05:53,307 --> 01:05:55,601
Could we talk privately for a moment?

837
01:05:55,893 --> 01:05:57,019
Yes, sir.

838
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:48,029
Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job.
Congratulations.

839
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:49,572
Really?

840
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,576
- Is he kidding?
- Welcome aboard.

841
01:06:53,868 --> 01:06:56,621
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.

842
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:16,682
Merry Christmas.

843
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,280
Come on.

844
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,995
- What do you think?
- It's neat.

845
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,581
- I told you.
- Where is everybody?

846
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:45,503
It's Saturday, so very few people
come in because it's a day off.

847
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:47,588
Okay, push " up. "

848
01:07:51,008 --> 01:07:53,219
Push the top button.
Very top button.

849
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,845
Go ahead, jump.

850
01:07:58,516 --> 01:07:59,684
- Look at that!
- Neat!

851
01:07:59,934 --> 01:08:01,394
You didn't know you were so high.

852
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:04,397
What building is that?
That has the pointy top.

853
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,107
That's the Chrysler.

854
01:08:06,399 --> 01:08:08,192
You proud of me?

855
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,694
How'd you get this job?

856
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:12,989
I told them I wanted it.
What's that say?

857
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:14,240
It says " Kramer. "

858
01:08:14,532 --> 01:08:16,492
Kramer. Who's that?

859
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:18,703
- That's us.
- That's right.

860
01:08:18,953 --> 01:08:20,329
You want to see?

861
01:08:22,081 --> 01:08:24,041
Wow!

862
01:08:25,293 --> 01:08:28,045
- This is neat.
- You like it?

863
01:08:28,629 --> 01:08:29,797
Careful, careful.

864
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:31,173
- I'm okay.
- Scare me.

865
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:33,009
What's that building?

866
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:36,012
That's the U.N. building.
That's the East River.

867
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:38,139
Look across there. You see that?

868
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:41,017
That's Queens.
Look way, way down there.

869
01:08:41,267 --> 01:08:42,643
- Know what that is?
- What?

870
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,605
- Brooklyn.
- Where you lived when you were a kid?

871
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,691
That's right,
and this is where I work.

872
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,820
Is this really your desk?

873
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:57,825
Are you gonna get remarried?

874
01:08:58,075 --> 01:09:00,119
I hadn't thought about it.

875
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:02,705
Are you gonna marry Phyllis?

876
01:09:02,914 --> 01:09:04,957
No, we're just good friends.

877
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:11,422
Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?

878
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,926
No, Mommy and me will never
be remarried.

879
01:09:15,468 --> 01:09:18,721
I bet if she saw this,
she'd remarry you.

880
01:09:20,932 --> 01:09:23,142
You're a con artist. We made a deal.

881
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:26,479
You take a bath every night...

882
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,732
...and you wash that filthy hair
twice a week, right?

883
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:31,067
- Right?
- Yeah.

884
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:32,485
Okay.

885
01:09:32,777 --> 01:09:34,153
Promise, or you're not going.

886
01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:37,323
Did I have to
when Mommy was here?

887
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,159
I don't care what you had
to do when Mommy...

888
01:09:42,036 --> 01:09:45,206
Did I, Dad? Did I?

889
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,543
Are you listening?

890
01:09:48,834 --> 01:09:51,671
We'll talk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?

891
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:53,506
Come here, give me a kiss.

892
01:09:54,549 --> 01:09:56,842
- What?
- You're a terrific kid.

893
01:10:03,182 --> 01:10:05,059
He says, "There's the unicorn. "

894
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:07,979
And he goes underneath there,
and he says:

895
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:10,439
" Crumbs, what's happening?

896
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:12,316
The air supply has stopped.

897
01:10:12,567 --> 01:10:15,111
Thundering typhoons,
what are you doing?"

898
01:10:15,403 --> 01:10:17,697
" Resting. It's tiring work,
you know. "

899
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,407
What's the air supply?

900
01:10:19,699 --> 01:10:23,119
When you got two tanks on your back
and you can't get any air...

901
01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:25,538
...you can drown,
so he's gotta have that.

902
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,039
Ted, John Shaunessy.

903
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,291
Hi, what's up?

904
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:32,753
I got a call from your wife's lawyer.
She wants to see the kid.

905
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:35,423
- She wants what?
- She's the mother.

906
01:10:35,715 --> 01:10:37,758
She's within her legal rights.

907
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:42,263
- How do I know she won't kidnap him?
- I don't think she'd bother...

908
01:10:42,513 --> 01:10:44,724
...suing if she's gonna kidnap him.

909
01:10:45,558 --> 01:10:48,394
Wait. I'm not so sure
about her mental health.

910
01:10:48,686 --> 01:10:51,939
- What do you mean?
- She said she was seeing a shrink.

911
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,149
A psychiatrist.

912
01:10:53,441 --> 01:10:54,817
Did you see her talk to walls?

913
01:10:55,067 --> 01:10:56,611
I'm just saying, you know.

914
01:10:56,903 --> 01:10:59,196
I'm just saying you don't
have a choice.

915
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:02,825
Have Billy at the boat pond
in Central Park, Saturday at 10.

916
01:11:03,117 --> 01:11:05,244
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

917
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:07,788
Thanks very much.

918
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,376
Daddy, will you come on
and finish the story?

919
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,671
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

920
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:22,803
What happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?

921
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:26,849
When you die, there's bubbles
that come up or something.

922
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:28,309
Where did I leave off?

923
01:11:28,601 --> 01:11:31,103
You left off right there.

924
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:32,980
"Thundering typhoons... "

925
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,818
It's got an obstacle course and stuff.

926
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:40,321
- The cars go really fast.
- How much?

927
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:41,614
It's really neat.

928
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:43,241
It's neat.

929
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,786
- Come here, I want you to look...
- Okay, okay.

930
01:12:02,176 --> 01:12:04,470
I'll have him back by 6.

931
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:06,806
You got so handsome.

932
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:07,783
Remember, we talked about it,
keep your answers short and succinct.

933
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:11,454
Just tell the truth and it'll be
all right. Believe me.

934
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,584
- She's here.
- Yeah, I know. I saw her.

935
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:20,630
Whatever you do, try not to become
emotional, no matter what he says.

936
01:13:20,922 --> 01:13:24,467
You'll hear things that may upset you.
I don't want you to react.

937
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:29,096
Persons having business with the
Supreme Court, State of New York...

938
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:32,683
...special term part five,
draw nigh and ye shall be heard.

939
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:37,688
This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.

940
01:13:54,705 --> 01:13:58,167
- Is the petitioner's attorney ready?
- I am, Your Honour.

941
01:13:58,459 --> 01:14:00,545
I would like to call Joanna Kramer.

942
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,547
Motherhood, going for the throat.

943
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,758
You swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

944
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:07,301
I do.

945
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:17,812
Now, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell
the court how long you were married?

946
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:19,188
Eight years.

947
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,733
And would you describe those years
as happy?

948
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,194
The first two, yes.

949
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:28,990
But after that it became
increasingly difficult.

950
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:34,245
Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job
before you were married?

951
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:38,040
Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith...

952
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:43,296
...I worked in the art department of
Mademoiselle magazine for years.

953
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:47,800
Did you continue to work
after you were married?

954
01:14:48,009 --> 01:14:50,094
No. I did not.

955
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:51,762
Did you wish to?

956
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:56,934
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...

957
01:14:57,184 --> 01:15:01,981
To my ex-husband about it,
he wouldn't listen.

958
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:06,777
He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.

959
01:15:07,153 --> 01:15:09,655
He said that I
probably couldn't get a job...

960
01:15:09,906 --> 01:15:12,491
...that would pay enough
to hire a babysitter.

961
01:15:12,783 --> 01:15:15,703
Tell me, are you employed
at the present time?

962
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,456
I'm a sportswear designer
here in New York.

963
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:21,167
And what is your present salary?

964
01:15:21,459 --> 01:15:24,045
I make $31,000 a year.

965
01:15:24,503 --> 01:15:28,007
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

966
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,344
Yes, I do, very much.

967
01:15:31,677 --> 01:15:34,513
And yet you chose to leave him.

968
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:36,807
Yes.

969
01:15:43,022 --> 01:15:46,609
During the last five years
of our marriage...

970
01:15:48,361 --> 01:15:50,863
...I was becoming more
and more unhappy.

971
01:15:51,572 --> 01:15:52,949
More and more troubled.

972
01:15:53,241 --> 01:15:57,203
And I really needed
somebody to help me...

973
01:15:57,495 --> 01:16:00,581
...but when I turned to Ted, he just...

974
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:03,709
...wasn't there for me.

975
01:16:04,335 --> 01:16:07,088
So we became more isolated
from one another...

976
01:16:07,338 --> 01:16:09,131
...more and more separate.

977
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,426
He was very involved in his career.

978
01:16:13,594 --> 01:16:17,723
And because of his attitude
towards my fears...

979
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:21,394
...and his inability
to deal with my feelings...

980
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,064
...I had come to have
almost no self-esteem.

981
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:29,277
I was scared and I was very unhappy.

982
01:16:29,527 --> 01:16:31,988
In my mind I had no choice
but to leave.

983
01:16:33,906 --> 01:16:38,703
At the time I left, I felt that
there was something wrong with me...

984
01:16:39,245 --> 01:16:42,081
...and that my son would be
better off without me.

985
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:48,129
And it was only after I got
to California that I realized...

986
01:16:48,421 --> 01:16:52,466
...after getting into therapy,
that I wasn't a terrible person.

987
01:16:55,261 --> 01:16:59,807
And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotional outlet...

988
01:17:00,057 --> 01:17:03,227
...other than my child,
that didn't make me unfit.

989
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:08,107
I would like to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist...

990
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,901
...Dr. Eleanor Freedman.

991
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:11,235
Objection, Your Honour.

992
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:15,031
The report is irrelevant
and not binding on the respondent.

993
01:17:15,323 --> 01:17:16,324
Overruled.

994
01:17:17,825 --> 01:17:21,454
Can you tell the court why
you are asking for custody?

995
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:25,458
Because he's my child...

996
01:17:25,917 --> 01:17:28,211
...and because I love him.

997
01:17:29,795 --> 01:17:31,881
I know I left my son.

998
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:36,093
I know that
that's a terrible thing to do.

999
01:17:39,597 --> 01:17:43,184
Believe me, I have to live with that
every day of my life.

1000
01:17:43,684 --> 01:17:45,895
But in order to leave him...

1001
01:17:46,562 --> 01:17:49,815
...I had to believe it was
the only thing I could do...

1002
01:17:51,776 --> 01:17:54,028
...and that it was
the best thing for him.

1003
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,989
I was incapable of functioning
in that home.

1004
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,200
And I didn't know...

1005
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:01,702
...what the alternative was...

1006
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:05,206
...so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.

1007
01:18:05,456 --> 01:18:09,001
However, I have since
gotten some help...

1008
01:18:09,335 --> 01:18:13,798
...and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whole human being.

1009
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:19,262
I don't think I should be
punished for that.

1010
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,849
I don't think my little boy
should be punished.

1011
01:18:24,308 --> 01:18:26,519
Billy's only 7 years old.

1012
01:18:27,478 --> 01:18:29,021
He needs me.

1013
01:18:29,981 --> 01:18:32,817
I'm not saying he doesn't
need his father...

1014
01:18:34,068 --> 01:18:36,737
...but I really believe
he needs me more.

1015
01:18:38,656 --> 01:18:43,035
I was his mommy
for five and a half years...

1016
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:47,999
...and Ted took over that role
for 18 months.

1017
01:18:52,378 --> 01:18:55,214
But I don't know how anybody
can possibly believe...

1018
01:18:55,506 --> 01:18:59,552
...that I have less of a stake
in mothering that little boy...

1019
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:01,971
...than Mr. Kramer does.

1020
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:07,018
I'm his mother.

1021
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,188
I'm his mother.

1022
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:17,612
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

1023
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:20,114
I have no further questions.

1024
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:24,702
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

1025
01:19:25,578 --> 01:19:30,124
...you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?

1026
01:19:32,293 --> 01:19:37,381
In all that time did your husband ever
strike you or physically abuse you?

1027
01:19:38,591 --> 01:19:39,800
No.

1028
01:19:40,051 --> 01:19:44,931
Did he ever strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?

1029
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:49,560
Would you describe your husband
as an alcoholic?

1030
01:19:50,978 --> 01:19:52,438
A heavy drinker?

1031
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:55,191
Was he unfaithful?

1032
01:20:02,573 --> 01:20:05,576
Did he ever fail
to provide for you in any way?

1033
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,540
I can certainly see why you left him.

1034
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:12,291
Objection.

1035
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:17,463
How long do you plan to live
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1036
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:19,382
Permanently.

1037
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:24,053
How many boyfriends have you had,
permanently?

1038
01:20:24,303 --> 01:20:26,472
Objection on grounds of vagueness.

1039
01:20:26,764 --> 01:20:28,140
I'll allow it.

1040
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:33,312
I don't recall.

1041
01:20:33,771 --> 01:20:36,232
More than three, less than 33,
permanently?

1042
01:20:36,524 --> 01:20:37,775
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1043
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,194
The witness will answer, please.

1044
01:20:42,363 --> 01:20:43,990
Somewhere in between.

1045
01:20:44,282 --> 01:20:45,825
Do you have a lover now?

1046
01:20:49,871 --> 01:20:53,583
Your Honour, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question.

1047
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,668
Does she have a lover?

1048
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:59,589
I'll allow that.
The witness will answer, please.

1049
01:21:01,382 --> 01:21:03,593
Yes, I'm seeing someone now.

1050
01:21:03,843 --> 01:21:06,596
Is that... permanent?

1051
01:21:08,472 --> 01:21:09,432
I don't know.

1052
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:12,226
We don't know
when you say permanently...

1053
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:16,731
...if you plan to live in New York,
or keep your child, for that matter...

1054
01:21:17,023 --> 01:21:21,777
...since you've never done anything
that could be regarded as permanent.

1055
01:21:22,028 --> 01:21:26,407
Objection. I request the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.

1056
01:21:26,657 --> 01:21:27,783
Sustained.

1057
01:21:28,075 --> 01:21:30,453
I'll put it another way, counsellor.

1058
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:34,749
What was the longest personal
relationship in your life...

1059
01:21:34,999 --> 01:21:37,543
...outside of parents or girlfriends?

1060
01:21:40,046 --> 01:21:41,756
I suppose that would be my child.

1061
01:21:42,423 --> 01:21:45,092
Whom you've seen twice in a year.

1062
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:49,013
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

1063
01:21:49,305 --> 01:21:52,975
...wasn't he the longest
personal relationship in your life?

1064
01:21:56,562 --> 01:21:58,814
Would you speak up?
I couldn't hear you.

1065
01:21:59,899 --> 01:22:01,108
Yes.

1066
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:03,194
How long was that?

1067
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:08,032
We were married a year
before the baby...

1068
01:22:08,741 --> 01:22:10,201
...and seven years after.

1069
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:14,247
So you were a failure at the most
important relationship in your life.

1070
01:22:14,497 --> 01:22:16,123
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1071
01:22:16,374 --> 01:22:19,293
The witness's opinion on this
is relevant.

1072
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:21,963
I was not a failure.

1073
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:26,092
What do you call it, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.

1074
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:29,053
I consider it less my failure
than his.

1075
01:22:29,303 --> 01:22:30,763
Congratulations.

1076
01:22:31,055 --> 01:22:34,850
You've just rewritten matrimonial law.
You were both divorced.

1077
01:22:35,142 --> 01:22:36,602
Objection!

1078
01:22:37,478 --> 01:22:40,940
Your Honour, I would like to ask
what this model of stability...

1079
01:22:41,232 --> 01:22:43,484
...and respectability
has ever succeeded at.

1080
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:48,948
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1081
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:56,289
- It did not succeed.
- Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

1082
01:22:56,581 --> 01:23:01,127
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1083
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:02,837
Were you?!

1084
01:23:08,509 --> 01:23:09,719
No.

1085
01:23:15,141 --> 01:23:16,934
Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

1086
01:23:24,442 --> 01:23:26,235
No further questions.

1087
01:23:30,198 --> 01:23:33,201
- Did you have to be so rough?
- Do you want the kid?

1088
01:23:33,492 --> 01:23:34,702
Daddy?

1089
01:23:35,661 --> 01:23:36,871
Daddy.

1090
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:40,166
- Yeah?
- What did you do when you were little?

1091
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,792
The same things you do.

1092
01:23:42,126 --> 01:23:44,503
Did you watch The Brady Bunch?

1093
01:23:45,129 --> 01:23:47,632
No, we didn't have any television.

1094
01:23:48,174 --> 01:23:49,717
You didn't?

1095
01:23:50,009 --> 01:23:51,719
We listened to the radio.

1096
01:23:51,969 --> 01:23:53,429
What else didn't you have?

1097
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:55,598
We didn't have lots of things.

1098
01:23:55,848 --> 01:23:57,850
- Like?
- Like a lot of things.

1099
01:23:58,976 --> 01:23:59,977
What kind?

1100
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:04,565
Come here.

1101
01:24:05,733 --> 01:24:07,276
We didn't have diet soda.

1102
01:24:07,568 --> 01:24:09,779
We had egg creams, which was
chocolate syrup...

1103
01:24:10,029 --> 01:24:12,448
...seltzer water and a bit of
milk and you went...

1104
01:24:12,865 --> 01:24:15,701
...and you drank it
and it was delicious.

1105
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:18,371
We didn't have the Mets,
but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.

1106
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:21,541
We had the Polo Grounds
and Ebbets Field...

1107
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:23,751
Boy, those were the days.

1108
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,003
We didn't have the Volkswagens...

1109
01:24:26,254 --> 01:24:29,840
...but we had all those different cars
with funny names on them.

1110
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:32,468
We didn't have Burger King
or McDonald's.

1111
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,056
We had automats where you put a
quarter in and you'd get...

1112
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:40,810
...a piece of pie or a sandwich
you could see through a window.

1113
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,980
We didn't have graffiti,
but we had this guy Kilroy...

1114
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:46,899
Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.

1115
01:24:47,191 --> 01:24:49,944
He spends a great deal of time
with Billy.

1116
01:24:50,611 --> 01:24:52,154
He reads to Billy a lot.

1117
01:24:52,405 --> 01:24:56,033
They play together,
they talk all the time.

1118
01:24:56,909 --> 01:24:58,619
He's a wonderful father.

1119
01:24:58,828 --> 01:25:01,664
Thank you.
No further questions.

1120
01:25:01,956 --> 01:25:05,042
Mrs. Phelps, how long
have you known Joanna Kramer?

1121
01:25:05,459 --> 01:25:09,338
About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the building.

1122
01:25:09,589 --> 01:25:13,134
How often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?

1123
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:17,889
I haven't seen them together now for
about a year and a half, but...

1124
01:25:18,139 --> 01:25:21,309
...back then I saw them two or
three times a week.

1125
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:24,186
My oldest daughter and Billy
play together.

1126
01:25:24,437 --> 01:25:28,566
Can you describe the relationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?

1127
01:25:28,816 --> 01:25:29,609
It was good.

1128
01:25:30,318 --> 01:25:32,028
Joanna was a very good mother.

1129
01:25:32,236 --> 01:25:34,280
Both Ted and Joanna are very...

1130
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,783
Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her
relationship with her ex-husband?

1131
01:25:38,492 --> 01:25:39,869
Yes.

1132
01:25:40,119 --> 01:25:42,955
Can you tell the court
exactly what she said?

1133
01:25:44,749 --> 01:25:46,959
Joanna wasn't happy for many reasons...

1134
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:51,756
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son's needs?

1135
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,179
Would you answer the question?

1136
01:25:59,263 --> 01:26:01,766
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, but that was before...

1137
01:26:02,099 --> 01:26:04,685
Did you ever encourage
her to leave her husband?

1138
01:26:05,186 --> 01:26:06,479
No, I did not.

1139
01:26:09,315 --> 01:26:12,818
Several days before she left,
did you say to her:

1140
01:26:13,069 --> 01:26:17,198
" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1141
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:21,744
- I didn't think Joanna...
- Did you say to her:

1142
01:26:21,953 --> 01:26:25,289
" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1143
01:26:26,624 --> 01:26:29,794
- Yes, but she was my friend...
- No further questions.

1144
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:33,256
Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.

1145
01:26:33,506 --> 01:26:36,092
Joanna, things are not the same now.

1146
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:37,927
Ted is not the same man.

1147
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:40,972
- You don't know how hard he's tried...
- Mrs. Phelps!

1148
01:26:41,222 --> 01:26:43,015
They're beautiful together.

1149
01:26:43,349 --> 01:26:45,142
The witness is asked to step down.

1150
01:26:45,393 --> 01:26:47,270
If you could see them together...

1151
01:26:47,478 --> 01:26:49,355
...maybe you wouldn't be here now.

1152
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:51,566
Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!

1153
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,656
I'm sorry.

1154
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,493
When you were talking...

1155
01:27:03,327 --> 01:27:08,040
When my ex-wife was talking about how
unhappy she was during our marriage...

1156
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:10,877
...most of what she said
was probably true.

1157
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:13,462
There's a lot I didn't understand.

1158
01:27:14,171 --> 01:27:16,841
There's a lot
I'd do different if I could...

1159
01:27:17,216 --> 01:27:20,303
...just like there's a lot you wish
you could change but can't.

1160
01:27:20,553 --> 01:27:23,890
Some things, once they're done,
can't be undone.

1161
01:27:25,057 --> 01:27:26,684
My wife...

1162
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:31,814
My ex-wife says she loves Billy
and I believe she does.

1163
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:35,151
But I don't think
that's the issue here.

1164
01:27:36,235 --> 01:27:38,279
If I understand it correctly...

1165
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:42,909
...what means the most here is
what's best for our son.

1166
01:27:43,451 --> 01:27:45,786
What's best for Billy.

1167
01:27:46,913 --> 01:27:48,789
My wife used to say to me:

1168
01:27:48,998 --> 01:27:52,251
"Why can't a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?"

1169
01:27:52,793 --> 01:27:54,337
I think you're right.

1170
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,839
And maybe I've learned that much.

1171
01:27:57,089 --> 01:27:59,467
By the same token, I'd like to know...

1172
01:27:59,759 --> 01:28:04,680
...what law says a woman is a better
parent simply by virtue of her sex?

1173
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:08,684
I've had time to think about
what makes a good parent.

1174
01:28:08,976 --> 01:28:11,812
It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience...

1175
01:28:12,063 --> 01:28:13,522
...listening to him...

1176
01:28:13,814 --> 01:28:16,484
...or pretending to listen
when you can't anymore.

1177
01:28:16,776 --> 01:28:20,029
It has to do with love,
like she was saying.

1178
01:28:20,363 --> 01:28:24,200
I don't know where it says a woman
has a corner on that market...

1179
01:28:24,492 --> 01:28:27,745
...that a man has any less
of those emotions than a woman.

1180
01:28:27,995 --> 01:28:31,249
Billy has a home with me.
I've made it the best I could.

1181
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:34,293
It's not perfect.
I'm not a perfect parent.

1182
01:28:34,585 --> 01:28:39,549
Sometimes I don't have enough patience
and I forget that he's a little kid.

1183
01:28:40,007 --> 01:28:41,384
But I'm there.

1184
01:28:43,052 --> 01:28:47,181
We eat breakfast and he talks to me,
and then we go to school.

1185
01:28:47,473 --> 01:28:51,769
At night we have dinner together and
we talk and I read to him and...

1186
01:28:53,062 --> 01:28:56,691
And we built a life together
and we love each other.

1187
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,700
If you destroy that...

1188
01:29:07,285 --> 01:29:09,620
...it may be irreparable.

1189
01:29:17,545 --> 01:29:20,464
Joanna, don't do that, please.

1190
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:25,511
- Don't do it twice to him.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

1191
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:27,388
No further questions.

1192
01:29:29,223 --> 01:29:31,559
How long have you
worked in advertising?

1193
01:29:31,809 --> 01:29:34,020
Ever since I graduated high school.

1194
01:29:35,396 --> 01:29:38,649
College, I mean.
I've been there about 15 years.

1195
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:42,904
Would you say you've achieved a
certain status in your profession?

1196
01:29:43,154 --> 01:29:45,198
Yes, I have a good reputation.

1197
01:29:45,489 --> 01:29:49,076
When you worked at Roth, Kane
and Donovan, what was your salary?

1198
01:29:49,327 --> 01:29:51,454
Around $33,000 dollars a year
when I left.

1199
01:29:51,662 --> 01:29:54,332
Now you work at Norman, Craig
and Kummel?

1200
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:56,500
- Yes.
- What is your salary?

1201
01:29:57,084 --> 01:29:59,295
It's almost 29,000.

1202
01:29:59,545 --> 01:30:01,923
Could you be more specific?

1203
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:04,550
I make $28,200.

1204
01:30:04,967 --> 01:30:06,928
28,200.

1205
01:30:07,595 --> 01:30:11,974
You're the only person who's working
his way down the ladder of success.

1206
01:30:12,225 --> 01:30:16,771
Objection. Your Honour, I ask that
counsel's last remark be stricken.

1207
01:30:17,063 --> 01:30:17,980
Sustained.

1208
01:30:18,189 --> 01:30:20,775
Is it true you were fired
from your previous job?

1209
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:25,696
- I was let go.
- Will you tell us why you were let go?

1210
01:30:26,155 --> 01:30:28,366
There was a difference
of opinion in policy.

1211
01:30:28,699 --> 01:30:33,246
Is it true your agency lost a major
account due to your negligence?

1212
01:30:33,746 --> 01:30:34,580
Objection!

1213
01:30:34,789 --> 01:30:37,542
I'm trying to establish
the witness's employment record.

1214
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:40,127
He cannot hold a job.

1215
01:30:40,419 --> 01:30:41,963
I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

1216
01:30:43,089 --> 01:30:46,259
It's not unusual in advertising
for a client...

1217
01:30:46,509 --> 01:30:48,678
...to change his mind
and go elsewhere...

1218
01:30:49,595 --> 01:30:53,182
Was it true you walked out on a
client during a major presentation...

1219
01:30:53,599 --> 01:30:56,602
...saying that you had an appointment
with a teacher?

1220
01:30:56,894 --> 01:30:59,981
My son was sitting next to a kid
who was hitting and biting.

1221
01:31:00,231 --> 01:31:02,900
- Yes or no?
- Yes, but he bit my kid.

1222
01:31:03,192 --> 01:31:07,321
Last spring, did you miss a deadline
on the Mid-Atlantic account...

1223
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:10,074
...causing your company a
great deal of embarrassment...

1224
01:31:10,324 --> 01:31:12,285
...and considerable
financial liability?

1225
01:31:12,535 --> 01:31:15,288
On that day I had to go home
because my child was sick.

1226
01:31:15,538 --> 01:31:18,082
Did you or did you not
miss a deadline?

1227
01:31:18,374 --> 01:31:20,418
- My son was sick.
- Answer the question.

1228
01:31:20,751 --> 01:31:23,921
I'm trying to answer the question.
It's not yes or no.

1229
01:31:24,881 --> 01:31:27,091
- Yes or no?
- He had a 104 temperature!

1230
01:31:27,341 --> 01:31:29,886
He's lying there sweating!
I go home to him!

1231
01:31:30,511 --> 01:31:34,974
Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

1232
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,690
I missed the deadline.

1233
01:31:43,524 --> 01:31:46,360
- Do you have a violent temper?
- No.

1234
01:31:46,611 --> 01:31:48,487
- Objection.
- I withdraw the question.

1235
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:51,782
- Do you consider yourself a fit parent?
- Yes, I do.

1236
01:31:52,074 --> 01:31:54,994
Is it true your child nearly lost
an eye while in your care?

1237
01:31:55,328 --> 01:31:56,871
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1238
01:31:57,121 --> 01:31:58,581
Answer the question.

1239
01:31:58,873 --> 01:32:01,083
He was in the playground,
on the jungle gym...

1240
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:04,295
And fell and nearly lost an eye
while in your care.

1241
01:32:04,545 --> 01:32:05,838
He fell and cut himself.

1242
01:32:06,088 --> 01:32:07,715
Is it true you told your ex-wife...

1243
01:32:07,924 --> 01:32:11,552
...you were responsible for the
injury that disfigured your child?

1244
01:32:11,928 --> 01:32:13,095
Did you tell her:

1245
01:32:13,596 --> 01:32:16,933
"When it happened I felt guilty.
I felt it was my fault"?

1246
01:32:17,183 --> 01:32:20,186
- Objection!
- I have concluded my questions.

1247
01:32:56,055 --> 01:32:57,056
Ted?

1248
01:32:58,683 --> 01:33:00,059
Ted?

1249
01:33:05,106 --> 01:33:10,111
I'm sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago...

1250
01:33:10,361 --> 01:33:13,447
...and I never thought he would
bring it up, never.

1251
01:33:14,991 --> 01:33:16,367
Believe me.

1252
01:33:17,243 --> 01:33:21,539
I never would have mentioned it if
I thought he'd pull a thing like that.

1253
01:33:22,623 --> 01:33:23,833
I'm sorry.

1254
01:33:24,292 --> 01:33:25,501
I'm...

1255
01:33:37,054 --> 01:33:38,014
Ted.

1256
01:33:38,347 --> 01:33:40,349
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, let me help you.

1257
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,809
Heard anything yet?

1258
01:33:42,059 --> 01:33:44,979
Any day. My lawyer says
no news is good news.

1259
01:33:45,229 --> 01:33:46,856
- Guess what.
- What?

1260
01:33:47,106 --> 01:33:49,650
Charley and I are talking about
getting back together.

1261
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:52,570
Really?
Did he finally call you?

1262
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,363
No, I called him.

1263
01:33:54,614 --> 01:33:55,740
How come?

1264
01:33:56,032 --> 01:34:00,161
I don't know. I got to thinking
about a lot of things since the trial.

1265
01:34:00,453 --> 01:34:01,412
And...

1266
01:34:02,205 --> 01:34:04,957
I don't think it'll work out,
but he seems to want it.

1267
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:08,461
That's terrific.
How do you feel?

1268
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:12,215
I don't know.
I feel scared, I guess.

1269
01:34:22,516 --> 01:34:24,393
- Hi.
- Hi.

1270
01:34:26,938 --> 01:34:28,147
I lost.

1271
01:34:29,565 --> 01:34:31,817
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1272
01:34:40,785 --> 01:34:42,036
What happened?

1273
01:34:43,412 --> 01:34:46,666
The judge went for motherhood
right down the line.

1274
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:51,879
"Ordered and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody...

1275
01:34:52,171 --> 01:34:54,423
...effective Monday,
the 23rd of January...

1276
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:59,679
...that the respondent pay for the
support of the child, $400 a month.

1277
01:34:59,971 --> 01:35:02,473
The father shall have the
following visitation rights:

1278
01:35:02,807 --> 01:35:06,477
Every other weekend, one night a
week to be mutually agreed upon...

1279
01:35:06,769 --> 01:35:09,605
...and one half of the child's
vacation period. "

1280
01:35:09,856 --> 01:35:12,066
- That's it.
- What if I fight it?

1281
01:35:12,316 --> 01:35:14,193
I can't guarantee anything.

1282
01:35:14,402 --> 01:35:15,778
I'll take my chances.

1283
01:35:16,028 --> 01:35:18,322
- It'll cost you.
- I'll pay anything.

1284
01:35:19,073 --> 01:35:21,659
Look, Ted, I have to
tell you something.

1285
01:35:23,035 --> 01:35:25,705
This time it'll be Billy that pays.

1286
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:28,040
I'll have to put him on the stand.

1287
01:35:28,541 --> 01:35:30,251
I can't do that.

1288
01:35:30,543 --> 01:35:32,503
No, I don't want to do that.

1289
01:35:35,298 --> 01:35:38,050
Thanks very much for your time.
I'm gonna take a walk.

1290
01:35:54,442 --> 01:35:56,903
Ted? It's me.

1291
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:03,367
Ted?

1292
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:05,494
I just heard.

1293
01:36:05,912 --> 01:36:07,538
Please go away.

1294
01:36:08,706 --> 01:36:10,666
Are you okay?

1295
01:36:12,251 --> 01:36:15,880
I just have to be by myself
for a while, Margaret.

1296
01:36:23,554 --> 01:36:24,597
I don't understand.

1297
01:36:24,889 --> 01:36:27,808
The problem is your mom and I
both want you to live with us.

1298
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:32,438
So that's why we decided to go see
this man, who is the judge...

1299
01:36:32,647 --> 01:36:36,025
...and we let him decide because
he's very wise and experienced.

1300
01:36:36,275 --> 01:36:39,904
We talked to him for a few days
and then asked what he thought.

1301
01:36:40,196 --> 01:36:42,448
You know what?
He agreed with Mommy.

1302
01:36:42,698 --> 01:36:46,285
He thought it'd be terrific
if you lived with her from now on.

1303
01:36:46,536 --> 01:36:49,956
I'm lucky because I get to have
dinner with you once a week.

1304
01:36:50,248 --> 01:36:53,251
And twice a month
we spend the weekends together.

1305
01:36:54,794 --> 01:36:58,047
Where's my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sleep?

1306
01:36:58,422 --> 01:37:02,468
Mommy's figured that all out. You
have your own bedroom at her place.

1307
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:06,430
- Where will all my toys be?
- At Mommy's.

1308
01:37:06,681 --> 01:37:08,891
We're gonna take
all your toys over there.

1309
01:37:09,141 --> 01:37:12,228
If you play your cards right,
she'll buy you some new ones.

1310
01:37:13,354 --> 01:37:15,606
Who's gonna read me
my bedtime stories?

1311
01:37:16,065 --> 01:37:17,608
Mommy will.

1312
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:20,778
You're not gonna kiss me
good night anymore?

1313
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:23,322
No, I won't be able to do that.

1314
01:37:23,573 --> 01:37:26,993
But, you know, I get to visit.

1315
01:37:29,537 --> 01:37:32,081
It's gonna be okay. Really.

1316
01:37:32,331 --> 01:37:34,750
If I don't like it, can I come home?

1317
01:37:35,042 --> 01:37:36,586
What do you mean?

1318
01:37:36,836 --> 01:37:39,005
You'll have a great time with Mommy.

1319
01:37:39,255 --> 01:37:41,591
Really. She loves you so much.

1320
01:37:42,133 --> 01:37:43,509
Dad?

1321
01:37:44,552 --> 01:37:48,055
Don't forget, once, if you can
just call me up, okay?

1322
01:37:54,562 --> 01:37:56,439
We're gonna be okay.

1323
01:38:01,277 --> 01:38:03,362
Let's go get some ice cream.

1324
01:39:43,045 --> 01:39:45,882
Come on, let's get
this show on the road.

1325
01:39:47,967 --> 01:39:49,927
Let's get a little hustle now, okay?

1326
01:39:50,136 --> 01:39:51,929
Come on, set the table.

1327
01:40:00,605 --> 01:40:01,731
Come on.

1328
01:40:13,492 --> 01:40:14,869
Are you ready?

1329
01:40:33,346 --> 01:40:34,180
Yes?

1330
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:36,974
It's Joanna.
I'm downstairs in the lobby.

1331
01:40:37,225 --> 01:40:39,685
Can you come down here
and meet me alone?

1332
01:40:46,776 --> 01:40:47,735
Hi.

1333
01:40:49,153 --> 01:40:50,321
What's up?

1334
01:40:54,784 --> 01:40:56,994
Tell me. What?
What's the matter?

1335
01:40:57,745 --> 01:40:59,705
I woke up this morning.

1336
01:41:03,668 --> 01:41:05,545
Kept thinking about Billy...

1337
01:41:05,836 --> 01:41:08,756
...and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room...

1338
01:41:09,006 --> 01:41:11,759
...with his little clouds
all around that I painted...

1339
01:41:12,051 --> 01:41:16,764
...and I thought I should have
painted clouds downtown because...

1340
01:41:18,474 --> 01:41:22,061
...then he would think that
he was waking up at home.

1341
01:41:25,314 --> 01:41:28,484
I came here to take my son home.

1342
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:35,157
And I realized he already is home.

1343
01:41:41,581 --> 01:41:43,916
I love him very much.

1344
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:51,632
I'm not gonna take him with me.

1345
01:42:00,558 --> 01:42:03,477
Can I go up and talk to him?

1346
01:42:03,769 --> 01:42:04,896
Yeah.

1347
01:42:13,029 --> 01:42:16,449
Why don't you go upstairs
and see him and I'll wait here.

1348
01:42:27,835 --> 01:42:29,378
How do I look?

1349
01:42:31,547 --> 01:42:32,506
Terrific.

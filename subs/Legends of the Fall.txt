- He...That would be
of a private nature"Private nature"?
It's a public office you hold, SheriffGentlemen"There came a low hiss,
a horrid soundthat made Rikki Tikki Tavi
jump back two clear feetAnd then out of the grassrose up the head
and spread hood of Nagthe big black cobra"I can read another storyThe Germans broke through
at ArmentieresThe British are trapped
in the Belgian lowlands- This paper is a week old!
- Calm downWith my fluent German,
I could become an officerAnd lead other boys to the slaughter
and be slaughtered yourselfThe men who served under you
worshipped youThey were all damn foolsThis is a turning point
in history- How can we...
- What?You can't expect us not to
be part of this- You taught us...
- To think for yourselves- And to defend what's ours
- Yes, what is ours!We've already lost two cousinsWho we've never met! Don't talk at me
as though I've never seen a war!Not a war like thisThey said that about the War
of Secession and the Indian warsThey say it to sell newspapersThese are not the Indian wars
We're fighting against naked aggression!There will be no more talk of wars
in this house! Damn it!I'm sorry, SusannahI'm going to Canada to enlistI'm going with himI'm sorry, my loveI meant to speak to you tonightI know you'll understand
It's the only honorable thing to doWhat's that?It's a book my father wroteto try to convince the government
to alter their policiestowards the Indians
in the DakotasSamuel won't change his mindChange it for himWhat happened between them?Father says
she never liked it hereI think they loved mostly the idea
of each otherDon't let him goI'll take care of himOctober 14, 1914My dear Isabel:Today our sons are leaving hometo defend an England
they have never seenI am unable to stop themI have tried to shelter our sons
from all the madnessand now they go to seek itBe carefulYou don't have to goGood-byeDon't worry, FatherTake careI'll bring you
the Kaiser's helmetBring yourself back
That would please me moreYes, sir- Take care of Samuel

is indescribableNothing is
as I thought it would beKeep your distance!
Keep your spacing!Tonight, as I prayed for the souls
of those who've died so terriblyyet so bravelyI admit that I also prayed
for personal gloryIs that wrong to want
to distinguish myself gloriouslyin combat as my father did?Tristan and Alfred
watch over me so carefullyI may never get the opportunityCharge!Alfred! Are you all right?Goddamn it!- Are you hit?
- It's just a scratchSusannah, I see nownot that my father was right,
but that I was naive- Let me up, damn it!
- Stay down!Fall back!Still, we place our bodies
in God's keepingWe go into battle honorablyfull of confidencewith His name on our lips- We're pinned here
- We'll wait- Give him a hand
- Help him downGoddamnSusannah:
I try to guard against despairbut there are moments when it seems
that all human decency is broken downAlfred will recover
from his woundsbut he and Tristan seem
to have drifted apart, or worseI cannot understand itI miss you more
than you can imagineYou are all that is clean
and cool and pureI close my eyes
and fix my thoughts on youI now regret that we listened
to everyone and agreed to wait to marryEven more, I regret that I left
before we could be togetheras we planned, my belovedPlease stay on at the ranch
and wait for meDon't let Father worryI know God's mercy
will protect meaided considerably
by Tristanwho seems to be in France
less to fight the Germansthan to act
as a nursemaid to meBe well, my loveYour own, SamuelCaptain needs me to translate
this before tonight's reconnaissance- Alfred will want to see you
- I'll be there- Yeah?
- Go onWhere's Samuel?He's translating
He'll be hereBoy, that's a good one- Vino?

up in the box canyonwhere he used
to draw the birdsYour son, TristanHe certainly was the best

of all of us, wasn't he?Good nightWhat you saw
before Samuel left...Please, don't...No, I want toIt is Samuel I lovedAll rightTristan will be back somedayYour father will be pleasedSusannah was to return to Boston
on the morning trainbut a norther blew
for three daysand drifted over the tracksThe Colonel insisted
she stay on until springThe house was too empty,
he saidThis was still her home,
he told herHe should have let her goBut how could he have known
what would happen?She was not to blameShe was like the water
that freezes in the rockand splits it apartIt was no more her fault
than it is the fault of the waterwhen the rock shattersYou know how much l...You know how much
I loved SamuelAnd I think you know...Out of respect for him,
I wanted to say it in this placeI think you know thatI'm in love with youFrom the first moment
I saw youlike in a novelThat's my mother's overblown
romantic imagination coming out in meYou're not making this
very easy for meSorryIs there any hope
that you could learn to love me?Not the way you love Samuel,
of coursebut enough to...We could make a life togetherA happy lifeI don't think soSounds like you're not sure, though
Maybe there's a chance?- What?
- I can only cause you pain, AlfredWhy don't you let me
be the judge of that?I didn't break it,
but I can fix itI can put the damn wheel back on
and take it off myselfGo take a nap- What?
- Look!I'm going into town if...Welcome home, sonI couldn't save himOf course you couldn'tIt's all rightHave a nice ride today?Excuse me, FatherTristan, pleaseWhen are you planning
to be married?Good morningDamn youYou will marry her- Make an honest woman of her?
- Yes!God damn you to hellYes, I will marry her,

- Couldn't save Samuel either, could I?Don't you dare say that
That was in God's handsWas it?Colonel! Lost a couple calves
near Camas Canyon- Might be a grizzly
- My grizzly?- You take him, Tristan
- Damn right I willI don't know why Tristan
did not kill that damn old bearThe Old Ones say:"When a man and an animalhave spilled each other's bloodthey become one '"I said four beers,
Mr. SachtlebenI said four beers,
Mr. SachtlebenAnd I said no Indians- He's quite civilized, I assure you

for some kind of a weaponIsn't that right?To split your stupid skull
and kill you and good riddanceLeave it!- Yes, sir?
- I want four beers, nowThe lousy owner says
he doesn't want to serve IndiansGet backDo you see this man?Do you?
His name is One StabHe's a venerated elder of the Cree and has
counted coup on hundreds of his enemiesHe is our friend
He's thirstyI think it was the bear's voice
he heard deep inside himgrowling low
of dark, secret placesWere you going to say good-bye?How long will you be gone?Not long
A few monthsI can make it better for youIf we'd had a childor if I were pregnant,
would you still go?YesJust give me a chanceDon't do thatLook at mePlease, look at meI'll wait for youHowever long it takesI'll wait for you foreverWill he come back?I don't know I don't knowStab says yesApril 20, 1918Dear Tristan:It has been months now,
and still no wordThe only sign
that you are aliveis a tattered parcel that arrived today
from New Guineacovered with strange writingand containing what appears to be
a native braceletMeant for me, I presumeBut perhaps notDo you still care to know
what is happening here?Cattle prices continue to falland winter seems never endingWhy don't you write?Are you never coming back
and afraid to tell me?Alfred continues to do wellHis business has expanded to include
financial concerns in Chicagoand WashingtonI don't pretend to understandHe wants us to send Isabel Two
to boarding school in Chicagobut she adamantly refuses
to leave the ranchI think she, too,
is waiting for youI have nowhere
to send this letterand no reason to believe
you wish to receive itI write it only for myselfI will hide it away with all the things
left unsaid and undonebetween usDecember 12, 1919Dear Susannah:I have become a hunterTell Stab there are creatures here
that cannot even be found in booksI have killed them allAll we had is deadAs I am deadMarry anotherColonel, it looks like
we've got company- I have come to ask for your blessing
- My blessing?You see, these gentlemen and...And a great many others,
I might addThey're urging me
to run for office- What office?
- The United States CongressThat's how highly
we think of your sonAnd what do you gentlemen
hope to get out of this?I beg your pardon?I've spoken plain English, sir
What do you want for yourselves?Father, I don't think
that these gentlemen...Didn't you ask that question
or do you believe these gentlemenback you out of patriotic duty
and your inestimable worth?You forget yourself, Father
I am no longer a childColonel, the Congress...Congress is government, sir
I worked for the government onceThe issues that we...Indians! Indians were
the issue in those daysThere is nothing so grotesqueas the meeting of a child
with a bulletor an entire village slaughtered
while sleepingThat was the government's resolution
of that particular issueI've seen nothing since then
to persuade me it's gainedin wisdom, common sense
or humanityGentlemen, my father, for whom
I have the deepest respectsays that the government
has neither wisdom nor humanityI will then consider it
my absolute duty as my father's sonto bring both wisdom and humanity
to the United States CongressI thank you for your blessing
Gentlemen- Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars
- Yes CertainlyAre you all right?
What's wrong?I don't know what to say
Tristan's always been wild- You love him for that
- Do I?I suppose I doHe does love youShe's to be your brother's wifeYes, though you better
remind him of that factHe's not here
to defend himselfNo, but I see you are here
to defend him and what is hiseven though
he's abandoned her and youI won't even speak
of who else he abandonedDamn you, boyDon't you blame my son
for Samuel's death!Samuel chose to be a soldier,
and soldiers diesent to their slaughter
by men in governmentParasites like you!Damn and blast you!Damn you
And damn you too!Shut your mouth
Leave her out of this!Get out of my house
and get off my landWhy? Because I want
to serve my country as you did?Or because, like you,
I love a woman who doesn't love me?He used her and deserted her,
your darling TristanAlfred, don't PleaseI loved her!I love her stillHe stole her from me
If you want to know the truthhe stole her from Samuel
before the warGod help me, I'll kill youHere
Read your darling Tristan's letterYou deserve to be happyLate that night we found
the Colonel on the floorbeside a cold fireHe could not moveHis hair turned white overnightand he became an old manAnd after that,
Tristan sent no more lettersAs the years passed bywe would hear that someone
had seen him on a shipgoing up some river
no white man had gone up beforeStories came to usStrange storiesAnd then, for years,
there was nothingHe was lost to usThat was all we knewBut every year,
in the Moon of the Falling LeavesBut every year,
in the Moon of the Falling LeavesI would dream that the bear's voice
inside him had grown silentand that Tristan might again
come to live in the worldBut then the winter would comeAnd then another springAnd still he stayed awayWhat the hell is he doing?She's a mean old bitch,
but she's yoursWelcome homeOld man!

they'll come after you for thisYeahYeah?I want to ask you
to watch over my childrenWatch over SamuelBrother, it would be an honorHow much I wanted
to take scalpsbut it was not my killThat night,
we buried the bodiesand dumped the car in a deep pool
in the upper MissouriI remember when he was a boyI thought Tristan would never live
to be an old manI was wrong about thatI was wrong about many thingsIt was those who loved him most
who died youngHe was a rock
they broke themselves againsthowever much
he tried to protect themBut he had his honorand a long lifeand he saw his children growand raise their own familiesTristan died in 1963in the Moon of the Popping TreesHe was last seen
up in the north countrywhere the hunting was still goodHis grave is unmarkedbut it does not matterHe had always lived
in the borderland anyway:Somewhere between this world
and the otherIt was a good death{{{the end}}}

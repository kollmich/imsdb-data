1
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:17,192
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

2
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,238
She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.

3
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:21,566
- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,534
Why don't you jam it down her throat?

5
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,412
It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:29,281
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,038
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:34,875
I won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.

9
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,503
Come now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

10
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:40,801
Not this time, you won't!
I'm already married to him.

11
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,213
You'll never live
under the same roof with him.

12
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:44,220
I'll see to it.

13
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:47,101
Get it through your head,
King Westley and I are married!

14
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:50,768
Definitely, legally, actually married!
It's over, it's finished.

15
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:54,141
There's not a thing you can do about it.
I'm over 21 and so is he.

16
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,776
While you've been onboard...

17
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,815
...I've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.

18
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:02,239
Annulled. I'll have something to say
about that and so will King.

19
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:03,701
I expect him to.

20
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,820
The vittles. Come in.

21
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:10,405
I told you not to bring any food in here.

22
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,700
Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.

23
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:13,998
Put it down here.

24
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:25,218
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,969
Strategy, my dear.

26
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:29,810
Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away...

27
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:31,437
...from the Justice of the Peace?

28
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,644
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

29
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,439
I've won many arguments that way.

30
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,859
Besides not liking him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

31
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:42,107
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best flyers in the country.

32
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:44,772
He's no good.
You married him because I said not to.

33
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,032
You're always telling me what not to do.

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,159
Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.

35
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:51,453
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.

36
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,625
Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.

37
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:57,332
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

38
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,501
All right, scream.

39
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:02,041
Let me off this boat or I'll break
every piece of furniture in here!

40
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:03,712
Here, now.

41
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:06,839
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.

42
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:09,007
Just smell it. It's a poem.

43
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:29,243
Lower the boats! Catch her!

44
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:31,621
Come on, men!

45
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,332
She got away, sir.

46
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,412
Of course, she's too smart for you.

47
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:42,543
Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.

48
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:43,712
"Daughter escaped again.

49
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:46,339
"Watch roads,
airports and train stations in Miami."

50
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:52,180
All aboard!
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

51
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:55,099
...New York, Philadelphia.

52
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:58,224
We're wasting our time.
Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.

53
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:00,059
I told the old man it was bunk.

54
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,771
Ticket for New York, please.

55
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:09,200
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:12,453
Thank you.

57
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,123
What's going on here?
I'd like to use that phone.

58
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:23,083
Go away. This is history in the making.

59
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:26,750
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

60
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:29,169
Heel, boy.

61
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:31,261
I can't stand this any longer.

62
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:33,390
In a pig's eye, you will.

63
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:38,469
Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound...

64
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:41,179
...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.

65
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,566
You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.

66
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:48,520
I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna write it in Greek?

67
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:49,944
I'd start a new department.

68
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:52,359
That was free verse,
you gas house palooka.

69
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:55,614
What was free about it?
It cost this paper a gob of dough.

70
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,497
And it's not going to cost us any more!

71
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,615
Gordon.

72
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,500
Did you know he reversed the charge?

73
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,412
What? Why you....

74
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:07,667
When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.

75
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:11,923
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.

76
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:14,765
What'd he say?

77
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,096
So, you're changing your tune?

78
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:23,809
You're late with your apologies.

79
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,649
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!

80
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,653
I hope this'll be a lesson to you.

81
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,534
Did we tell that baby?

82
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,610
- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete.

83
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,912
I guess he knows now,
how I feel about his job.

84
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,624
I bet he does, too.

85
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,369
Is my chariot ready?

86
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:46,581
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth,
mighty King.

87
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:51,004
- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.

88
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,962
Make way for the king.

89
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,845
Long live the king.

90
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:04,014
Philadelphia, all aboard!

91
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,026
Step down Marty, King is back.

92
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:10,518
On the rack in the back.
It's your goodbye chariot.

93
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:15,439
Make hams of you and scram!

94
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,320
Two thousand miles is a long trip.

95
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,873
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

96
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,238
Pillow, sir?

97
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:35,135
Driver! If you'll be good enough
to move those newspapers, I'll have a seat.

98
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,646
Hey, wait a minute!

99
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,520
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,781
The papers. What's the idea of
throwing them out?

101
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:57,985
The papers? It's a long story, my friend.

102
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:00,568
I never did like the idea
of sitting on newspapers.

103
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:04,363
I did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.

104
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,708
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

105
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:11,627
They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.

106
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:15,215
A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.

107
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:22,095
Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but I do.

108
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,599
I always wear it out in the open so...

109
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:27,356
...if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.

110
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:29,607
Yeah?

111
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,688
Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

112
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,401
Our conversation could have been over
long ago.

113
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,695
Yeah?

114
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:41,448
If you keep that up,
we won't get anywhere.

115
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,241
Yeah?

116
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,990
You got me. Yeah!

117
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:59,798
Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.

118
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,717
I beg your pardon?

119
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:05,381
Now listen,
I put up a stiff fight for that seat.

120
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,432
So, if it's just the same to you, scram.

121
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:12,020
Driver, are these seats reserved?

122
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:15,643
- No. First come, first serve.
- Thank you.

123
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,232
These seats accommodate two people,
don't they?

124
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,151
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

125
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:22,315
Thank you.

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,657
Move over.

127
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,574
This is a "maybe they do."

128
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:41,839
If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.

129
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,860
Next time you drop in, bring your folks.

130
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,296
Get some! Come on, everybody!

131
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,640
Hot dogs, folks!

132
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:34,393
Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.

133
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:35,857
Red hot coffee!

134
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,395
Right around there.

135
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:40,525
Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!

136
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,649
Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!

137
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:26,939
He got away.

138
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:30,327
I found myself in the middle of brush
and no sign of the skunk.

139
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,784
I don't know what you're raving about,
young man.

140
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:36,573
- Furthermore, I'm not interested.
- Well of all the....

141
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:40,414
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.

142
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,629
My heavens! It's gone!

143
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,294
I knew you'd catch on eventually.

144
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:49,339
- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

145
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:54,057
No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.

146
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:56,267
You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.

147
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,469
No, I can't.

148
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:01,398
- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.

149
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,394
Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.

150
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:06,938
Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.

151
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:09,653
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!

152
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:12,151
That's silly.
The company will take care of it.

153
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:16,373
Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?

154
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,497
I want to be left alone.

155
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,253
Why, you ungrateful brat.

156
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,288
Board!

157
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,171
All aboard!

158
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,519
Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.

159
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:14,655
Only 30 minutes for breakfast.

160
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:18,442
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

161
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:19,913
Read all about it!

162
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,981
I'm so sorry.

163
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,645
Silly, isn't it?

164
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,570
Why, everybody's gone!

165
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:00,409
Thank you for that, very much.

166
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:05,243
- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
- Yes.

167
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,538
That was foolish of me.

168
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:13,043
Why didn't you shove me away?

169
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:17,335
I hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.

170
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,341
How about some breakfast?

171
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:25,435
No thank you. No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.

172
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:29,769
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.

173
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,898
No, they'll wait for me.

174
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:38,486
Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Be sure to wait for me.

175
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:39,779
Yeah?

176
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:41,566
Yes.

177
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,641
Where's the bus to New York?

178
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:07,393
It left about 20 minutes ago.

179
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:11,768
But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

180
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,522
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

181
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:19,148
Good morning. Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

182
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:23,614
Seems to me,
I've already thanked you for that.

183
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:25,156
What time's the next bus?

184
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:26,740
8:00 tonight.

185
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:29,832
8:00? That's 12 hours.

186
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,543
Sorry, miss.

187
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,548
What's wrong?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

188
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:38,088
Why are you so excited?
You missed it, too.

189
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:39,883
Yeah, I missed it too.

190
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,966
Don't tell me you did it on my account.

191
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:48,597
I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is....

192
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:51,719
Young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.

193
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,439
I can take care of myself.

194
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:57,398
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here's your ticket.

195
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,274
My ticket?

196
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:01,397
I found it on the seat.

197
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:08,530
Thank you.
It must have fallen out of my purse.

198
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,667
You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.

199
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,790
- What are you talking about?
- You won't get away with it.

200
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:21,500
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

201
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,342
You must have me confused
with someone else.

202
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,719
Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.

203
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,604
I've always been curious to know...

204
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,818
...what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.

205
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:43,399
Take my advice. Grab the next bus back
to Miami. That guy's a phoney.

206
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:47,030
I didn't ask for your advice.

207
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,867
That's right. You didn't.

208
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,365
You're not going to notify my father,
are you?

209
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,787
What for?

210
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,874
You probably could get
some money out of him.

211
00:16:58,005 --> 00:16:59,333
I never thought of that.

212
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:03,088
If you promise not to do it,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

213
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,009
You won't gain a thing by giving me up.

214
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:07,218
I'm willing to make it worth your while.

215
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,678
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

216
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,677
It's very important to me.

217
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:13,512
I'd pay you now, only...

218
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:16,141
...all I had when I jumped off
the yacht was a watch.

219
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:18,307
I had to pawn it to get these clothes.

220
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,354
I'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.

221
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:22,856
Never mind.

222
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:25,486
I had you pegged right from the jump.

223
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:30,785
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.

224
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:34,992
You're in a jam and all you can think of is
your money. It never fails, does it?

225
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,457
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

226
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,038
No, you wouldn't.

227
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,920
It never occurred to you to say...

228
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:43,841
..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

229
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:46,499
That'd bring you down off your high horse.

230
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,002
I'll tell you something to ease your mind.

231
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:50,675
You don't have to worry about me.

232
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,423
I'm not interested in your money
or your problem.

233
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:57,646
You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.

234
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,194
You send telegrams here?

235
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,609
I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?

236
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,781
"To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.

237
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:19,954
"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.

238
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:23,622
"I know where Ellen Andrews is."
No, do you really?

239
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:26,749
Go on. Send the telegram.

240
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:30,882
"How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of...."

241
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,175
Mush.

242
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,508
"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.

243
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:39,220
"What I said about never writing
another line for you still goes.

244
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:41,306
"Are you burning? Peter Warne."

245
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,226
That'll be $2.60.

246
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:45,440
- Send it collect.
- Collect?

247
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:46,808
Collect.

248
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:57,533
Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...

249
00:18:57,623 --> 00:19:01,917
...Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York....

250
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:31,485
Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.

251
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:33,948
Gets tiresome.
Especially for somebody like you.

252
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:35,780
You look like you've got class.

253
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:40,617
Yes, with a capital "K". I'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.

254
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,293
Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.

255
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,254
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.

256
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:49,675
Shapeley's the name
and that's the way I like them.

257
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:51,629
You made no mistake sitting next to me.

258
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:53,464
Most girls you meet on the bus...

259
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:55,881
...ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.

260
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:58,893
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

261
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:01,386
You can't be too particular, neither.

262
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:03,853
What's the matter, you ain't saying much?

263
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:07,856
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

264
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:13,487
That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance."

265
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:15,990
Well shut my big, nasty mouth.

266
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,990
Looks like you're one up on me.

267
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,166
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

268
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:26,463
...that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.

269
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:28,089
That's what I always say.

270
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:29,966
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:34,131
When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.

272
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:38,423
Now you're just my type.

273
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:41,721
Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.

274
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:47,019
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me.
With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.

275
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:50,521
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

276
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,355
Looks like you're two up on me now.

277
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:56,650
Hey, you.

278
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:01,615
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

279
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:05,248
I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.

280
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:06,831
- Your wife?
- Yes.

281
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:08,786
Come on.

282
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,171
Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, I was just....

283
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,878
Sure. Excuse me, miss.
I was just trying to make things pleasant.

284
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:18,504
Excuse me, I....

285
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,090
I didn't mean anything, Doc.

286
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,347
- No offence, Doc.
- No.

287
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:34,646
If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.

288
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:38,945
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.

289
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,410
What'd you do all day?

290
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:52,127
Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.

291
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:56,919
Your clothes are all wet.

292
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:00,092
Here.

293
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:03,055
You're as helpless as a baby.

294
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:04,257
Thank you.

295
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:09,347
Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

296
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:10,899
Here, boy.

297
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:15,525
- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.

298
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:18,187
- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But....

299
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,904
- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.

300
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:24,079
Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!

301
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:27,874
$1 .60.

302
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:30,626
You had $4 last night.

303
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:33,497
How will you get to New York at this rate?

304
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:36,045
That's none of your business.

305
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,798
You're on a budget from now on.

306
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:42,340
- Just a minute. You can't--
- Shut up.

307
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:07,117
- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.

308
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,532
Looks like we can't get through
till morning.

309
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,992
If any passengers want a place to sleep...

310
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:14,458
...you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

311
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:16,919
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

312
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,414
Dyke's Auto camp.

313
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,794
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

314
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:23,924
Are you talking to me?

315
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:26,630
Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.

316
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:45,487
Hey! Come on, we're all set.

317
00:23:56,714 --> 00:24:00,546
Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.

318
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:12,268
Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?

319
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,327
Darn clever, these Armenians?

320
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:37,329
Yeah, it's a gift.

321
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:44,761
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.

322
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:49,092
Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.
I registered as Mr. and Mrs.

323
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:50,511
You did?

324
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,097
What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?

325
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:58,102
I kind of half expected you to thank me.

326
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:01,819
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

327
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,608
Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?

328
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,529
You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.

329
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,626
Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?

330
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:24,754
Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.

331
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:28,551
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

332
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:30,927
You're just a headline to me.

333
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:32,850
A headline?

334
00:25:33,852 --> 00:25:35,928
You're not a newspaper man, are you?

335
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:38,180
Chalk up one for your side.

336
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:42,518
Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?

337
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:46,401
All right, I'm here to help you.
What I want is your story.

338
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:51,615
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.

339
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,869
I need that story.
Between you and me, I've got to have it.

340
00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:02,206
Isn't that just too cute.

341
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:06,256
There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?

342
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:11,630
You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. Including this.

343
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:14,842
This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.

344
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:19,263
These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...

345
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:23,441
...but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.

346
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:33,445
Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.

347
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:36,235
It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.

348
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,287
But I'm going to follow you.

349
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:39,405
Yeah.

350
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,708
And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.

351
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:48,332
Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.

352
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:51,627
A simple story for simple people.

353
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:55,468
You behave yourself,
I'll see you get to King Westley.

354
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:58,677
If not,
I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.

355
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,890
Now, which of these beds do you prefer?

356
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,059
This one? All right.

357
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:32,549
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

358
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,251
This?

359
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:41,051
I like privacy when I retire.
Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.

360
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:42,769
Prying eyes annoy me.

361
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:49,150
Behold the walls of Jericho.

362
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,403
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.

363
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:54,991
But a lot safer.

364
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:57,862
You see, I have no trumpet.

365
00:27:58,787 --> 00:28:01,408
Now to show you
my heart's in the right place...

366
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:04,071
...I'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.

367
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,411
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

368
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:11,504
You don't want to join the Israelites?

369
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:15,292
All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

370
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,716
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

371
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:21,682
No two men do it alike.

372
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:25,558
I once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

373
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:27,647
Now he made a picture.

374
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:31,273
Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.

375
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,195
I have a method all my own.

376
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:39,487
If you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.

377
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:44,159
Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.

378
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,618
There's where I'm different.

379
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,625
I go for the shoes next.

380
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:51,541
First the right. Then the left.

381
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:57,094
After that, it's every man for himself.

382
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:21,909
Still with me, brat?

383
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,990
Don't be a sucker.

384
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:31,034
A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.

385
00:29:31,212 --> 00:29:33,370
Besides, you got nothing to worry about.

386
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:37,462
The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.

387
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,897
"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
The big bad wolf

388
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,398
"The big bad wolf

389
00:29:57,613 --> 00:30:02,773
"She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la"

390
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:08,243
Would you mind please,
putting out the light?

391
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:09,874
No, not at all.

392
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,161
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

393
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,959
Excuse me.

394
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,315
By the way, what's your name?

395
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:26,069
What's that?

396
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,033
Who are you?

397
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:30,371
Who, me?

398
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,375
I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.

399
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:38,833
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

400
00:31:39,673 --> 00:31:41,712
You've got a name, haven't you?

401
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,916
Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.

402
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,464
Peter Warne.

403
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,216
I don't like it.

404
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:54,436
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

405
00:31:56,689 --> 00:31:58,599
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

406
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:01,646
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

407
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:25,169
- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?

408
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:28,177
It's from Charleston.
"Checking every northbound train.

409
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,795
"Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.

410
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,725
"No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.

411
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,719
"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."

412
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,143
It's just the same as all the others.

413
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:41,566
- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.

414
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:43,976
- What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.

415
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,228
- All right, step on it.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:48,030
I hope she's all right.

417
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:52,155
All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?

418
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,366
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.

419
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,189
Hello?

420
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,061
Hey, mister.

421
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:30,573
Hello.

422
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:32,859
What's the matter, you not up yet?

423
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,650
- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.

424
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,996
It's a toothbrush, thanks.

425
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,241
My dress, you had it pressed.

426
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:45,960
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.

427
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:48,331
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

428
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:51,212
I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then...

429
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:53,011
...I'll drag you out myself.

430
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,347
- One, two, three, four, five....
- I really think you would!

431
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,220
I'm out! I'm out!

432
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:02,897
You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.

433
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:06,264
Outside?

434
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:08,935
All the best homes have them outside.

435
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:14,071
I can't go out like this.

436
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,079
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

437
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:18,870
Here, use mine.

438
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:21,410
Thanks.

439
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:22,704
Make it snappy.

440
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,200
Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.

441
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:28,297
- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

442
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:33,469
Where'd you say the showers were?

443
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:34,834
Here's a towel.

444
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,551
Thank you.

445
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:41,467
You're kind of little, aren't you?

446
00:34:41,728 --> 00:34:42,926
Where's the shower?

447
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:45,690
Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.

448
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:47,642
I'll find it myself.

449
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:22,218
Are the showers in there?

450
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,101
They ain't out here.

451
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,765
Thank you.

452
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:32,101
Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?

453
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:40,943
You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.

454
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,965
Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?

455
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,043
Say, I'm sorry about last night.

456
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:59,718
Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.

457
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:11,225
High time you got back.

458
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:13,890
I met some very interesting women
at the showers.

459
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:17,527
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

460
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:22,402
Come on. Sit down.

461
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:26,865
My, my. Scrambled eggs.

462
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:32,583
Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

463
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:34,167
Any complaints?

464
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:35,715
No. No complaints.

465
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:39,168
I'd have cream for your coffee,
but I'd be buying a whole pint.

466
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:41,177
You don't have to apologise to me.

467
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:43,552
You don't know how much
I appreciate all this.

468
00:36:43,682 --> 00:36:46,553
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

469
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,140
Must be the spring.

470
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:51,514
I thought maybe "believe you me"
told you some more snappy stories.

471
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:55,936
No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.

472
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:59,147
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.

473
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:02,949
- Donut?
- Thanks.

474
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,577
You think this whole business is silly?

475
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:09,075
Running away and all.

476
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,874
No. Makes too good a story.

477
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:14,542
Yes, you do.
You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.

478
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:17,293
Perhaps I am.
Although, I don't see how I can be.

479
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:19,707
Spoiled people are used to
having their way.

480
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,509
I never have. On the contrary.

481
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:25,723
I've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.

482
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,182
Can you believe, this is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man?

483
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:31,426
Yeah.

484
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,680
It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

485
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:35,647
You're doing all right.

486
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:36,890
Thanks.

487
00:37:38,528 --> 00:37:44,780
Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.

488
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:47,275
One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.

489
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:52,658
It has its moments. It's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.

490
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:56,708
I did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.

491
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:59,626
It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.

492
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:02,752
It didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.

493
00:38:02,844 --> 00:38:06,972
I was so mad, I ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car I saw.

494
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:08,462
Guess who was in it?

495
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,886
Santa Claus?

496
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:11,257
Ghandi?

497
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:13,345
King Westley was in it.

498
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,563
- Is that how you met him?
- Yes.

499
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:19,812
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

500
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:23,022
By 6:00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.

501
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:27,951
Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?

502
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:30,527
Now don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.

503
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:32,994
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.

504
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:37,625
Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.

505
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:40,463
You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.

506
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:44,131
It's all a matter of timing.
I'll write a book about it.

507
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,499
Thanks, professor.

508
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:49,337
Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.

509
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:52,641
I'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.

510
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,226
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

511
00:38:56,522 --> 00:39:00,935
You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.

512
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,352
How do I know you're detectives?

513
00:39:03,446 --> 00:39:05,522
Show him your credentials, Mac.

514
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:09,233
Detectives.

515
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,406
That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?

516
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:16,249
Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.

517
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,828
Get yourself all mussed up.

518
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:20,705
Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.

519
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,454
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.

520
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,049
She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.

521
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:29,761
What are you talking about?

522
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:33,425
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

523
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:37,718
She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

524
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:42,229
Come in.

525
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:45,069
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?

526
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:49,198
Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

527
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:51,819
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

528
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,702
Who, me? You wanna see me?

529
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:55,163
What's your name?

530
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:58,700
- Are you addressing me?
- Yeah. What's your name?

531
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:01,835
Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.

532
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:04,703
What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?

533
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:08,132
- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.

534
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:09,297
This isn't a public park.

535
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:11,177
I got news to take a sock at you.

536
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:13,344
- Take it easy.
- The men are detectives.

537
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:15,590
Even if they're the
whole police department...

538
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:17,926
...they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.

539
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,771
Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.

540
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:25,648
Is that so? How many times
have I told you not to butt in?

541
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:28,902
You don't have to lose your temper!

542
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:31,195
As usual. Every time I try to protect you.

543
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:34,367
At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.

544
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:36,741
He did not! I told you a million times.

545
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,582
He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.

546
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,291
He didn't. You were drunk.

547
00:40:41,376 --> 00:40:43,167
Nuts! Just like your old man.

548
00:40:43,253 --> 00:40:45,958
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

549
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:48,170
There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.

550
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,049
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!

551
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:53,213
- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?

552
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,130
Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.

553
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:59,383
We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.

554
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,428
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.

555
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:04,012
Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.

556
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:05,601
Quit bawling!

557
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:09,525
I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.

558
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:25,249
You weren't bad, jumping in like that.

559
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:28,041
- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.

560
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:30,040
We could start a two-people
stock company.

561
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,884
Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.

562
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:35,258
We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."

563
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:37,754
What about "Cinderella" or
a real hot love story?

564
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:39,011
No, too mushy.

565
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,891
I like mushy stuff.

566
00:41:41,644 --> 00:41:43,138
Quit bawling!

567
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:45,599
Bus leaves in five minutes!

568
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:47,973
- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.

569
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:50,819
Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.

570
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:58,190
I'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.

571
00:41:58,286 --> 00:41:59,566
This is the last session....

572
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:01,579
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

573
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:04,119
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

574
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:08,955
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?

575
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,547
"Have I got a story. Stop.
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.

576
00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:15,716
"Hope you're the same."

577
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,972
- Collect?
- Yes.

578
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:21,761
- If you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.

579
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,176
And that gives me an idea for all of you.

580
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,514
I want action, Lovington, action.

581
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:29,523
- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.

582
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:32,395
She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.

583
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:35,197
- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.

584
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:36,609
Send in Clark and Brown.

585
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:39,154
- You sure she isn't with King Westley?
- No.

586
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:42,072
He's being trailed 24 hours a day.

587
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:44,742
He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.

588
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:47,951
I'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.

589
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:49,123
I don't think so.

590
00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:51,287
Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.

591
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,669
Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of...

592
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:56,083
...$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.

593
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,084
Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.

594
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:01,890
Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.

595
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:05,343
Wire this to them.
I want the story to break right away.

596
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,520
Now we'll get some action!

597
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,884
Fine, that's fine.

598
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:50,395
You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?

599
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:52,523
Yeah.

600
00:43:57,779 --> 00:44:01,729
"Once I was happy
but now I'm forlorn

601
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,485
"Like an old coat
that is tattered and torn

602
00:44:06,162 --> 00:44:09,496
"Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn

603
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:13,625
"Betrayed by a maid in her teens

604
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:17,123
"This maid that I loved
she was handsome

605
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:21,673
"And I tried all I knew how to please

606
00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:25,630
"But I never could please her
one-quarter so well

607
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:29,803
"As the man on the flying trapeze

608
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:33,637
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

609
00:44:33,857 --> 00:44:37,605
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

610
00:44:37,777 --> 00:44:41,442
"His actions are graceful,
all the girls he does please

611
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:45,357
"And my love he has stolen away"

612
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,199
I know the second verse there.

613
00:44:56,212 --> 00:45:00,079
"Now he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse

614
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,800
"His eyes would undress
every girl in the house

615
00:45:04,178 --> 00:45:11,675
"Perhaps he is better described as a louse
And still people came just the same

616
00:45:11,894 --> 00:45:15,726
"Now he smiles from the bar
on the people below

617
00:45:15,898 --> 00:45:19,018
"And one night he smiled on my love

618
00:45:19,944 --> 00:45:21,604
"She blew him a kiss

619
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:27,901
"And she hollered bravo
And he hung by his schnozzle from above

620
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:31,576
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

621
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:37,288
"Daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful

622
00:45:37,378 --> 00:45:43,546
"All the girls he does please
And my love he has stolen away"

623
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:48,253
Do you mind if I take the third one?

624
00:45:53,644 --> 00:45:57,262
"I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks

625
00:45:57,439 --> 00:46:01,057
"While she spent her time
with the circus' freaks

626
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:05,108
"The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

627
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:08,359
"Alas, Alack and Alaska

628
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:12,408
"I went to this fellow
the villain, and I said

629
00:46:12,538 --> 00:46:15,989
"I'll see that you get your deserts

630
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:19,665
"His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer

631
00:46:19,962 --> 00:46:23,580
"He sneered once again and said no

632
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:27,250
"He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

633
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:30,470
"That daring young man
on the flying trapeze

634
00:46:31,181 --> 00:46:34,764
"His actions are graceful
The girls he does please

635
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:38,558
"My love he has stolen away"

636
00:46:46,196 --> 00:46:49,232
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.

637
00:46:49,324 --> 00:46:52,775
It's the first comfortable position
I've been in all night.

638
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,071
"She flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

639
00:46:57,165 --> 00:46:58,790
"The daring young--"

640
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,170
What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.

641
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:04,879
Something happened to her.

642
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:06,625
Look how pale she is.

643
00:47:14,975 --> 00:47:17,051
Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.

644
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:19,469
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

645
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:24,102
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

646
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:27,978
What happened to your money?

647
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:32,531
Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.

648
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:35,735
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

649
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:39,490
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

650
00:47:39,582 --> 00:47:42,156
...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.

651
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:50,712
She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.

652
00:47:51,052 --> 00:47:54,717
The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.

653
00:47:55,056 --> 00:47:58,389
I shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.

654
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:01,602
Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.

655
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:03,645
No, but you might need it.

656
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:04,645
Come on.

657
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:05,811
I got millions.

658
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,730
Here.

659
00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:09,018
- Thanks.
- Come on, go back.

660
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:28,253
Better phone for some help.

661
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,375
Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.

662
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:32,671
Yeah?

663
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:36,343
Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?

664
00:48:37,807 --> 00:48:41,507
Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

665
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,927
Take that story there, for instance.

666
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,847
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

667
00:48:47,983 --> 00:48:49,063
No.

668
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,316
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.

669
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,650
Why?

670
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:54,529
Because I don't believe in hogging.

671
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:57,900
A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.

672
00:48:57,993 --> 00:48:59,737
That's what I always say.

673
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,498
What's on your mind?

674
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,955
Five G's or I crab the works.

675
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,087
Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.

676
00:49:16,178 --> 00:49:18,716
I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.

677
00:49:23,185 --> 00:49:25,937
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man I need.

678
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:29,307
- You made no mistake, believe me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

679
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,982
- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?

680
00:49:33,445 --> 00:49:34,275
Huh?

681
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:36,772
A gat. A rod.

682
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,317
- Got any fireworks on you?
- No.

683
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:44,622
I got a couple of machine guns
in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.

684
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:47,826
May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.

685
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,369
If you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.

686
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:53,752
I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.

687
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:54,873
Killer?

688
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:57,713
Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.

689
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:00,336
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

690
00:50:00,472 --> 00:50:04,220
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

691
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:07,061
$10, 000? Chicken feed.

692
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:10,978
Now listen, we're holding that dame
for a million smackers.

693
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:14,898
Say, I didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, I've got....

694
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,686
What's the matter? You getting yellow?

695
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:21,232
I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids.
I can't afford to get....

696
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:23,735
Pipe down your mug before I....

697
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:27,081
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

698
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:30,368
Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?

699
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,002
You know too much.

700
00:50:32,087 --> 00:50:33,996
I won't say anything, honest I won't.

701
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:37,089
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

702
00:50:37,342 --> 00:50:41,422
- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

703
00:50:41,513 --> 00:50:42,508
Yeah?

704
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:46,099
What's your name?

705
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:47,768
Oscar Shapeley.

706
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:50,433
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

707
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:52,557
Got a couple of kids?

708
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:56,101
Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.

709
00:50:56,194 --> 00:50:58,863
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

710
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,904
You wouldn't. You're not thinking of--

711
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,528
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure.

712
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:06,400
- If you don't....
- I'll keep my trap shut. I will.

713
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,453
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

714
00:51:08,956 --> 00:51:10,367
Bugs Dooley? No.

715
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:13,993
He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.

716
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:15,670
Got a little too talkative.

717
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:17,546
- You know what happened to his kid?
- No.

718
00:51:17,632 --> 00:51:21,166
I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.

719
00:51:21,552 --> 00:51:23,046
That's terrible.

720
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:26,722
He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. I never talk.

721
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:29,258
I never say a word. Word of honour.

722
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:32,050
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

723
00:51:32,146 --> 00:51:34,471
Okay. Just remember that.

724
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:36,729
Now beat it.

725
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:40,981
Sure, mister. Thanks.
I always knew you guys were--

726
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:43,943
Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.

727
00:51:44,075 --> 00:51:46,281
Sure. Anything you say.

728
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,697
- You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
- If you don't beat it....

729
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:51,033
I'm going.

730
00:52:05,971 --> 00:52:08,094
What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?

731
00:52:08,182 --> 00:52:10,091
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

732
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:11,768
Why?

733
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:21,478
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.

734
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:25,781
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

735
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,859
Why did we have to leave the bus?

736
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,654
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

737
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,664
I've been doing a little thinking myself.

738
00:52:37,502 --> 00:52:40,373
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

739
00:52:40,464 --> 00:52:42,456
What's the matter, are you weakening?

740
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:47,425
No. I was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.

741
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:49,802
Did you give that child all your money?

742
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,559
I gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.

743
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:54,931
All the money I had was that ten spot.

744
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:57,932
So I've been thinking
you better wire your father.

745
00:52:58,231 --> 00:53:02,525
No, sir. I started out for New York
and I'm going to get there...

746
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:05,018
...if I have to starve all the way.

747
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,193
Okay.

748
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,817
What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?

749
00:53:10,994 --> 00:53:12,453
Here, take these.

750
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:15,867
- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?

751
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:17,582
Get up on the log.

752
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:30,218
I wish you'd stop being playful.

753
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:35,341
So sorry. You know, this is the first time
in years I've ridden piggyback.

754
00:53:35,935 --> 00:53:37,311
This isn't piggyback.

755
00:53:37,395 --> 00:53:39,553
- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.

756
00:53:40,398 --> 00:53:44,099
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

757
00:53:44,193 --> 00:53:46,151
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

758
00:53:46,237 --> 00:53:49,238
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

759
00:53:49,657 --> 00:53:53,737
My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.

760
00:53:53,828 --> 00:53:56,663
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

761
00:53:56,748 --> 00:53:59,618
I never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.

762
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,370
You're prejudiced.

763
00:54:03,379 --> 00:54:06,049
Show me a good piggy backer.
I'll show you a real human.

764
00:54:06,132 --> 00:54:09,335
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.

765
00:54:09,427 --> 00:54:12,962
Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?

766
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,214
My father was a great piggy backer.

767
00:54:18,644 --> 00:54:20,388
Here, hold this a minute.

768
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:25,650
Thank you.

769
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:34,114
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

770
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:50,125
This looks like the best spot.

771
00:54:50,593 --> 00:54:53,166
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

772
00:54:53,345 --> 00:54:56,880
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.

773
00:54:57,016 --> 00:54:58,095
Peter?

774
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:59,513
What?

775
00:55:00,144 --> 00:55:01,935
I'm awfully hungry.

776
00:55:02,187 --> 00:55:03,682
It's just your imagination.

777
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:05,273
No it isn't.

778
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:08,395
I'm hungry and scared.

779
00:55:08,736 --> 00:55:11,405
You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.

780
00:55:11,488 --> 00:55:12,864
Well, I am.

781
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:15,320
If you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.

782
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:17,781
Not if you're more hungry than scared.

783
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:20,912
All right, you win. Let's forget about it.

784
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:25,825
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

785
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:30,245
Holy smoke!
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

786
00:55:31,383 --> 00:55:34,135
If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.

787
00:55:34,636 --> 00:55:36,344
What about your story?

788
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,181
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

789
00:55:42,603 --> 00:55:45,603
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

790
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:49,603
All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.

791
00:55:50,652 --> 00:55:52,894
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

792
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:54,565
- Then take them off.
- What?

793
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:58,903
All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.

794
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:32,269
You're becoming awfully
disagreeable lately.

795
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:35,938
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

796
00:56:38,908 --> 00:56:42,242
If being with me is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.

797
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:46,412
You can leave any time you see fit.

798
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,665
Nobody's holding you here.

799
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:52,919
I can get along.

800
00:56:58,636 --> 00:56:59,917
Peter?

801
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:03,797
Peter!

802
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:14,731
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

803
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:18,603
What's got into you? I left for a minute
to find you something to eat.

804
00:57:18,698 --> 00:57:19,860
I know but....

805
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:22,030
Here, eat your head off.

806
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:23,618
I don't want it now.

807
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:26,276
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but--

808
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:27,694
But what?

809
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,363
I was so scared, it scared the hunger--

810
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:33,828
Holy jumping catfish.
You drive a guy crazy.

811
00:58:17,006 --> 00:58:19,129
It's liable to get chilly before morning.

812
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:20,919
Better use this.

813
00:58:57,212 --> 00:58:58,754
What are you thinking about?

814
00:59:00,715 --> 00:59:03,385
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

815
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:06,712
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
00:59:08,098 --> 00:59:11,431
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

817
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,085
What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?

818
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:49,419
Hitchhiking.

819
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:55,473
You've given me a very good example
of the hiking.

820
00:59:55,812 --> 00:59:57,888
Where does the hitching come in?

821
00:59:57,981 --> 01:00:00,472
It's a little early yet. No cars out.

822
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:04,811
If it's the same to you...

823
01:00:05,947 --> 01:00:09,150
...I'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.

824
01:00:20,002 --> 01:00:21,378
You got a toothpick?

825
01:00:21,629 --> 01:00:24,202
- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.

826
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,875
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here, I got a penknife, though.

827
01:00:28,386 --> 01:00:29,465
Now hold still.

828
01:00:29,554 --> 01:00:32,091
- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?

829
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,307
All right, now hold still.

830
01:00:36,727 --> 01:00:38,601
Here. Get it?

831
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:40,558
Thanks.

832
01:00:40,982 --> 01:00:44,600
You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?

833
01:00:44,694 --> 01:00:46,437
You needn't rub it in.

834
01:00:50,616 --> 01:00:53,072
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

835
01:00:53,202 --> 01:00:55,527
- Raw?
- Want one?

836
01:00:55,746 --> 01:00:59,993
No. Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

837
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:04,247
That's right, I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

838
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:07,708
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

839
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,421
Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

840
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:12,587
I hate the horrid things.

841
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:18,258
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.

842
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:20,801
And suppose nobody stops for us?

843
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:24,479
They'll stop all right. It's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.

844
01:01:24,566 --> 01:01:26,226
And you're an expert I suppose.

845
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,192
Expert. And I'll write a book
about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

846
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,151
There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?

847
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:35,277
- You think it's simple?
- No.

848
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:38,578
Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?

849
01:01:38,872 --> 01:01:41,909
Some people do it like this. Or like this.

850
01:01:43,418 --> 01:01:45,162
All wrong. Never get anywhere.

851
01:01:45,254 --> 01:01:46,333
The poor things.

852
01:01:46,421 --> 01:01:50,170
But that old thumb never fails.
It's all a matter of how you do it, though.

853
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,756
Now you take No. 1, for instance.

854
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,588
That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.

855
01:01:56,682 --> 01:01:59,351
You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.

856
01:01:59,434 --> 01:02:02,684
- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.

857
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:05,096
Smile goes with this one, like this.

858
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:09,853
That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.

859
01:02:11,405 --> 01:02:13,563
You figured that out all by yourself?

860
01:02:13,824 --> 01:02:17,358
That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.

861
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:20,121
When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.

862
01:02:20,205 --> 01:02:24,072
It's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.

863
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:26,703
That's amazing.

864
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,253
But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.

865
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,668
Here comes a car.

866
01:02:31,758 --> 01:02:34,331
Okay. Now watch me.
I'm gonna use No. 1.

867
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:37,631
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.

868
01:02:43,061 --> 01:02:45,469
I still got my eye on the thumb.

869
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,601
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try No. 2.

870
01:02:49,234 --> 01:02:51,985
When you get to 100, wake me up.

871
01:03:31,734 --> 01:03:34,569
I don't think I'll write that book after all.

872
01:03:34,904 --> 01:03:37,146
Think of all the fun you had, though.

873
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:40,740
You mind if I try?

874
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:42,567
You?

875
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:45,661
Don't make me laugh.

876
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:50,659
You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

877
01:03:51,253 --> 01:03:54,124
I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.

878
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,251
What are you gonna do?

879
01:03:56,675 --> 01:03:58,585
It's a system all my own.

880
01:04:19,198 --> 01:04:21,903
Aren't you going to give me a little credit?

881
01:04:22,117 --> 01:04:23,446
What for?

882
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:28,612
I proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.

883
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:32,826
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

884
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,375
I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.

885
01:04:36,131 --> 01:04:39,749
So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.

886
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:45,176
But if I was young, that's the way
I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.

887
01:04:45,432 --> 01:04:49,726
Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway

888
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:53,809
"Of love on a honeymoon

889
01:04:53,982 --> 01:04:56,817
"Hitchhiking down the highway, down"

890
01:05:08,747 --> 01:05:11,072
Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

891
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,284
Tonsil? Me? No.

892
01:05:14,252 --> 01:05:18,879
Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"

893
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:22,547
All right, let it go.

894
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:24,006
"Turn"

895
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:34,885
How about a bite to eat?

896
01:05:35,023 --> 01:05:37,596
- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.

897
01:05:37,692 --> 01:05:39,851
Young people in love are never hungry.

898
01:05:39,945 --> 01:05:40,775
No.

899
01:05:40,862 --> 01:05:43,649
"Young people in love

900
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,690
"Are very seldom hungry

901
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:53,285
"People in love are very seldom hungry"

902
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,334
What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?

903
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,709
Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.

904
01:06:01,132 --> 01:06:02,626
Eat a carrot.

905
01:06:03,384 --> 01:06:04,416
No.

906
01:06:05,637 --> 01:06:07,131
I'm going in to ask him.

907
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:09,298
You do and I'll break your neck.

908
01:06:21,361 --> 01:06:24,065
Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.

909
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:51,843
I'm sorry....

910
01:06:52,266 --> 01:06:53,844
That's all right.

911
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:07,860
Hey! Come here!

912
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:11,149
You've got my suitcase!

913
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:35,265
What happened to you? I was worried.

914
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,639
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

915
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,644
Well, what happened?

916
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:43,395
A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.

917
01:07:43,484 --> 01:07:44,894
How'd you get the car?

918
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:48,152
I gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.

919
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,345
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

920
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:24,932
Gotta start promoting some.

921
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:29,777
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

922
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:32,653
That'll be good for ten gallons.

923
01:09:07,984 --> 01:09:11,270
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

924
01:09:11,362 --> 01:09:14,032
I don't like you. Never have. Never will.

925
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,032
Now that's clear enough, isn't it?

926
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:18,786
You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.

927
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,697
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

928
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:23,321
Ellie and I got married
because we love each other.

929
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:27,290
She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.

930
01:09:27,378 --> 01:09:32,585
I see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?

931
01:09:33,593 --> 01:09:38,171
All right, you win.
I'll just have to get used to you.

932
01:09:38,598 --> 01:09:42,430
I admit, I'm licked.
But it's only because I'm worried.

933
01:09:43,352 --> 01:09:46,935
If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.

934
01:09:47,023 --> 01:09:50,937
I could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. I've been watched so closely--

935
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:56,234
I know. Well, you can help now.
I've got a room full of reporters in there.

936
01:09:56,782 --> 01:09:58,905
Now, I want you to make a statement.

937
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:02,908
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.

938
01:10:02,997 --> 01:10:06,662
And that if she returns
I won't interfere with your marriage.

939
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,050
- All right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

940
01:10:20,139 --> 01:10:21,253
Okay.

941
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:24,185
I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.

942
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:26,759
So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.

943
01:10:26,854 --> 01:10:28,229
Goodnight.

944
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:32,433
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

945
01:10:32,526 --> 01:10:35,278
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.

946
01:10:35,446 --> 01:10:36,726
What about the money?

947
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:40,072
I talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.

948
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,910
- I must think something up before morning.
- That's swell.

949
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:47,787
Yeah? I'm glad you think so.
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

950
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:53,043
I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.

951
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:59,665
I thought you were in a hurry to get back.

952
01:11:04,725 --> 01:11:08,224
Whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?

953
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:10,971
Everybody will be asleep.

954
01:11:16,486 --> 01:11:19,273
Okay. Cottage no. 6.

955
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:49,719
There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did I tell you--

956
01:11:49,811 --> 01:11:53,262
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

957
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:01,439
We're on the last lap.

958
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:08,830
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.

959
01:12:08,913 --> 01:12:10,111
Yeah.

960
01:12:12,459 --> 01:12:14,250
You'll have a great story, won't you?

961
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:17,202
Yeah. Swell.

962
01:12:39,694 --> 01:12:40,939
Thanks.

963
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:18,429
We certainly outsmarted your father.

964
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:22,018
I guess you ought to be happy.

965
01:13:22,862 --> 01:13:25,068
Am I going to see you in New York?

966
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,654
Nope.

967
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:32,233
Why not?

968
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:36,956
I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.

969
01:13:38,711 --> 01:13:41,249
There's no harm in your coming to see us.

970
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,257
Not interested.

971
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,928
Won't I ever see you again?

972
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:52,965
What for? I've served my purpose!

973
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,800
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

974
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:35,256
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

975
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:38,014
Me?

976
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:40,434
Yes.

977
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:44,978
Haven't you ever thought about it at all?

978
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:51,319
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

979
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:56,285
Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?

980
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:02,865
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.

981
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,040
Where are you gonna find her?

982
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,538
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

983
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:10,798
They don't come that way anymore.

984
01:15:15,723 --> 01:15:17,716
Have I ever thought about it?

985
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:22,513
I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

986
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:32,986
I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.

987
01:15:36,577 --> 01:15:38,237
That's where I'd like to take her.

988
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,912
She'd have to be the sort of a girl...

989
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:46,708
...who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

990
01:15:52,802 --> 01:15:57,760
Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.

991
01:15:58,849 --> 01:16:02,135
You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.

992
01:16:04,563 --> 01:16:07,055
That's the only place to live.

993
01:16:08,192 --> 01:16:13,020
The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.

994
01:16:18,911 --> 01:16:20,904
I've been thinking about it.

995
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,074
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.

996
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:36,541
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

997
01:16:36,637 --> 01:16:39,389
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

998
01:16:40,766 --> 01:16:42,925
You better go back to your bed.

999
01:16:43,894 --> 01:16:47,263
I love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.

1000
01:16:47,356 --> 01:16:51,104
Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter...

1001
01:16:51,819 --> 01:16:54,488
...I can't let you out of my life now.

1002
01:16:55,614 --> 01:16:58,152
I couldn't live without you.

1003
01:17:11,839 --> 01:17:13,997
You'd better go back to your bed.

1004
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:24,802
I'm sorry.

1005
01:18:03,682 --> 01:18:06,386
Did you mean that? Would you really go?

1006
01:18:46,516 --> 01:18:49,552
All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.

1007
01:18:49,685 --> 01:18:51,228
That bag's worth $25.

1008
01:18:52,188 --> 01:18:54,145
I got a bag. I got one for Christmas--

1009
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:56,805
Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning...

1010
01:18:56,901 --> 01:18:59,059
...and buy it back from you
with a $10 profit.

1011
01:18:59,153 --> 01:19:01,442
- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat.

1012
01:19:01,781 --> 01:19:03,738
- What?
- I ain't got a hat.

1013
01:19:04,283 --> 01:19:06,953
Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.

1014
01:19:14,418 --> 01:19:18,001
Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.

1015
01:19:18,089 --> 01:19:21,873
Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.

1016
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:23,165
Sure, boss.

1017
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,044
Hello, Agnes.

1018
01:19:27,139 --> 01:19:30,555
- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.

1019
01:19:30,643 --> 01:19:33,560
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe.

1020
01:19:33,646 --> 01:19:34,641
Don't "Joe" me.

1021
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:36,189
All right, Joe. Listen.

1022
01:19:36,273 --> 01:19:37,732
You know I've always liked you.

1023
01:19:37,817 --> 01:19:40,355
Anytime I could help you,
ran across a good story...

1024
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:43,445
...I came running to you with it.
I got one now.

1025
01:19:43,697 --> 01:19:46,105
The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.

1026
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,943
- It's yours.
- About the Andrews kid?

1027
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:51,493
I've got it all written up, ready to go.
All I want is a $1,000.

1028
01:19:51,622 --> 01:19:53,282
A $1,000? Get out of here before--

1029
01:19:53,374 --> 01:19:55,450
Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.

1030
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:58,080
I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.
I'm in a jam.

1031
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,830
What's the $1,000 for?

1032
01:19:59,922 --> 01:20:01,546
To tear down the walls of Jericho.

1033
01:20:01,632 --> 01:20:03,423
Never mind. If I told you that...

1034
01:20:03,509 --> 01:20:05,585
...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?

1035
01:20:05,677 --> 01:20:07,670
- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

1036
01:20:07,763 --> 01:20:09,672
Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?

1037
01:20:09,765 --> 01:20:12,600
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1038
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:17,931
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.

1039
01:20:19,525 --> 01:20:21,268
- You?
- Yes.

1040
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,610
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.

1041
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:27,234
For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.

1042
01:20:27,324 --> 01:20:30,029
We know each other.
You ought to know when I'm serious.

1043
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:32,823
This is on the level.
I met her on a bus from Miami.

1044
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:35,534
I've been with her every minute.
I'm in love with her.

1045
01:20:35,624 --> 01:20:38,245
You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.

1046
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:40,458
She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.

1047
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:43,582
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know I'm gone.

1048
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:47,084
A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?

1049
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:51,549
What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews--

1050
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,134
That's it.

1051
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,761
Let me see that a minute.

1052
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:00,554
Zeke!

1053
01:21:04,152 --> 01:21:07,153
I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.

1054
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:08,187
Who?

1055
01:21:08,365 --> 01:21:12,113
The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.

1056
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:15,487
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia.

1057
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:18,367
Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1058
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,708
There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.

1059
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:37,386
See that? They're gone.

1060
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:40,685
Looks like it, don't it? What's this?

1061
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:44,264
Ma! Here's the woman.

1062
01:21:44,776 --> 01:21:47,148
- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?

1063
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:50,323
- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.

1064
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:55,450
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.

1065
01:21:57,497 --> 01:21:59,240
You got any money?

1066
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:01,582
- No.
- Then you'll have to git!

1067
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,459
Yeah. You'll have to git.

1068
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,133
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1069
01:22:09,217 --> 01:22:11,293
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.

1070
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:15,763
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1071
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:22,018
And listen, next time you better not come
back here. I run a respectable place.

1072
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:29,192
- Thanks, you saved my life.
- Okay. So long kid and good luck.

1073
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:33,358
Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.

1074
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:36,991
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaper man in the business.

1075
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,741
Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.

1076
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:41,653
Hold up the morning edition.

1077
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:44,418
Break down the front page.
We'll have a new layout.

1078
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:48,285
Send in a couple of rewrite men.
And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.

1079
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:52,627
I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.

1080
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:57,131
Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1081
01:22:57,223 --> 01:23:01,801
And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.

1082
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,559
Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church...

1083
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:07,601
...with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.

1084
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:09,897
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.

1085
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,686
Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?

1086
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,400
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1087
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,277
I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.

1088
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,409
He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.

1089
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,956
Yes, she's been travelling by bus.

1090
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:31,046
When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1091
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:34,880
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.

1092
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:38,088
Agnes, get me a doctor,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1093
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,671
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare.

1094
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:44,431
Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1095
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,307
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched.

1096
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:48,227
You want us?

1097
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,481
Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.

1098
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,522
She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.

1099
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,186
She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!

1100
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:01,066
Play it up big! Major league!
"Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.

1101
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:02,240
Okay.

1102
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,347
Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.

1103
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:34,480
Can't you drive any faster?

1104
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:43,443
"Young people in love are never hungry"

1105
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:55,713
Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.

1106
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:09,809
Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.

1107
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:16,853
All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.

1108
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:18,736
Come on, step back.

1109
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:23,023
How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?

1110
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:26,118
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1111
01:25:35,045 --> 01:25:40,253
"He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

1112
01:25:40,384 --> 01:25:44,713
"The daring young man
on the flying trapeze"

1113
01:25:58,402 --> 01:26:00,062
Get that thing out of the way!

1114
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:04,068
Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.

1115
01:26:26,638 --> 01:26:28,430
Hey, you darn fool!

1116
01:27:34,289 --> 01:27:38,037
Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.

1117
01:27:47,302 --> 01:27:48,926
Gordon's out back some place.

1118
01:27:49,053 --> 01:27:52,837
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1119
01:27:56,436 --> 01:27:59,353
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in.

1120
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:00,849
- What?
- He left this money.

1121
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:03,229
- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?

1122
01:28:03,317 --> 01:28:05,310
- There he goes.
- Hey, Pete!

1123
01:28:08,531 --> 01:28:13,323
Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1124
01:28:13,411 --> 01:28:16,281
Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.

1125
01:28:16,372 --> 01:28:19,326
- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
- No, great.

1126
01:28:19,417 --> 01:28:22,702
But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn...

1127
01:28:22,795 --> 01:28:27,587
...and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.

1128
01:28:28,384 --> 01:28:31,005
Yeah. Where am I?

1129
01:28:36,559 --> 01:28:39,476
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1130
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:41,719
Thanks.

1131
01:29:07,006 --> 01:29:08,204
Ellie?

1132
01:29:08,757 --> 01:29:10,086
Hello, Dad.

1133
01:29:10,175 --> 01:29:11,835
I knocked several times.

1134
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:15,514
I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.

1135
01:29:15,597 --> 01:29:19,677
Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.

1136
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:22,469
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1137
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,060
Stunt?

1138
01:29:24,148 --> 01:29:26,354
Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.

1139
01:29:29,903 --> 01:29:31,279
Yes, I heard.

1140
01:29:31,363 --> 01:29:33,356
Personally, I think it's silly, too.

1141
01:29:34,616 --> 01:29:36,490
You look lovely, child.

1142
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:38,569
Are you pleased with the gown?

1143
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:40,867
Ellie?

1144
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:46,210
The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1145
01:29:52,426 --> 01:29:54,134
What's the matter, child?

1146
01:29:57,264 --> 01:29:58,592
What's wrong?

1147
01:29:58,682 --> 01:29:59,880
Nothing.

1148
01:30:00,559 --> 01:30:03,132
You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?

1149
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:04,349
No.

1150
01:30:04,563 --> 01:30:08,892
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1151
01:30:09,067 --> 01:30:12,353
Well, you gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1152
01:30:12,529 --> 01:30:15,364
You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.

1153
01:30:15,907 --> 01:30:20,450
I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.

1154
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,364
What's the matter, child?

1155
01:30:23,665 --> 01:30:25,076
Aren't you happy?

1156
01:30:28,253 --> 01:30:29,996
I thought so.

1157
01:30:30,505 --> 01:30:33,292
I knew there was something on your mind.

1158
01:30:35,301 --> 01:30:37,093
There, now.

1159
01:30:39,305 --> 01:30:40,883
What's the matter?

1160
01:30:42,559 --> 01:30:45,725
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1161
01:30:47,647 --> 01:30:48,975
Have you?

1162
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:55,397
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1163
01:30:56,573 --> 01:30:58,695
This must be serious.

1164
01:31:00,034 --> 01:31:01,659
Where'd you meet him?

1165
01:31:03,705 --> 01:31:05,163
On the road.

1166
01:31:05,415 --> 01:31:08,332
Now don't tell me you've fallen in love
with a bus driver?

1167
01:31:08,459 --> 01:31:09,740
Oh, no.

1168
01:31:14,465 --> 01:31:15,663
Who is he?

1169
01:31:17,051 --> 01:31:19,293
I don't know very much about him.

1170
01:31:20,221 --> 01:31:22,178
Except that I love him.

1171
01:31:22,431 --> 01:31:25,682
If it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to--

1172
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:29,179
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1173
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:30,512
Come now.

1174
01:31:30,606 --> 01:31:33,691
Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.

1175
01:31:33,859 --> 01:31:39,862
He says that I'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.

1176
01:31:40,241 --> 01:31:41,652
Ridiculous.

1177
01:31:42,118 --> 01:31:44,609
He doesn't think so much of you, either.

1178
01:31:44,745 --> 01:31:45,741
Well, I--

1179
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:48,747
And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1180
01:31:48,999 --> 01:31:51,573
He says you raised me stupidly.

1181
01:31:52,086 --> 01:31:55,003
And now that's a fine man
to fall in love with.

1182
01:31:55,548 --> 01:31:57,208
He's marvellous.

1183
01:31:57,466 --> 01:32:00,633
What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?

1184
01:32:01,762 --> 01:32:04,680
- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.

1185
01:32:04,849 --> 01:32:08,977
It wouldn't do any good.
I practically threw myself at him.

1186
01:32:09,728 --> 01:32:13,596
Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?

1187
01:32:14,984 --> 01:32:16,561
No, I'll go through with it.

1188
01:32:16,652 --> 01:32:19,606
But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.

1189
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:22,947
No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.

1190
01:32:23,075 --> 01:32:25,317
I've done it all my life.

1191
01:32:25,411 --> 01:32:28,910
I've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.

1192
01:32:29,873 --> 01:32:35,081
I'm tired, father. I'm tired
of running around in circles.

1193
01:32:36,088 --> 01:32:39,587
He's right, that's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.

1194
01:32:40,425 --> 01:32:42,169
I've got to settle down.

1195
01:32:43,178 --> 01:32:46,263
It doesn't matter how,
where, or with whom.

1196
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:50,643
You've changed, Ellie.

1197
01:32:51,353 --> 01:32:55,979
I can't walk out on King now.
It would make us all look so ridiculous.

1198
01:32:56,817 --> 01:33:00,186
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1199
01:33:01,321 --> 01:33:03,361
I'll never see Peter again.

1200
01:33:03,615 --> 01:33:05,323
Is that his name?

1201
01:33:07,202 --> 01:33:08,661
Peter Warne.

1202
01:33:09,871 --> 01:33:11,579
Peter Warne.

1203
01:33:14,459 --> 01:33:15,918
Why, do you know him?

1204
01:33:16,044 --> 01:33:17,669
Why, no.

1205
01:33:17,963 --> 01:33:20,536
Father, you haven't heard from him,
have you?

1206
01:33:20,674 --> 01:33:23,793
- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?

1207
01:33:36,648 --> 01:33:40,598
I guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?

1208
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:43,819
- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.

1209
01:33:43,905 --> 01:33:46,906
- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.

1210
01:33:48,076 --> 01:33:52,026
Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1211
01:33:52,413 --> 01:33:56,660
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

1212
01:33:57,001 --> 01:33:59,706
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1213
01:33:59,837 --> 01:34:01,960
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1214
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:03,833
Fine, have him come in.

1215
01:34:10,598 --> 01:34:12,140
I'll be going.

1216
01:34:23,444 --> 01:34:26,813
If it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.

1217
01:34:26,906 --> 01:34:28,317
How are you, Ellie?

1218
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:30,072
You happy?

1219
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:32,697
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?

1220
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:35,155
Here we are, let's drink.

1221
01:34:35,248 --> 01:34:38,581
It's up to you now.
I want our life to be full of excitement.

1222
01:34:38,668 --> 01:34:41,953
We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.

1223
01:34:42,088 --> 01:34:44,579
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1224
01:34:45,174 --> 01:34:49,468
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.

1225
01:35:05,986 --> 01:35:08,275
Yeah. Who?

1226
01:35:10,991 --> 01:35:12,569
Why can't I see you at your office?

1227
01:35:12,868 --> 01:35:16,284
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1228
01:35:16,372 --> 01:35:19,538
I thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.

1229
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:23,208
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1230
01:35:23,295 --> 01:35:25,965
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1231
01:35:26,048 --> 01:35:29,333
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1232
01:35:29,468 --> 01:35:31,959
No. Why do I wanna--

1233
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:39,469
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

1234
01:35:39,853 --> 01:35:42,973
I'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.

1235
01:35:43,065 --> 01:35:45,686
I wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.

1236
01:35:45,776 --> 01:35:48,018
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1237
01:35:50,948 --> 01:35:51,647
Mr. Warne?

1238
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,903
Yeah.

1239
01:35:55,702 --> 01:35:58,027
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1240
01:35:58,413 --> 01:36:02,328
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything...

1241
01:36:02,417 --> 01:36:04,410
...about you. About your helping her.

1242
01:36:04,503 --> 01:36:07,622
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1243
01:36:07,756 --> 01:36:10,247
Why did she think
I lugged her from Miami?

1244
01:36:10,467 --> 01:36:13,136
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1245
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:17,467
She does? Isn't that sweet of her?
You don't, I suppose.

1246
01:36:17,599 --> 01:36:22,060
Well, I don't know. I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.

1247
01:36:22,145 --> 01:36:24,019
I presume you feel justified.

1248
01:36:24,105 --> 01:36:27,557
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemised.

1249
01:36:30,237 --> 01:36:35,231
"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.

1250
01:36:35,325 --> 01:36:38,077
"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.

1251
01:36:38,161 --> 01:36:43,997
"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.

1252
01:36:44,501 --> 01:36:47,585
"All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline."

1253
01:36:47,754 --> 01:36:50,755
And I sold some shorts and socks, too.
I'm throwing those in.

1254
01:36:50,882 --> 01:36:54,167
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

1255
01:36:54,469 --> 01:36:57,090
Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000,
maybe more.

1256
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:02,387
Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?

1257
01:37:02,811 --> 01:37:04,388
What 10,000?

1258
01:37:04,854 --> 01:37:06,265
The reward.

1259
01:37:07,023 --> 01:37:09,431
Who said anything about a reward?

1260
01:37:09,609 --> 01:37:12,361
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.
I assumed--

1261
01:37:12,445 --> 01:37:16,941
All I want is $39.60. If you give
me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.

1262
01:37:17,116 --> 01:37:18,824
It gives me the jitters.

1263
01:37:19,661 --> 01:37:22,827
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1264
01:37:22,914 --> 01:37:25,665
The average man would go
after the reward.

1265
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,122
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1266
01:37:28,211 --> 01:37:31,247
It's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.

1267
01:37:31,339 --> 01:37:35,206
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like paying for the privilege.

1268
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:37,210
Were you taken for a buggy ride?

1269
01:37:37,386 --> 01:37:41,218
Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do I get it?

1270
01:37:41,891 --> 01:37:43,765
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

1271
01:37:58,282 --> 01:37:59,776
Here you are.

1272
01:38:00,117 --> 01:38:01,315
Thank you.

1273
01:38:02,661 --> 01:38:05,746
Do you mind if I ask you a question,
frankly?

1274
01:38:06,123 --> 01:38:08,080
Do you love my daughter?

1275
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,461
Any guy in love with your daughter
should be examined.

1276
01:38:12,546 --> 01:38:13,922
Now that's an evasion.

1277
01:38:14,048 --> 01:38:18,211
She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.

1278
01:38:18,552 --> 01:38:22,420
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1279
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:25,551
If you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.

1280
01:38:25,643 --> 01:38:26,841
Do you love her?

1281
01:38:26,935 --> 01:38:30,020
A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.

1282
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:31,481
She's my idea of nothing.

1283
01:38:31,565 --> 01:38:33,890
I asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?

1284
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:38,148
Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
I'm a little screwy myself!

1285
01:38:40,407 --> 01:38:43,278
Here's to the merry-go-round.

1286
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:52,198
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1287
01:38:57,674 --> 01:39:00,379
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1288
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:03,001
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1289
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:06,681
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1290
01:39:06,767 --> 01:39:09,139
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

1291
01:39:15,525 --> 01:39:18,313
- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.

1292
01:39:18,403 --> 01:39:19,732
Now just a minute, Ellie.

1293
01:39:19,821 --> 01:39:22,443
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

1294
01:39:35,211 --> 01:39:37,963
Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.

1295
01:40:32,018 --> 01:40:34,307
Here they come, boys. Turn them over.

1296
01:41:02,965 --> 01:41:05,171
You're a sucker to go through with this.

1297
01:41:06,594 --> 01:41:08,670
That guy, Warne, is okay.

1298
01:41:09,013 --> 01:41:13,307
He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.

1299
01:41:13,392 --> 01:41:16,843
It's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.

1300
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:18,895
You took him for a ride.

1301
01:41:26,155 --> 01:41:29,156
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1302
01:41:31,702 --> 01:41:34,703
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1303
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:37,411
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1304
01:41:41,337 --> 01:41:43,744
And you can make an old man happy.

1305
01:41:43,839 --> 01:41:46,508
And you won't do so bad for yourself.

1306
01:41:46,925 --> 01:41:50,045
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1307
01:42:01,315 --> 01:42:04,648
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

1308
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:08,519
...and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman...

1309
01:42:08,613 --> 01:42:13,026
...in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully...

1310
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:18,325
...be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.

1311
01:42:21,126 --> 01:42:26,002
King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?

1312
01:42:26,506 --> 01:42:27,502
I will.

1313
01:42:28,717 --> 01:42:32,299
Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1314
01:42:32,387 --> 01:42:34,676
...so long as you both shall live?

1315
01:42:38,393 --> 01:42:39,424
Ellen!

1316
01:42:40,979 --> 01:42:42,177
Ellie!

1317
01:43:12,385 --> 01:43:13,500
What happened?

1318
01:43:13,636 --> 01:43:15,712
I haven't the slightest idea.

1319
01:43:30,486 --> 01:43:34,614
Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.

1320
01:43:34,699 --> 01:43:36,276
Don't want to see anybody.

1321
01:43:36,367 --> 01:43:38,194
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1322
01:43:41,622 --> 01:43:47,874
Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.

1323
01:43:48,379 --> 01:43:52,958
That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.

1324
01:43:53,342 --> 01:43:56,961
That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.

1325
01:43:57,221 --> 01:44:01,550
I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.

1326
01:44:02,685 --> 01:44:05,010
Don't fall out of any windows!

1327
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:09,642
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1328
01:44:10,192 --> 01:44:13,811
"What's holding up the annulment,
you slowpoke.

1329
01:44:14,155 --> 01:44:17,274
"The walls of Jericho are toppling."

1330
01:44:18,868 --> 01:44:23,494
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let them topple."

1331
01:44:26,625 --> 01:44:28,665
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1332
01:44:28,836 --> 01:44:31,125
If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.

1333
01:44:31,213 --> 01:44:33,704
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1334
01:44:34,216 --> 01:44:37,834
They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.

1335
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:39,345
What do you reckon that's for?

1336
01:44:39,763 --> 01:44:42,005
Blamed if I know.
I just brought them a trumpet.

1337
01:44:42,099 --> 01:44:43,178
A trumpet?

1338
01:44:43,267 --> 01:44:45,722
A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.

1339
01:44:45,811 --> 01:44:48,183
What in the world do they want
a trumpet for?

1340
01:44:48,272 --> 01:44:49,434
Don't know.

Belt, black.One black suit jacket.One pair black suit pants.One hat. Black.One pair of sunglasses.$23.07.Sign here.What's this?What?This car.This stupid car.Where's the Cadillac?The Caddy. Where's the Caddy?The what?The Cadillac we used to have.The Bluesmobile.I traded it.You traded the Bluesmobile for this?No, for a microphone.A microphone?Okay, I can see that.What the hell is this?This was a bargain.I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.It's an old Mount Prospect police car.
They were practically giving them away.Well, thank you, pal.The day I get out of prison,my own brother picks me up in a police car.You don't like it?No, I don't like it.Car's got a lot of pickup.It's got a cop motor,
a 440 cubic-inch plant.It's got cop tires,
cop suspension, cop shocks.It was a model made before catalytic converters
so it'll run good on regular gas.What do you say?Is it the new Bluesmobile,
or what?Fix the cigarette lighter.What are we doing here?You promised you'd visit the
Penguin the day you got out.Yeah. So, I lied to her.You can't lie to a nun.We gotta go in and visit the Penguin.No fucking way.Who is it?Jake and Elwood.Come in.Hello, boys.Nice to see you.Please, have a seat.No, boys.
Come over here in front of me.I want to see your faces.The county took a tax assessment
of this property last month.They want $5,000.Doesn't the Church have to pay that?They would, if they were
interested in keeping the place.But they aren't.The Archbishop wants to
sell this building outrightto the Board of Education.What's gonna happen to you?I'll be sent to the missions: Africa,Latin America,Korea...
- Forget it.$5,000? No problem.We'll have it for you in the morning.
Let's go.No. I will not take your filthy, stolen money!Well, then.I guess you're really up shit creek.I beg your pardon.
What did you say?I offered to help you.You refused to take our money.Then I said, "I guess you're
really up shit creek. "Ow! Christ, Jake,
take it easy, man.Elwood!Jesus Christ!Shit! Goddamn it!Son of a bitch!Jesus Christ.
You son of a bitch!You fat penguin!Fuck this noise, man!You are such a disappointing pair.I prayed so hard for you.It saddens and hurts methat the two young men whom I raisedto believe in the Ten Commandments,have returned to me as two thieveswith filthy mouths and bad attitudes.Get out!
And don't come backuntil you've redeemed yourselves.Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.Jake, Elwood.Curtis!
- Hey, man!You look fine, man!Good to see you, man!Hey, buy you boys a drink?Boys, things are bad.They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Educationand I'll be out on the street.That money's got to be in the Cook
County Assessor's Office within 11 days.They wouldn't turn you out, would they?Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.You're the only one
that was ever good to ussinging Elmore James tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.Well, the sister was right.You boys could use a little churching up.Slide on down to the Triple Rock
and catch Rev. Cleophus.You boys listen to what he's got to say.Curtis,I don't want to listen
to no jive-ass preachertalking to me about heaven and hell.Jake, you get wise.
You get to church.All I'm saying is we got to figure out
some way to get that money honestly.That could be a problem.It's like the Penguin says.We've got to make that
move towards redemption.We got to go to church.We've got to make that move towards redemption.We got to go to church.Bullshit.Come on.And now,
this week's sermonis from our beloved,
the Rev. Cleophus James!James.Come on, Reverend!
- Come on, preacher.And now, people.Take your time!And now, people.When I woke up this morningI heard a disturbing sound.Yeah.I said, when I woke up this morningI heard a disturbing sound!What I heard was the jingle-jangleof a thousand lost souls!I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and womendeparted from this life!Wait a minute!Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth,seeking the divine lightthey'll not find,
because it's too late!Too late! Yeah!
Too late for them to ever see againthe light they once chose
not to follow. All right!Don't be lost when your time comes!"For the day of the Lord cometh"as a thief in the night.

They all took straight jobs.Yeah? So you know where they are.You said you were keeping
in touch with them.I got a couple of leads,

visited or even wrote you, huh?They're not the kind of
guys who write letters.You were outside.
I was inside.You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.I kept asking you if we
were gonna play again.What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?I took the liberty of bullshitting you.
Okay?You lied to me.It wasn't lies.
It was just bullshit.What?Rollers.
No.Yeah.What? What did I do?You failed to stop at a red signal.The light was yellow, sir.May I see your license, please?God damn it!Man, I haven't been pulled
over in six months.I bet those cops have got SCMODS.SCMODS?State County Municipal Offender Data System.Elwood, we show your license

don't you go changing.So, Jake, you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?You got the money you owe us, motherfucker?Look, let's just get something straight here...The reason he got locked in
the slam in the first placewas for sticking up a gas
station to cover you guys.You're kidding.He pulled that job to pay for
the band's room-service tabfrom that Kiwanis gig in Coal City.You did?
That's right.So I don't want to hear anymore
of this small-change shit.We're putting the band back together.Now, who here at this tablecan honestly say
that they played any fineror felt any better than they did than
when they were with the Blues Brothers?You were the backbone.The nerve center of a great
rhythm-and-blues band.You can make that live,
breathe and jump again."Murph and the Magic Tones?"Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.And I thought I had it bad in Joliet.At least we got a change
in clothes, sucker.You're wearing the same shit
you had on three years ago.Jake ain't lying.We had a band powerful enough to
turn goat piss into gasoline.We'll never get that fat sound again.
- Not without some more horns.We'll never get Mr. Fabulous.Where is he?
Forget it.Mr. Fabulous is the top
maitre d' at the Chez Paul.He's pulling down six bills a week.Matt Murphy got married.Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy?He opened a soul food restaurant
with his old lady on Maxwell Street.And he took Blue Lou with him.You'll never get Matt and Mr. Fabulous
out of them high-paying gigs.Oh, yeah?Well, me and the Lord,
we got an understanding.We're on a mission from God.Mainly French cuisine.No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer dines here.He's dead, sir.Private dining rooms are available.Oh, no. I thought it was
supposed to be 5 years.Didn't you get 5 years?
Uh, no, sir, not you.And your name, sir?Rizzolo, for 8 at 11:30.
Thank you.Mr. Fabulous, how marvelous
it is to see you.You're looking younger than ever.Wait.

to move to another table,away from those two gentlemen.Why? Have they been disturbing you?
- No.It's just that, well, frankly,
they're offensive... smelling.I mean, they smell bad.Excuse me, sir. I'll see if I can
locate another table for you.Thank you.Wrong glass, sir.How much for the little girl?The women?

We need you and Blue Lou.Oh, man. Don't talk that way around here.My old lady,

- Of course.1060 West Addison.Let's go.Anybody with that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.I want all party members in the tri-state
district to monitor the city, county,and state police on their C.B's.Mr. Blues is gonna fuck up.And when he does,he better pray the police
get to him before we do.All right, man.We've been in this car
for three hours now.Where the hell is this place?I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.What's the name of the place?Uh, the name of the place is, uh,Bob's Country Bunker.Here we are.Bob's Country Bunker?Jake,
the sign says,"Tonight only, the Good Ole Boys. "Blues Brothers!It should read,
"Tonight only,"the Blues Brothers' triumphant return. "Must be some kind of mistake.You guys unload the stuff.Elwood, come with me.What can I get you boys?You thirsty, you hungry
or just driving through?Maybe you'd like a beer,
or something a little harder?We happen to make the
state's best pepper steak.No, thank you, ma'am!We may be sucking back a few
beers a little later on.We'll be here all night.

you boys will be playing tonight.Man, I don't think we know any
of the songs on this list.This list doesn't mean anything.
They're just requests.Do our regular set.

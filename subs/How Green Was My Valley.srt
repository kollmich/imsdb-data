Come and wash now.

160
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,498
May... May we
speak first, sir?

161
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,375
Yes.

162
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,627
They did not give the
real reason for this cut.

163
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,087
We've been expecting it

164
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,506
since the ironworks
at Dowlais closed.

165
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,300
What have the ironworks
to do with us?

166
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,720
Their men came to the colliery
willing to work for any wage,

167
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,388
so our wages
must come down.

168
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,140
And this is only
the beginning.

169
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,727
Watch now, they'll cut us
again and still again,

170
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,854
until they have this,

171
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,939
as empty
as their promises.

172
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,150
Nonsense. A good worker
is worth good wages,

173
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,027
and he will get them.
Not while
there are three men

174
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,111
for every job.

175
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,072
Why should owners pay
more if men are willing
to work for less?

176
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,366
Because the owners
are not savages.

177
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,701
They are men,
like us.

178
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,912
Men, yes,
but not like us.

179
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,122
Would they deal with you
when you went to them?

180
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,291
No.

181
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,293
They have power,
and we have none.

182
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,504
How will we get power,
from the air?

183
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,131
No. From a union
of all the men.

184
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,674
Union, is it?

185
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,137
I never thought
I'd hear my own sons
talking socialist nonsense.

186
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,764
But it's sense,
good sense!

187

Unless
we stand together...

188
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:02,933
I've had enough
of this talk!

189

Your good mother
will be waiting.

192

Do you think I'll let them
make my father stand
like a dog in the rain

193
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,720
and not raise
my hands to stop it?

194

Hisht, Davy.

195
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,350
Who gave you
permission to speak?

196
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,310
This is too important
for silence.

197
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,436
They're trying
to punish you...

198
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,356
It is not more important
than good manners.

199
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,985
What are we
going to do?

200
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,279
You'll die of the cold
when it comes to snow.

201
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,990
Let us stand together
and see how they act then.

202
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:04,911
Right. The men will come
if we say the word.
All the pits are ready.

203
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,707
You will not make me
a plank for your politics.

204
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,792
I will not be
the excuse
for any strike.

205
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,545
If they can do
things like that
to the spokesman,

206
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,963
what will they try
and do to the men?

207
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,883
We will see.
Be silent now.
Finish your supper.

Enough now!

But...
On with your work.

I'm not sorry.

We are not questioning
your authority, sir,

but if manners prevent
our speaking the truth,

What does it mean,
Mr. Gruffydd?

236
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,734
It means that

237
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:29,866
something has gone
out of this valley
that may never be replaced.

Home to your

They'll need you today.

22 weeks the men
were out, as the strike
moved into winter.

240
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,565
It was strange to go
out into the street

241
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,401
and find the men there
in the daytime.

242
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,571
It had a feeling
of fright in it,

243
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,908
and always the mood of
the men grew uglier,

244
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,285
as empty bellies
and desperation

because you're talking
against my husband!

You're a lot of cowards
to go against him!

can sit in the same chapel
with him I cannot tell.

To say he's with the owners

He's had no beating.

I broke the rule
when I fought.

There's no rule
for that.

of a stick, Mr. Jonas?

By its length, of course.

And how would you
measure a man

909

on a boy 1/3 his size?

Now, look,
to make a good boxer,

919
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:25,241
you must have a good
right hand, you see?

920
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,205
Now, you see,
that is how you

No. No, Huw.

have only proved

one among you

the courage to come to me

his voice here now

which you have shown

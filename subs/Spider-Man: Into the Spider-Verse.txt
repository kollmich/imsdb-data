guys can go around?- [BARKS]
- All right. Thanks, New York.PETER 2:
<i>What was that?</i><i>Kid electrocuted me</i><i>with his hands.</i>[GASPS, SIGHS]- You're like me.
- I got some questions.[GRUNTING]Why do you look like
Peter Parker?[PETER 2 GRUNTING]Because I am Peter Parker.Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?Why are you older?
And why is your bodya different shape?Pretty sure
you just called me fat.You don't look
so hot either, kid.Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.- Are you a ghost?
- No.- Are you a zombie?
- Stop it.- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.Are you from another dimension?
Like a parallel universewhere things are like
this universe but different?And you're Spider-Man
in that universe?But somehow traveled
to this universe,but you don't know how?Wow. That was really
just a guess?We learned about it
in physics.- Quantum theory.
- This is amazing!You can teach me
like Peter said he would.Before he died.- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah, right.Look, I made a promise
to him.Here's lesson number one,
kid.Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.[GASPS][YELPS]Peter, seriously...[SIGHS]
Trust me, kid.This'll all make you
a better Spider-Man.- [GRUNTS]
- [ELECTRONIC STATIC]Hey, are you okay?PETER 2:
No, I'm not.What's going on
with your body?I don't think my atoms
are real jazzedabout being
in the wrong dimension.[GROANS]Look, I'm not looking
for a side gigas a Spider-Man coach.I got a lot going on
in my dimension."With great power

finish that sentence.Don't do it!
I'm sick of it.[ELECTRONIC STATIC][GROANS]Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.I don't have a choice!Kingpin's got
a supercollider.He's tryin' to kill me.- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.- Goodbye.
- Where you going?When it runs again,
I'll jump in- and get back to my life.
- You can't let them run it.I'm supposed to destroy itso it never runs again
or everyone's gonna die."Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.But there's always a little bit
of time before everybody diesand that's when I do
my best work.Aren't you gonna need this?Aw, you have a goober.
Give it.Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.I can never remember,so I always call it
a goober. Give it.I need it
to destroy the collider.I need it to go home.I'll swallow it.
Don't play with me.- What?
- I said...The collider created a portal
that brought me here.And I have to get...- Did you break this?
- No, it broke.I don't remember
what happened.See, this is why
I never had kids.Can't we make another one?<i>We</i> can't do anything.
Thanks to you,I have to re-steal what
your guy stole from Alchemax- and make another one of these.
- [GRUNTS]If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave,everyone in this city,my parents, my uncle and
millions of others, will die.And you're just gonna
go homeand leave me here
to figure this out for myself?- You good with that, Spider-Man?
- Yeah.[SIGHS]What are you doing?Making you feel guilty.
Is it working?How could it...? No.
Look at me.Does it look like
it's working?- No. No, it's not...
- [SIGHS, CHUCKLES][MUFFLES A YELL]No! No! No!
Do not let him win!All right, kid. You win.Come on, we don't have
a second to lose.Mmm. I love this burger.
So delicious.One of the best burgers
I've ever had.In my universe, this place
closed six years ago.I don't know why.
I really don't.Mmm.You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.- Can we focus?
- Mm-hm. Sure.- The other Peter...
- You gonna eat that?I'm listening.The other Peter said
he was gonna be- showing me the ropes.
- Wow.MILES: You got any Spider-Man
tips you can tell me now?Yeah, I got plenty.Disinfect the mask.You're gonna wanna use
baby powder in the suit,heavy on the joints.You don't want
any chafing, right?- Anything else?
- Nope, that was everything.I think you're gonna be
a bad teacher.Uh-uh-uh?
Look up where Alchemax is."A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."[GASPS]
You can teach meto swing on the way there.- [IMITATES WEB THROW]

It's disrespectful.- Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.
- [GROANS]MILES: So how do we
retrace Peter's steps?That's a good question.What would I do
if I were me?Got it.<i>Step One:
I infiltrate the lab.</i><i>Two: Find the head scientist's
computer.</i>MILES: <i>That lady with the
bike is the head scientist.</i><i>I saw her

reexamine my personal biases.</i><i>Step Four:
I hack the computer.</i>It's not technically

my train of thought.<i>Step Five:

"You've got 24 hours."You've got 24 hours.What this means is there

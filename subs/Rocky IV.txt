I didn't know.I hope you like it.The guy I bought it from says.even if it looks like a snake, don't worry.It won't bite you.It's beautiful.You know what's amazing?After all these years.everything still seems kind of new.You remember a long time ago I told you thatyou ain't never getting rid of me.remember that?You're not.You're never getting rid of me.Happy almost anniversary.Can you answer a few questions?How long you here for?We talk later, please.When are you fighting, Drago?We talk it later.Is it definite the Soviet Unionwill enter professional boxing?Please, no more talk now.We will talk at press conference.Do you know where it will be held?We talk it later.Today may have proved to be a landmark in sports history.After unraveling years of red tape,Russia will now throw its hat into the ring.The prize ring, that is.The introductions were made by his wife Ludmilla Vobet Drago.She was the double gold medalist in swimming.Today the Soviet Union has officially entered professional boxing.My husband and great undefeated heavyweight world amateur championCaptain Ivan Drago.has come with his trainers to Americato compete as an international sportsman and ambassador of goodwill.Has Drago ever boxed against a real professional?From having been trained in Russia by great boxing coach, Manuel Vegaand now by Sergei Rimsky, we hope he's qualified to do so.Hope?Well, I know he is, but I don't want to sound too confident.If possible, we would like tohave an exhibition bout with your famous champion Rocky Balboa.What makes you think he can fight someone as seasoned as Balboa?No one can match his strength, his enduranceor his aggressiveness.You sound like he's indestructible.Yes, he is.Well. Can this mammoth Russian,already nicknamed the Siberian Express,wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks?Whoever he fights first,it'll be one hot ticket.We'll be right back with a check on today's pro football scoreboard.Dad, when can I learn to fight?I can't hear you. What?I want to learn to fight.Could you turn your robot down?You see I fight,so you don't have to fight.I want you to use your head for somethinginstead of a punching bag like I do.Your head doesn't look like a punching bag.That's nice. Thanks a lot.It looks like a catcher's mitt.A wise guy.Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed's on the phone.Yeah? I'll be right there.You can get it right here.I hope it's not another rematch.Don't worry about it.Hello? Yeah, Apollo.Turn that down. How are you doing?Yeah? You're coming out?That's great. What am I doing?I'm just getting dizzy.My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarters today.As you can see, it is highly advancedand we wish to show the American press a small portionof the advances our country's madein the technology of human performance.Coach Rimsky, what does all this do to enhance performance?Well...If I may answer.It makes a man a better mana great athlete a super athlete by harnessing all his strength.Though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry,we wish to educate your country.There have been rumors of dopingand distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.Has Drago partaken in any such experiments?No, Ivan in naturally trained.Then how do you explain his freakish strength?Like your Popeye, he ate his spinach every day.Shall we have a demonstration?Please do.Thank you.A normal heavyweightaverages 700 pounds of pressure per square inch.Drago averages 1850 pounds.So the result is quite obvious.What results are those?Whatever he hits, he destroys.He's big and he's strong, but he's clumsy.I know I can beat him.Why do you want to fight again?It's something I believe in.You can do your homework.Okay. Later, Dad.Later, Uncle Paulie, Apollo.Later, big man.See you later, kiddo.Don't you think people are expecting to see Rocky whack this bum out first?Yeah, and he will when it's for real.This is just an exhibition bout. It's kid stuff.What's the purpose?What's worth getting hurt for?What the hell is that?That's my girl.Thanks, honey.You're welcome.Nice song.It's my favorite. You're the greatest.See you, sport.See you.Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?She loves me.Like I was saying,I don't want this chump to come here with all that hypetrying to make us look bad.They try every other way.With Rock's help, we can get great media coverage,We can make them look badI think it's wrong.It's never been more right.You're a great fighter,but you've been retired for five years.Don't you think it's time to think about something else?How much can you take?Either of you.I'll get the coffee.I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.I just care about you both.You ever try these comics?No.Keeps your fertility.Paulie.This was a great fight.Great? I'm getting punchy just watching.What you using for a chin there, Stallion?I should have slipped that one.Yeah, You definitely should have slipped.It's crazy how people care about you when you're in that ring bleeding,but once you step out of that ring, you're ancient history.You ain't ancient history.Nobody's asking for autographs.Apollo, Can I ask you something?What?You know this fight you're having against the Russian.Do you think maybe it ain't against him?If it's not him, then who is it against?Do you think maybe it's like you against you?No, I think you really are getting brain damaged.That's what I think.Yeah, maybe, butI'm speaking the truth, Apollo.Are you? Yeah.I don't think I want to hear this.Come on, Apollo.you're a great fighter. No doubt about that.But we have to face the facts too.You don't want to believe it, but maybe the show is over.That's easy for you to say. You're still on top.What happens when you're not on top? Then what?Where do we go? We sure can't be born again.I know we can't be born again, but we have to change sometime.I don't want to change! I like who I am!I like who you are too, but look at that.You don't want to believe this, but that ain't us no more.We can't do that the way we did before.We're changing. We're turning into regular people.No, maybe you think you're changing.but you can't change what you really are.Forget all this money and stuff around you. It don't change a thing.You and me don't even have a choice.We're born with a killer instinct,you can't turn off and on like a radio.We have to be in the middle of the action because we're warriors.Without some challenge, without some war to fightthen the warrior may as well be dead.So I'm asking you,as a friend,stand by my side this one last time.You're a great talker, Apollo.All right, but when this is over.You know me, Stallion.I always think of something else.That's what I'm afraid of.All right, you have a deal.I feel sorry for that guy.Apollo, what made you decide to put on an exhibition with Drago?Call it a sense of responsibility.Responsibility, how?I have to teach this young fellow how to box American style.Isn't Drago a little inexperienced to be in the same ring?Some folks have to learn the hard way.No knockout prediction?I'm not angry with him.I just want to show the worldRussia doesn't have all the best athletes.How do you think Apollo should fight Drago?Personally, the first thing you need is a ladder.How does it feel to spar with the great former champion?The man's tongue didn't come through customs.My husband is very happy to have this opportunity.It's his dream.Dream. How do you mean?In our country, Apollo Creed is well-known and very respected.It could be a good victory.Wait a minute. Win?You don't really think you're going to whip me, do you?He didn't come here to lose.You hold on, little lady.Lose and lose royally he will do.How can you be so sure?I've been with best, I've beaten the best.I've retired more men than Social Security.Excuse, please.You are not very realistic.Where did you come from?What are you talking about?You can box, yes,but you are far too old to think you can win over Drago.Is that a fact?Yes, and it could be a painful one.You put that heavy bag without balls in the ring with meand you'll see the meaning of pain!Why do you insult us?You just hold on here.Don't make me out as the bad guy.I came to talk about a friendly exhibition bout till you started up.come right the big mouth bodyYou are the aggressor! This is obvious!I wish to say to the press in all fairness,Drago should not even fight this man,He is a has-been!You get that big chump in the ring right now!Bring it on. I don't want to hear her.Just let that chump go.All rightI said what I feel.We'll finish this in the ring.You understand? Whatever you like.You and all your puppets just shut up!You are history, chump.How did I do?A little loud for my taste.But good? Yeah, very good.Welcome one and all to the city of lightsLas Vegas,and one of the most unusual events in yearsEast meets West.Age versus youth in a goodwill exhibition matchas the former champion Apollo Creedtakes on a mountain of muscle from the Soviet UnionIvan Drago.Come on.Patience is a virtue.I'm ready to rock and roll.I understand, but you need your equipment. There you go.Now you look like a mummy.I feel like a mummy.Does it feel okay?It feels great. I could eat nails.I never tried them things.What?I never had snails.I seen them in the garden, but I never wanted to eat them.I didn't say anything about snails. I said, "nails,"Nail. Stallion. YeahYou look pretty goodbut do me a favor when you go up thereTry not to wear yourself outYeah, wear myself outIt's just that you haven't been in the ring for five yearsI just want you to maintain a bitYou sound like I'm an old manI'm in the best shape of my life.

YeahCome on, we don't really know anything about this guy you're fightingLet's say I postpone.I pull out, somebody else steps in and whips this chumpWhere does that leave me?

It's a matter of sizeand evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen?Drago is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.This other man has not the size or the enduranceor the genetics to win.It's physically impossible for this little man to win.Drago is a look at the future.There's been no mention yet, but how much are you making for this fight?No money.It's not about money.Has the fight date been set yet?December 25Why Christmas?That's what I was told.Where?It's in Russia.Are you nuts?What's going on?Why did you agree to this?We fight in Soviet Union or we fight nowhere.Why don't you ask Drago's wife why she is afraid?Tell them, please.I'm afraid for my husband's life.We have threats of violence everywhere.We are not in politics.All I want is for my husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.You call him a killer.He's a professional fighter, not a killer.You have this belief that you are better than us.You have this belief that this country is so very goodand we are so very bad.You have this belief that you are so fairand we are so cruel.It's all lies and false propaganda.to support this antagonistic and violent government!"Violent"?We don't keep our people behind a wall with machine guns.Who are you? Who am I?I'm the unsilent majority, big mouth!Good!Yes, insult us!It's more typical rude behavior toward visiting foreignersBut perhaps this simple defeat of this little so-called championwill be a perfect exampleof how pathetic and weak your society has become!We go!Mrs. Balboa!How do you feel about going to Russia?How does it feel to be part of such a controversial decision?Did Creed's death make up your husband's mind?I don't know what you're talking about!why will fight in Christmas?Is it his decision?When will you go to Russia?I'm not going to Russia.

All right, listen up.Everybody off the phone.Tobin Frost has
just waltzed his wayinto a U.S. Consulate
in Cape Town, South Africa.Now this man,
without question,is one of the most
notorious traders
that we've got.Errington, call up
his background profile.ERRINGTON:
Tobin Frost was recruited
into the Agency in 1 984.He tested
off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work.His first assignment
was in Lebanon,
in January, 1 985.Three months later,
he captured and flippeda high-ranking
Hezbollah leader.Over the next
severaI years,Frost successfuIIy
questioned and recruited
many high-vaIue individuaIs.He became known as
an expert manipulator
of human assets,and he literally rewrote
Agency interrogation
protocols.LINKLATER: Frost served
in many active theaters,including Libya
from 1 995 to 1 998,Jordan, 1 998 to 2000.During his tenure
in Jordan,Frost was suspected
of leaking information
to Mossad,but nothing
was confirmed.Ten years ago,
Frost went off
the reservation completely.He currentIy
has no allegiancesand is wanted
for espionage
on four continents.His last known sighting
is Hamburg, Germany, in 201 1 .You know, Harlan,
we should interrogate
Frost now.Sweat him for
everything he's got.Once he's stateside,
we have fewer options.I have
an interrogator in Yemen,
can be there in eight hours.I already have
a team in Jo'burg
that can be there in two.We'll take Frost
to the safe house,
interrogate him there.My people
are fully capable
of handling this.This is Tobin Frost.We'll go with Jo'burg.Okay.(BALL BOUNCING)You must turn around.Help. Help.(PHONE RINGING)Accident.(SPEAKING FRENCH)(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)Housekeeping.LANDLORD ON PHONE: We have

Matthew James Weston.Born 02-24-82 to
Terry and Madeline westonin Port washington,
New York.An assault arrest,
one month afterboth parents and
a younger sisterwere killed in
a traffic accidentin which his
father's blood-alcoholwas twice
the legal limit.Yale, degree in Economics,
recruited out of Yale law.High marks in analytics
and linguistics at The Farm.Excellent in
tradecraft skills.His girlfriend, Ana Moreau,
is a French national.He reported them
as having "close and
continuing contact."She's a second year resident
in the oncology department
at Groote Schuur.WESTON: Get in that car.FEMALE ANALYST:
She accepted a position
with HÃ´tel-Dieu Hospitalin Paris,
starts in two weeks.No known political
affiliations. She's clean.I want you to post a car
outside their apartment.Use back channels.And get NSA to cross-check
their telephone records
and their e-mails, please.Yes, ma'am.FROST: You know, it would
be easier if I knew
where we were going.You just drive, all right?
Just drive, middle lane.All right.Hey, what are you doing?
Middle lane.Just drive around.FROST: All right.
I'm driving.(SNIFFLES)Nice to know who
you're talking to.
What's your name?You crushed my windpipe.Well, you locked me

You're here
under your real name.What is it?Weston, Matt.All right.How long you been
a safe house keeper?Twelve months.Happy birthday.(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)Cape Town,
that's low-level detail.You should have been
out of here by now.Maybe I requested
the assignment.(FROST CHUCKLES)Or maybe Langley
doesn't trust you
with anything else.So, what's your plan?Oh, let me guess.
Follow protocol.Protocol states that
if your house is crashed,you do an SDR
to make sure
no one's following you.Activate your GPS
in your Go-Bag,
select another safe house.You think I'm going to
let you just take me in?I think you need
to shut up.(FROST CHUCKLES)I think you need to consider
how your house was attacked
in the first place.Have you done that, Matt?They followed Kiefer.
They followed him
from the consulate,and that's how they
found the safe house.Come on, you don't
really believe that,
do you?How did they know l was
near the consulate
in the first place?Hmm.But l like this, you know.
You and me, figuring shit out.Like the Hardy Boys.
(LAUGHS)That house was
a secure location.Whoever crashed itdidn't stop by a gas station
and ask for directions to
the nearest safe house.They were invited.
Someone told them,
Matthew.Think about it.
Someone you know.So you better ask yourself,
can you trust your landlord?Go ahead,
you're not going
to get in my head.I already am
in your head.They're going to
isolate you, Matt.They're going to
be real nice
to you at first.They're going to put
their arm around you
and tell you things like,"You did a decent job, son.
We'll take it from here."That's when you know
you're screwed.Forget about me.
They're going to
focus on you.They're going to try
and make a connection
between you and I.So that if this
all goes wrong,they'll have something
to fall back onin their little
Senate hearings.I'm not your
only enemy tonight.WHITFORD:
So, it's someone in-house.It's the only way
this thing could've
happened.We were
completely buttoned up.I want a list of everyone
who knew about this.Backgrounds, affiliations,particularly any
connections with Frost.Every movement right
up until this operation.Your extraction team,

it would be bestif we didn't go home
as a precaution,and I agree with him.I know there's
nothing to worry about,
but I agree with him.I think you should
just go to Dena's

It was a girl, wasn't it?Maybe it was a guy,
I don't know.I don't judge.You can't expect to
have a real relationship
in our line of work, Matthew.Don't worry.
She's not going
to leave you.See, what happens is,
you try to
protect her with lies,and then it starts
to add up.At the safe house
you said that they'd
kill me to get to you.After a while,
even the truth. . .Why?
. . .starts to sound
like a lie.You have something. You got
something that they want.
What is it?Is she a local?Don't worry about her.
What is it?Oh, it is a girl.You'll keep
covering your tracks,
she'll keep believing.Because she wants to,
because she needs to.That's why we exist,
you and me,
that's our job.To take advantage of that.People's desire
to believe.To trust.She's not going to
leave you, Matthew.You're going
to leave her.I'm not you.MALE ANALYST:

it's an active location.So, approach
with caution.Matt?Do you know how
they found Frost?Do you know who

fitting Frost's descriptionin the car at the time

That they were
working together?They ran joint operations
in Hamburg in the mid-'80s.Frost's last sighting
was in Hamburg, 201 1 .And what are the Brits
saying about Wade?Officially,
they're saying nothing.Unofficially?He's been the subject
of a five-month
internal investigation.They think he's
been trading intel.Hmm.So what the hell
did Wade leak to Frostthat was so important
it was worth killing six

he was organizing

an air traffic controller.
He was just a guy.I put a bullet
in his skull.Black Ops came in,
they replaced him
with one of their own,and crashed a Gulfstream
in the ocean that night.The thing was,
the family that
was on the plane. . .The husband,
he was a whistleblower.The whole thing was aboutstopping him

I need to get up.Stay.Hey. . .That's exactly
as it happened.Obviously,
this situation needsto be handled with
a certain amount
of finesse.Has anybody else
seen this report?No, sir. Not yet.Matt, I'm sure this
comes as no surprise,but parts of this report are
going to have to be altered
for national security.Which parts, sir?Well. . .David Barlow can't
be held responsiblefor what happened
to the safe house.We just don't
need the scandal.But, sir,
you and I both know that,
that is just not the truth.People don't want
the truth anymore, Matt.It's too messy.
Keeps them up nights.I'll tell you what I am
willing to do, though.I think the Agency
has grossly
underestimated you,and I'm recommending you
for a senior case officer
position.Provided you still want it.That's a generous
offer, sir.There's just
one thing you need
to clarify for me.Of course.Frost may have been
carrying some vital intel.A file.I'm not seeing that
anywhere in this report.What was
on the file, sir?Something that,
quite frankly,
could be very damagingto the Agency
and to our allies.I don't see why Frost
would even mention
something like that to me.No, I suppose he wouldn't,
would he?You realize, though,
that if that file did leak,what would happen
to the person responsible?That person would
be arrested, sir.He'd be risking
everything.He'd have enemies
in every intelligence
agency in the world.In the eyes of the CIA,
he'd be just like
Tobin Frost.Frost didn't say anything
about a file, sir.All right, son.Take a few days off.We'll get you
started next week.Thank you.And think about
our conversation,
would you?Will do.I'll take it
from here, sir.JOHN C. KING ON TV:

Lilienthal, I believe, who's developeda glider that can take

to apply that to this business,- it would be revolutionary.

- (LAUGHING)- For my birthday!
- Your what?- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.Okay, I do have a present...but not just any present. Oh, no.The most amazing birthday present ever.This extraordinary machine
was originally createdby Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago.But the blueprints had been
lost for centuriesuntil just last week, on a stormy night,when a sunken pirate ship washed upon the shores of Nantucket.They found skeletons and treasuresand the blueprints were recoveredby none other than J.W. Mercantile.The blueprints crossed my desk
very brieflybut I managed to commit them to memory.And if I have remembered correctly...Happy birthday, Caroline.This is a wishing machine.You tell it your wishes...and it keeps them safe
until they come true.Even if you forget them,
they're always there.Can I tell a wish?Step right up. Go ahead.I wish to marry Santa Claus.(CHUCKLES) That is a good wish.I wish...for ballet slippers.Hey, that's... that's a good wish, too.What's your wish, Mommy?I wish...for happiness like this foreverfor you and you...and for your father.Boring!- (PHINEAS LAUGHS)

- Huh?This bank only wants to lend moneyto people with money.What are you looking at, flop-doodle?Mr. Barnum.This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.It's a good bet is what it is, sir.People don't want to admit it...but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.It's why we stare at it.The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.Of course. I, uh...
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.The deed and title
to my entire flotilla of trading vessels.CHARITY:
Why would a bank loan us $10,000?Because we put up collateral.But, dear, we don't have any collateral.Sure we do. In the South China Seas.CHARITY:
In the South China Seas?Deep in the South China Seas. (LAUGHS)CHARITY:
And what did we buy with this loan?"Barnum's American Museum of Curiosities."What kind of museum is it?(LAUGHS)A place to be transported.A place where people can see thingsthey've never seen before.Huh?- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.They're all the rage in Europe. Look.Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.Come here. See?You've already met some
of the most famous folks in history.But they're not all wax.This is the great... O'Malley.Master of sleight of hand.

- (LAUGHING)The tallest giraffe in the world.CAROLINE:
Can I climb up its leg?- Absolutely not. Okay.
- (GIGGLING)Now... I know how it looks.If you didn't, I'd be worried.I mean, it just
needs a little work, but...The loan has to be paid back every month.Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.- Hundreds of them.

it's Friday, but...we sold a few.I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.Do you?She's right. You need something alive.Go to sleep, both of you.Something sensational.That's a big word.It's your word.Something that isn't stuffed.- Like a mermaid.

The joy is real.So, you are a philanthropist?Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime.Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.The creed of a true fraud.Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiledor had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.Now who's a fraud?Oh, Mr. Bennett.That word you used to describe my show?Has a nice ring to it.- (GIGGLING)
- And right this way.Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?Well, isn't that what makes it fun?Keep coming. Okay. Are you ready?- CHARITY: Is it?
- PHINEAS: It is.Come on. Let's go.Push.- Oh.
- Wow.Helen, that's for you.(GASPS)And, Caroline, this is for you.There's a ballet school
right down the street.Just past your parents' house, actually.Don't tell me you bought this housejust to rub my parents' noses

need all of this to be...- (LAUGHS)
- PHINEAS: It only took me 25 years, but...welcome home, Charity Barnum.(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS)(APPLAUSE)(INDISTINCT MURMURING)- Hello, there.
- MAN: There goes Barnum.PHINEAS: Hey, sweetheart,
who's that young man over there?Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.A bit of a scandal, they say.His last play was a hit in London.- Play?
- Mmm.You pay good money to watch people
stand around and talk for two hours,and they call me a con man.Ew, what's that smell? Do you smell that?Ew. Something does smell.Oh, I know what it is. Peanuts.(GIRLS SNICKERING)I can see it right now."Youngest prima ballerinain the history of the City Ballet."I'm quitting.What? Why would you quit?I started too late. I'll never catch up.Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.What? You think I can't spot talent?Ballet takes years of hard work.It's not like the circus.You can't just fake it.She can't quit. No.
No, I mean, she just...She just feels out of place
with the other girls.Well, I should certainly hope so.I've never seen so many
little prima Donnas in my life.Yeah, but those prima Donnas
are the most important thingin the world to her right now.She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.She shouldn't have to.New York society will never accept us.If they did, they'd have to stop judgingand actually do something
with their lives.This isn't about me.Oh.So it's different
than everything else then?I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.She is proud.We don't have to be the Carlyles.Mr. Carlyle. You produced this play?Yes, I did indeed.Refunds are available
at the front box office.(CHUCKLES) P.T. Barnum.From the circus?Yes. You... you've been?(CHUCKLES) God, no.
But I have seen the crowds.People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in,which is much more
than I can say for my play.And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.That's because I'm selling virtue.Can I buy you a drink?I wanna go after the carriage trade.Present legitimate acts,expand our appeal, go after the snobs.If you only knew how suffocating they are.So come join the circus.You clearly have a flair
for show business.Teach me how to appeal to the highbrows.- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?
(TAPS BAR)Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortableadmiring your show from afar.Comfort, the enemy of progress.Do you understand that
just associating with youcould cost me my inheritance?Oh, it could cost you more than that.You'd be risking everything.But, on the other hand, well,you just might find yourself a free man.âª âªâª Right here, right now,
I put the offer out âªâª I don't wanna chase you down,
I know you see it âªâª You run with me,
and I can cut you free âªâª Out of the drudgery

for somethin' colorful âªâª And if it's crazy,
live a little crazy âªâª You can play it sensible âªâª A king of conventional âªâª Or you can risk it all and see âªâª Don'tchu wanna get away âªâª From the same old part you gotta play? âªâª 'Cause I got what you need âªâª So come with me and take the ride âªâª It'll take you to the other side âªâª 'Cause you can do like you do
or you can do like me âªâª Stay in the cage
or you finally take the key âªâª Oh, damn âªâª Suddenly you're free to fly âªâª It'll take you to the other side âªâª Okay, my friend, you wanna cut me in âªâª Well, I hate to tell you,
but it just won't happen âªâª So thanks, but no,
I think I'm good to go âªâª 'Cause I quite enjoy the life
you say I'm trapped in âªâª Now, I admire you
and that whole show you do âªâª You're on to somethin' âªâª Really, it's somethin' âªâª But I live among the swells âªâª And we don't pick up peanut shells âªâª I'll have to leave that up to you âªâª Don'tchu know that I'm okay âªâª With this uptown part
I get to play? âªâª 'Cause I got what I need âªâª And I don't wanna take the ride âªâª I don't need to see the other side âªâª So go and do like you do,
I'm good to do like me âªâª Ain't in a cage,
so I don't need to take the key âªâª Oh, damn âªâª Can'tchu see I'm doin' fine? âªâª I don't need to see the other side âªâª Now, is this really
how you'd like to spend your days? âªâª Whisky, misery and parties and plays? âªâª If I were mixed up with you âªâª I'd be the talk of the town âªâª Disgraced and disowned,
another one of the clowns âªâª But you would finally live a little âªâª Finally laugh a little âªâª Just let me give you
the freedom to dream âªâª And it'll wake you up âªâª And cure your aching âªâª Take your walls and start 'em breaking âªâª Now that's a deal
that seems worth taking âªâª But I guess I'll leave that up to you âªâª Well, it's intriguing âªâª But to go would cost me greatly âªâª So what percentage of the show âªâª Would I be taking? âªâª Well, fair enough âªâª You'd want a piece of all the action âªâª I'd give you seven,
we could shake and make it happen âªâª I wasn't born this morning âªâª Eighteen would be just fine âªâª Why not just go ahead

- (DOOR OPENS)Folks, if you've come to get paid,the money is gone. All of it.- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.You just don't get it.Our own mothers were ashamed of us.Hid us our whole lives.Then you pull us out of the shadows.And now you're giving up on us, too.Maybe you are a fraud.Maybe it was just about making a buck.But you gave us a real family.And the circus... that was our home.We want our home back.âª I saw the sun begin to dim âªâª And felt that winter wind blow cold âªâª A man learns who is there for him âªâª When the glitter fades

1
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,525
- How are you?
- Okay.

2
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:35,994
Your leg will be fine.

3
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:40,118
A lot of shrapnel came out.
I saved you the pieces.

4
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,429
You are the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.

5
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,255
I don't think so.
Here.

6
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:48,524
- Would you kiss me?
- No. I'll get you some tea.

7
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,502
- It would mean such a lot to me.
- Would it?

8
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:00,343
Thank you.

9
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:05,832
- Nurse, I can't sleep.
- Would you kiss me?

10
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:08,830
- You're so pretty.
- Will you tuck me in, please?

11
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,580
Very funny.
Go to sleep now.

12
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,599
- Where's the doctor?
- Don't ask.

13
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:39,665
God, I hate giving blood.
Can't stand needles.

14
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:49,119
Is there anybody from Picton?

15
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,918
Picton?
I don't know.

16
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:56,028
I'd like to see somebody
from home before I go.

17
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,590
- Do we have anybody from Picton?
- Why Picton?

18
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:09,901
He's from there. Edge of Lake Ontario,
right, soldier?

19
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,368
That's where your sweetie's from,
isn't it? Around there?

20
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:16,140
Ask him what company he's with.

21
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:20,917
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.

22
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,753
Does he know Captain McGan?

23
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:30,116
He bought it yesterday.
Shot to bits.

24
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:32,754
- What did he say?
- Doesn't know him.

25
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,101
Hana, get down!

26
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:45,034
He's dead. He's dead.

27
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:50,239
He's dead.

28
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:54,181
He's dead. God!

29
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,630
<i>Name, rank, serial number?</i>

30
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,729
<i>No, sorry.</i>

31
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:24,151
I think I was a pilot.

32
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:28,175
I was found in the wreckage of a plane
at the beginning of the war.

33
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,146
Can you remember
where you were born?

34
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,876
Am I being interrogated?

35
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,516
You should be trying to
trick me, make me speak German.

36
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:39,153
- Which I can, by the way.
- Why?

37
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:41,953
- Are you German?
- No.

38
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:45,894
How do you know you're not German
if you don't remember anything?

39
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,659
Might... Might I have
a sip of water?

40
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,202
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

41
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,735
I remember lots of things.

42
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:11,327
I remember her garden,
plunging down to the sea.

43
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,867
- Nothing between you and France.
- This was your garden?

44
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:17,821
- Or my wife's.
- You were married then?

45
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:22,230
I think so. Although I believe that
to be true of a number of Germans.

46
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,603
Look.

47
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,402
I have this much lung.

48
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,633
The rest of my organs
are packing up.

49
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:36,093
What could it possibly matter
if I'm a Tutankhamen?

50
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,239
I'm a bit of...
toast, my friend.

51
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:44,012
Sorry I can't help you.

52
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,321
Are you all right?

53
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,437
I know you hate to be moved.
I'm sorry.

54
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,374
Hana!

55
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:13,849
- Jan?
- Hana! Hana!

56
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:17,574
There's meant to be lace in the next
village. The boys are gonna take me.

57
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,597
- You don't have any money, do ya?
- No.

58
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:21,503
- Just in case there's a sale.
- No.

59
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,686
Hana, I know you do.
Come on.

60
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:25,319
- No!
- Oh, come on.

61
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:27,921
I swear to God,
this'll be the last time. I swear.

62
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,593
She's a softie.
She loves me.

63
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:35,004
I'll pay you back! I promise!

64
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:37,920
I'm not sewing
anything else for you.

65
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:41,099
I love you!

66
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:44,505
Whoa!
Pienza, boys!

67
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:03,900
Get some water over here!

68
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:08,098
Jan! Oh, no!

69
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:12,567
Hana, where're you going?

70
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,908
- Stay back!
- Stop, Hana!

71
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:18,010
Stay...

72
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:25,604
No!

73
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,584
No!

74
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,721
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't move!

75
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,495
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

76
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,780
Stand absolutely still!

77
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,808
You're walking in a mine field!

78
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:28,022
Good.

79
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,878
That's good.

80
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:34,123
Just stay still for me...

81
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,689
and we'll be fine.

82
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:40,581
What are you doing?

83
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:43,806
What the bloody hell do
you think you're doing?

84
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:48,137
It's Jan's.

85
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,493
Are you in pain?
Do you need something?

86
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:20,870
- Yes.
- Okay.

87
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:24,935
Are you okay?

88
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,076
- You and Jan were...
- We keep moving him in and out of the truck.

89
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:31,287
Why? He's dying.
What's the point?

90
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:33,968
We can hardly leave him.
Do you mean leave him?

91
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,779
No, no, I don't mean leave him.

92
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:49,200
This will help you.

93
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,665
I must be a curse.

94
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:56,595
Anybody who loves me...

95
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,393
anybody who gets close to me...

96
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,109
Oh, I must be cursed.

97
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:11,722
Which is it?

98
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:41,333
- When he dies, I'll catch up.
- It's not safe here.

99
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:45,114
The whole country's crawling with
bandits and Germans and God knows what.

100
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:47,685
- It's madness! I can't allow it.
- The war is over.

101
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,981
How can it be desertion?

102
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:52,362
It's not over everywhere.
I didn't mean literally.

103
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:56,147
This is normal, a shock,
for all of us, Hana.

104
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,608
I need morphine, a lot.
And a pistol.

105
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:07,866
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

106
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,705
We're heading for Leghorn.

107
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:16,075
"Livorno", the Italians call it.

108
00:17:17,097 --> 00:17:18,910
We'll expect you.

109
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,690
Fine.

110
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,516
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

111
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,626
- Oh, Hana.
- I'll be okay.

112
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:47,682
I'll catch up.
Good.

113
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:57,079
What... What was
all that banging?

114
00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:01,777
Are you... Are you fighting rats
or the entire German army?

115
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:06,894
No. I was repairing
the stairs.

116
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:11,254
I found a library,
and the books were very useful.

117
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,849
Before you find too many
uses for those books,

118
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:17,464
you might read some to me.

119
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,983
I think they're all in Italian,
but I'll look, yes.

120
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:22,708
- What about your own book?
- My book?

121
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,962
Oh, yes, the Herodotus.

122
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,037
Yes, you can read him.

123
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:32,130
Oh. I found plums.

124
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:35,927
We have plums
in the orchard. There.

125
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,622
We have an orchard.

126
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:42,831
Herodotus is
the father of history.

127
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:45,625
- Do you know that?
- I don't know anything.

128
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:57,972
Hmm.

129
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:08,259
It's a...

130
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:11,587
It's a very plum...

131
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,735
plum.

132
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:43,512
A mountain the shape
of a woman's back. Good, good.

133
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:10,916
- Hello, Geoffrey!
- Madox, hello!

134
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:14,080
- Welcome to the expedition.
- How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton.

135
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,346
Splendid to finally
meet you all.

136
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:18,557
This is Dante D'Agostino
and Diggy Bermann, our archaeologists.

137
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,853
- Beautiful plane.
- And this is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist.

138
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,416
- And this is my wife, Katharine.
- Hello.

139
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:24,518
We're your new apprentices.

140
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,180
Welcome to the International Sand Club.

141
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:32,024
- To the International Sand Club.
- I'll get cups.

142
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,529
- Marvellous plane. Did you look?
- Yes.

143
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:37,658
Isn't it? A wedding present
from Katharine's parents.

144
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:39,629
We're calling it Rupert Bear.

145
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:42,082
- Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
- Almásy.

146
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,740
We can finally consign my old bird
to the scrap heap.

147
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:48,706
Mrs. Clifton,
I'd like to present...

148
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,280
- Count Almásy.
- Hello.

149
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:53,769
Geoffrey gave me your monograph
and I was reading up in the desert.

150
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,215
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

151
00:22:56,285 --> 00:23:00,354
I wanted to meet the man who could write
a long paper with so few adjectives.

152
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:04,383
Well, a thing is still a thing,
no matter what you place in front of it.

153
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:08,397
Big car, slow car,
chauffeur-driven car.

154
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:11,400
Broken car. It's still a car.

155
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:14,767
- Not much use, though.
- Love?

156
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:18,735
Romantic love,
platonic love, filial love.

157
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:21,239
- Quite different things, surely.
- Uxoriousness.

158
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,605
That's my favourite kind of love.
Excessive love of one's wife.

159
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:29,825
Now there you have me.

160
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,955
- They're tourists.
- Absolute rot.

161
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,682
They're highly recommended
by the Royal Geographic Society.

162
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,616
She's charming and
has read everything.

163
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:39,709
- He's meant to be a ruddy good flier.
- We don't need another pilot.

164
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,287
He can make aerial maps
of the whole route.

165
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:44,494
You can't explore
from the air, Madox.

166
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,560
If you could explore from the air,
life would be very simple.

167
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,460
Contact.

168
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:54,196
Contact.

169
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:12,976
I should try and move the bed.

170
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,881
I want you to be able
to see the view.

171
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:19,190
It's good. It's a view
from a monastery.

172
00:25:19,262 --> 00:25:22,720
- I can already see.
- How?

173
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,529
- How can you see anything?
- No, no, not the window.

174
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:28,298
I can't bear the light anyway.

175
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:30,862
I can see all the way
to the desert.

176
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,057
I'm turning you.

177
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,776
Exploring before the war,
making maps.

178
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:40,119
Is there sand in my eyes?
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

179
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,652
No sand.
That's your morphine speaking.

180
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:53,355
I can see my wife in that view.

181
00:25:55,832 --> 00:25:58,824
Are you remembering more?

182
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:02,167
- Could I have a cigarette?
- Are you crazy?

183
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:11,110
Why... Why are you so determined
to keep me alive?

184
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:14,833
Because I'm a nurse.

185
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,009
Bravo.

- Next!
- Katharine!

191
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,595
"The King insisted that
he would find some way...

192
00:27:33,663 --> 00:27:35,435
"to prove beyond dispute...

193
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:39,862
"that his wife
was fairest of all women.

194
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:43,565
"'I will hide you in your room
where we sleep,' said Candaules...

195
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,234
- "said Candaules."
- Candaules.

196
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:48,937
"Candaules".

197
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:51,139
Candaules.

198
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:55,207
Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen has
the same practice every night.

199
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,254
She takes off her clothes...

200
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:02,257
and puts them on the chair
by the door to her room.

201
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,793
"'And from where you stand,

202
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:08,388
"'you will be able to gaze
on her at your leisure."'

203
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,394
And that evening, it's exactly as
the King has told him.

204
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,083
She goes to the chair,

205
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:17,271
removes her clothes one by one,

206
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:21,701
until she's standing naked
in full view of Gyges.

207
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:26,442
And indeed, she was more lovely
than he could have imagined.

208
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:30,111
But then, the Queen looked up...

209
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:34,317
and saw Gyges concealed
in the shadows.

210
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:36,985
And although she said
nothing, she shuddered.

211
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,363
And the next day,

212
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:49,166
she sends for... for Gyges
and challenged him.

213
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:53,642
- And hearing his story, this is what she said.
- Off with his head!

214
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:01,106
She said, "Either you
must submit to death...

215
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,981
"for gazing on that
which you should not,

216
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,545
"or else kill my husband
who has shamed me...

217
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:11,519
"and become King in his place."

218
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,358
So Gyges kills the King,

219
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:20,563
marries the Queen and becomes ruler
of Lydia for 28 years.

220
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,473
The end.

221
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,840
Shall I spin the bottle?

222
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:32,336
So, Geoffrey,
let that be a lesson to you.

223
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:34,836
- D'Agostino!
- D'Agostino!

224
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,653
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

225
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:42,317
Yes.

226
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:45,657
No. I'm dropping off.

227
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:31,087
Go away!

228
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:33,802
Go! Go!

229
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:51,203
Buon giorno.

230
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:54,664
- Hana?
- What do you want?

231
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:57,666
I met your friend Mary.

232
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:00,327
She said I should stop and see
if you were all right.

233
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:05,887
Apparently we're neighbours. My house
is two blocks from yours in Montreal.

234
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,927
Cabot, north of Laurier.

235
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:12,602
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

236
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:15,156
For you.

237
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:18,181
I'd like to take credit for it,
but it's from Mary.

238
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:21,849
My name is David Caravaggio,
but nobody ever called me David.

239
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:26,521
Caravaggio they find
too absurd to miss out on.

240
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:28,257
Oh!

241
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:30,799
Oh!

242
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,097
Oh, shit.
Stupid hands.

243
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:37,155
Let me do that.

244
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:44,974
They're fresh.

245
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:47,482
I haven't had an egg in...

246
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:52,478
Have you noticed
there are chickens?

247
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,750
In Italy, you get chickens
but no eggs.

248
00:31:54,824 --> 00:31:57,945
In Africa, they're always eggs
but never chickens.

249
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:01,130
- Who's separating them?
- You were in Africa?

250
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,366
Yes, I was.

251
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:06,382
So was my patient.

252
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,657
Look, I'd like to
stay for a while.

253
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,246
I have to do some work here.

254
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:14,649
I speak the language.
There are partisans to be disarmed.

255
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:18,511
We embrace them and see
if we can relieve them of their weapons,

256
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,640
you know, while we hide.

257
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:24,278
I was a thief, so the army
thought I'd be good at it.

258
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:27,152
- So you can shoot a pistol?
- No.

259
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:30,840
Do you have a problem
with those?

260
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:33,395
No.

261
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:36,091
- Well, I should look at them before you go.
- Look.

262
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:39,144
It's a big place.
We needn't disturb each other.

263
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,899
I'll sleep in the stable.

264
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,681
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don't sleep.

265
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:45,807
I don't know what Mary told you
about me, but I don't need company.

266
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,914
I don't need to be looked after.

267
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:56,714
There is a man downstairs.

268
00:32:56,786 --> 00:33:00,187
He brought us eggs.
He might stay.

269
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:03,123
Why? Can he lay eggs?

270
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:05,286
He's Canadian.

271
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:09,388
Why are people always so happy when they
collide with one from the same place?

272
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:12,367
What happened in Montreal
when you passed a man in the street?

273
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:15,529
Did you invite him
to live with you?

274
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,238
He needn't disturb you.

275
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:22,466
He can't. I'm already disturbed.

276
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:28,716
There's a war. Where you come from
becomes important.

277
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:32,346
Why? I hate that idea.

278
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:40,463
Ah! It's gonna work.

279
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:44,125
Gently.

280
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:50,671
Can I help?

281
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:52,147
It's finished.

282
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,472
So, you're our
Canadian pickpocket?

283
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,551
"Thief" I think is more accurate.

284
00:33:57,637 --> 00:34:01,876
I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?

285
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:04,545
Oh, all over.

286
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:07,886
All over?

287
00:34:07,957 --> 00:34:11,175
I kept trying to cover
a very modest portion and still failed.

288
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:13,214
- Are you leaving us?
- Yes.

289
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:17,425
Now's our opportunity
to swap war wounds.

290
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:20,774
Then I'm definitely going.

291
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,627
Does she have war wounds?

292
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:29,240
I think anybody
she ever loves...

293
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:31,610
tends to die on her.

294
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:34,707
- Are you planning to be the exception?
- Me?

295
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,339
I think you've got...

296
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,451
the wrong end
of the stick, old boy.

297
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,467
So...

298
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:44,936
Caravaggio.

299
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:47,625
Hana thinks
you invented your name.

300
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,764
And you've forgotten yours.

301
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:55,497
I said that no one would ever invent
such a preposterous name.

302
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:57,904
And I said you can
forget everything,

303
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:02,850
but you never forget your name.

304
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,878
Count Almásy.

305
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:07,280
That name mean anything to you?

306
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,716
<i>Or Katharine Clifton?</i>

307
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:20,262
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,493
- How much did you pay?
- Oh, hello.

309
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:27,468
They don't see foreign women
in this market. How much did you pay?

310
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:30,258
Um, £7 or £8, I suppose.

311
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,740
- Which store?
- Why?

312
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:36,176
You've been cheated.
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.

313
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:37,826
I don't want to take it back.

314
00:35:37,865 --> 00:35:41,693
- This is not worth £8.
- It is to me.

315
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:44,042
- Did you bargain?
- I don't care to bargain.

316
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,315
That insults them.

317
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:51,314
I don't believe that. I think
that you're insulted by me somehow.

318
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,724
I'd be very happy to obtain
the correct price for this.

319
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,827
I apologize if I appear abrupt.

320
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,300
I'm rusty at social graces.

321
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,623
How do you find Cairo?

322
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:10,643
- Did you visit the pyramids?
- Excuse me.

323
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:13,695
Or the Sphinx?

324
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:20,920
Latitude, 25, 33.
Longitude, 25, 16.

325
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,926
We attempt to drive north-east of Kofer,
we'll leave our bones in the desert.

326
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:27,428
- I disagree.
- You're Hungarian. You always disagree.

327
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:29,301
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

328
00:36:29,343 --> 00:36:31,887
- How is your charming wife?
- Marvellous. She...

329
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,107
She's in love
with the hotel plumbing.

330
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,330
She's either in the swimming pool.
She swims for hours.

331
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:39,307
She's a fish. It's quite incredible.
Or she's in the bath.

332
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:42,960
Actually, she's just outside.

333
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:46,627
Chaps only in the Long Bar.

334
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,148
Mrs. Clifton.

335
00:36:54,398 --> 00:36:57,082
You'll have to forgive us. We're not
accustomed to the company of women.

336
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,857
Not at all. I was thoroughly
enjoying my book.

337
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,992
- The team is in mourning, darling.
- Oh, really?

338
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:07,199
I'm afraid we're not having much luck
obtaining funds for the expedition.

339
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,204
Oh. Well, what'll you do?

340
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:11,706
More modest expedition,
or even wait a year.

341
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:14,766
- It's a disaster.
- Remind our families we still exist.

342
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:16,586
Good heavens,
are you married, Madox?

343
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:19,760
Very much so.
We all are.

344
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,842
- Save my friend Almásy here.
- I feel much better.

345
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:26,598
Don't you, darling?
We were feeling rather self-conscious.

346
00:37:26,818 --> 00:37:28,549
Well let's toast, then.
Absent wives.

347
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:31,354
- Absent wives.
- And present ones.

348
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:33,054
And future ones.

349
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:56,051
Thank you.

350
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:59,440
Excuse me.
May I?

351
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,735
- Why did you follow me yesterday?
- I'm sorry. What?

352
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,633
After the market,
you followed me to the hotel.

353
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:23,839
I was concerned. A woman
in that part of Cairo, a European woman.

354
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:26,404
- I felt obliged to.
- You felt obliged to?

355
00:38:26,482 --> 00:38:29,349
As the wife of one of our party.

356
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:32,479
So why follow me?
Escort me, by all means.

357
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:35,820
But following me
is predatory, isn't it?

358
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,840
Could I ask you to move?

359
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,865
I'm sorry, but I...

360
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:29,645
I'm sorry. Of course.

361
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:32,647
- It's just when you move.
- How stupid of me.

362
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:37,345
- I can't really bear the pressure. I'm...
- Are you all right?

363
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,307
I was dreaming. Awful.

364
00:40:30,506 --> 00:40:32,440
Hana.

365
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:38,739
Hana, are you all right?

366
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:41,408
Leave me alone.

367
00:41:02,744 --> 00:41:05,008
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

368
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:07,867
Your poor patient.

369
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:10,459
You think he's a saint
because of the way he looks.

370
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:13,627
I don't think he is.

371
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,578
I'm not so in love with him.

372
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:20,785
I'm in love with ghosts.

373
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,950
So is he.
He's in love with ghosts.

374
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:26,737
What if I told you
he did this to me?

375
00:41:29,498 --> 00:41:32,277
How could he have? When?

376
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:34,907
I'm one of his ghosts,
and he wouldn't even know it.

377
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:39,650
- I don't know what that means.
- Ask your saint who he is.

378
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:43,118
Ask him who he's killed.

379
00:41:47,063 --> 00:41:50,485
Please, don't creep
around this house.

380
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:52,953
See, I don't think
he's forgotten anything!

381
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:55,889
I think he wants to forget!

382
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,125
<i>Gentlemen, to mapmaking.</i>

383
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:01,358
To mapmaking!

384
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,530
And a special thank you
to Geoffrey and Katharine,

385
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,464
without whose fund-raising heroics,
we'd still be kicking our heels.

386
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,305
- To arm-twisting.
- Arm-twisting.

387
00:42:11,374 --> 00:42:14,847
Did Katharine say Geoffrey
has to fly back to Cairo?

388
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:18,308
Return the favour.
Take a few photographs for the army.

389
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:20,781
Oh, um, what kind
of photographs?

390
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,721
Portraits.

391
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:25,320
The brigadier,
the brigadier's wife,

392
00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:29,415
the brigadier's dog, brigadier
by the pyramids, brigadier breathing.

393
00:42:29,898 --> 00:42:32,389
And I shall,
of course, be bereft.

394
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,894
I'll finally be able to
explore the Cairo nightlife.

395
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:37,899
I shall produce an authoritative guide
to the zinc bars and...

396
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:40,983
I want to say hareems. Are we
in the right country for hareems?

397
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:42,980
Harems.

398
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:50,403
- Bye, my love.
- Travel safe.

399
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:53,062
Catch up in a week.

400
00:42:55,384 --> 00:42:58,717
Clifton, safe journey.

401
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:03,054
You too. Good luck.
Glad the funds have turned up.

402
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,094
Clifton.

403
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:11,792
This is probably
none of my business.

404
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,700
Your wife.

405
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,069
- Do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
- Appropriate?

406
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,906
Well, the desert is, it's, uh...
for a woman, it's very tough.

407
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,241
I wonder if it's
not too much for her.

408
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,804
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.
She told me yesterday.

409
00:43:26,882 --> 00:43:29,908
- All the same, were I you...
- I've known Katharine since she was three.

410
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:32,102
We were practically brother and sister
before we were man and wife.

411
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:35,189
I think I'd know what is and what isn't
too much for her.

412
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:38,090
I think she'd know herself.

413
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,453
Very well.

414
00:43:39,477 --> 00:43:42,378
Why are you people
so threatened by a woman?

415
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:27,936
I have come to love...

416
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,810
that little tap of the
fingernail against the syringe.

417
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:33,889
Tap.

418
00:44:35,684 --> 00:44:37,053
Tap.

419
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:40,555
Tap.

420
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,906
Stop playing! Please, stop playing.

421
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,520
I don't have the key
to that door. You...

422
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:18,722
The Germans were here.
The Germans were all over this area.

423
00:45:18,794 --> 00:45:21,262
They left mines everywhere.

424
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,821
And pianos were their
favourite hiding places.

425
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:26,333
I see. Sorry.

426
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,406
Then maybe you're safe
as long as you only play Bach.

427
00:45:36,846 --> 00:45:39,076
He's German.

428
00:45:40,422 --> 00:45:42,978
Is something funny?

429
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:45,452
No. I'm sorry.

430
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:02,990
I've met you before.

431
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:05,930
I don't think so.

432
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:18,153
Look. See?

433
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,513
Move that, and no more Bach.

434
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:24,759
Lieutenant!
Are you all right, sir?

435
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,756
Fine, Sergeant.

436
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,263
So you're working
with the Italians.

437
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:31,976
Yeah, trying to get them
to give up their weapons.

438
00:46:32,078 --> 00:46:34,804
I was a thief, so the army
thought I'd be good at it.

439
00:46:34,906 --> 00:46:36,670
- I like the Italians.
- Really?

440
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:39,037
He wants us to move out.

441
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:42,600
He says there could be
50 more mines in the building.

442
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:47,047
He thinks I'm mad
because I laugh at him.

443
00:46:47,116 --> 00:46:50,108
He's Indian.

444
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:53,856
- He wears a turban.
- No, he's Sikh.

445
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:56,523
If he wears a turban, he's Sikh.

446
00:46:57,036 --> 00:46:58,617
I'll probably marry him.

447
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:01,891
Really? That's sudden.

448
00:47:01,964 --> 00:47:03,955
My mother always told me...

449
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:07,764
I would summon my husband
by playing the piano.

450
00:47:13,976 --> 00:47:18,186
- I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
- Why? Is he staying?

451
00:47:18,284 --> 00:47:21,014
With his sergeant,
a Mr. Hardy.

452
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:26,043
We should charge.
Doesn't anyone have a job to do?

453
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:30,057
They have to clear all the roads
of mines. That's a big job.

454
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,322
In that case, I...
I suppose we can't charge.

455
00:47:33,957 --> 00:47:36,448
No, we can't.

456
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:41,235
Thank you.

I've been thinking. How does someone
like you decide to come to the desert?

461
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,603
What is it? You...

462
00:48:39,665 --> 00:48:43,649
You're doing whatever you're doing in
your castle, or wherever it is you live,

463
00:48:43,743 --> 00:48:47,095
and one day you say,
"I have to get to the desert", or what?

464
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:51,902
I once travelled with a guide
who was taking me to Faya.

465
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:56,193
He didn't speak for nine hours.

466
00:48:58,347 --> 00:49:03,046
At the end of it, he pointed
at the horizon and said, "Faya."

467
00:49:04,112 --> 00:49:06,053
That was a good day.

468
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:19,258
Actually, you sing.

469
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:23,455
- What?
- You sing.

470
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:25,975
All the time.

471
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,335
- I do not.
- Ask Al Auf.

472
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,531

480
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:21,599
Thanks.

481
00:51:58,223 --> 00:51:59,922
Madox!

482
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,020
Madox!

483
00:52:02,097 --> 00:52:04,031
Madox!

484
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:07,466
- Come quickly! I've found something!
- What is it?

485
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:11,495
D'Ag! Bermann! Quick!

486
00:52:28,724 --> 00:52:30,715
My God.

487
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:34,691
They're swimming.

488
00:52:39,735 --> 00:52:42,169
They're swimming.

489
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,991
Ow!

490
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:19,204
- You okay?
- Yeah.

491
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,021
How do you explain...

492
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:50,122
to someone who has never been here,

493
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:54,504
feelings which seem quite normal?

494
00:53:57,974 --> 00:54:00,917
I don't know, my friend.

495
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,512
I don't know.

496
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:09,524
- Aaah!
- Kamal!

497
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:11,455
Bermann, what are you doing?

498
00:54:12,391 --> 00:54:13,658
Bermann!

499
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,746
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

500
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:31,470
- Get them out of the car!
- Let me help!

501
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,587
Almásy, are you all right?

502
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,727
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

503
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,544
My wrist! Ah!

504
00:54:56,346 --> 00:55:00,033
I'll be back as quick as I can,
36 hours at the outside.

505
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,908
Try to get
an additional radiator.

506
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:06,951
We can store it between here
and Pottery Hill. And a better jack.

507
00:55:07,176 --> 00:55:10,634
- We planned badly.
- Bermann?

508
00:55:24,585 --> 00:55:26,485
Safe journey.

509
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:30,601
Now what?

510
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,908
Let's get all this stuff off.

511
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:36,949
- I'll stay behind, of course.
- Certainly not.

512
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:39,683
- I caused the problem. I shall stay.
- You can't. None of you can.

513
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:42,886
No, I insist. There clearly
isn't room for all of us.

514
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:45,925
I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not
one of the walking wounded.

515
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:47,926
It's only one night.

516
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:51,237
If I remain, it's the most effective
method of persuading my husband...

517
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:54,698
to abandon whatever he's doing
and come and rescue us.

518
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,595
- All right.
- Come on, let's get going.

519
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:46,116
I thought you might like to
paste them into your book.

520
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,686
Well, we...

521
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:57,260
We took photographs.

522
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:01,769
There's no need.

523
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,080
No, really.
I'd like you to have them.

524
00:57:05,107 --> 00:57:07,598
Well, there's really no need.
This is, um...

525
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:10,900
This is just a scrapbook.
They are too good.

526
00:57:10,953 --> 00:57:15,452
I should feel obliged.
Thank you.

527
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:33,224
And that would be unconscionable,
I suppose, wouldn't it?

528
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,244
To feel any obligation.

529
00:57:39,597 --> 00:57:42,532
Yes, of course it would.

530
00:58:11,504 --> 00:58:14,029
You should come into the shelter.

531
00:58:14,341 --> 00:58:16,332
I'm quite all right, thank you.

532
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:20,253
- Look over there.
- What am I looking at?

533
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,479
Do you see what's happening
to them, the stars?

534
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:26,727
- They're so untidy. I was trying to rearrange them.
- No, no.

535
00:58:27,118 --> 00:58:29,086
Over there.

536
00:58:32,528 --> 00:58:34,685
In a few minutes,
there'll be no stars.

537
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,126
The air is filling with sand.

538
00:59:40,322 --> 00:59:43,951
- This is not very good, is it?
- No.

539
00:59:47,612 --> 00:59:51,241
- Will we be all right?
- Yes.

540
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,937
Yes.

541
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,204
Absolutely.

542
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,993
"Yes" is a comfort.
"Absolutely" is not.

543
01:00:15,795 --> 01:00:19,162
Let me tell you about winds.

544
01:00:19,232 --> 01:00:22,701
There is a, a whirlwind
from southern Morocco,

545
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:24,424
the Aajej,

546
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:28,269
against which the Fellahin
defend themselves with knives.

547
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:33,945
And there is a,
a Ghibli from Tunis.

548
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:36,345
- A Ghibli?
- A Ghibli.

549
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:40,181
Which rolls and rolls
and rolls and produces a...

550
01:00:41,063 --> 01:00:43,711
a rather strange nervous condition.

551
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:49,918
And then there is the,
the Harmatten,

552
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:54,797
a red wind, which mariners call
"the sea of darkness".

553
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,059
And red sand from this wind...

554
01:00:58,137 --> 01:01:01,038
has flown as far as
the south coast of England,

555
01:01:01,107 --> 01:01:03,541
apparently producing...

556
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:07,010
showers so dense that they were
mistaken for blood.

557
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:09,843
Fiction!

558
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:13,942
We have a house on that coast
and it has never, never rained blood.

559
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,955
No, it's all true.
Herodotus, your friend.

560
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:19,287
- My friend.
- Your fri...

561
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:21,952
He writes about it...

562
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:25,486
and he writes about...

563
01:01:25,564 --> 01:01:28,965
a... a wind, the Simoon,

564
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:31,800
which a nation thought was so evil,

565
01:01:31,842 --> 01:01:35,278
they declared war on it
and marched out against it.

566
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,941
In full battle dress.

567
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:44,014
Their swords raised.

568
01:02:09,067 --> 01:02:12,661
Katharine, Katharine, I need
to get out your side, quickly.

569
01:02:12,716 --> 01:02:14,711
A car! Let me out!

570
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,544
Of course. I'm sorry.

571
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:19,846
Ridiculous to fall asleep!

572
01:02:19,919 --> 01:02:21,978
Unforgivable!

573
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:24,488
Damn! The flare!

574
01:02:26,092 --> 01:02:28,026
Stop! Over here!

575
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:30,090
Here!

576
01:02:30,474 --> 01:02:32,653
Stop!

577
01:02:33,185 --> 01:02:35,860
Madox!

578
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:39,336
Madox! Madox!

579
01:02:53,164 --> 01:02:54,789
Our tracks have disappeared.

580
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:58,331
Madox will calculate how many miles.
He'll soon turn around.

581
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:06,565
Could I ask you, please, to...

582
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:10,755
paste your paintings
into my book.

583
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:14,873
I-I should like to have them.
I should be honoured.

584
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:20,791
The others!

585
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,372
- Oh, God.
- Quick!

586
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:32,010
Oh, how awful!
We've got to get them out.

587
01:03:32,078 --> 01:03:34,808
Quick! Get the other shovel!

588
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:41,881
Am I a terrible coward
to ask how much water we have left?

589
01:03:41,974 --> 01:03:45,998
A little in our can. We have, uh, water
in the radiator, which can be drunk.

590
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:50,536
And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.
It's extremely practical.

591
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,442
We, uh... Oh, come on!
Come on!

592
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,539
There's also a plant.

593
01:03:57,616 --> 01:04:01,985
I've never seen it, but I believe you can cut
a piece the size of a heart from this plant,

594
01:04:02,054 --> 01:04:05,490
and the next morning it'll be filled
with a delicious liquid.

595
01:04:05,558 --> 01:04:09,392
Find that plant,
cut out its heart.

596
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,566
Here.

597
01:04:22,911 --> 01:04:23,973
Here's the window.

598
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:27,012
Clear the glass. I'll clear the door.
Mind your hands.

599
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:30,139
It's okay. We're here.

600
01:04:30,216 --> 01:04:32,776
Come on, clear it quickly.

601
01:04:35,252 --> 01:04:38,244
Hang on. Coming.

602
01:04:46,198 --> 01:04:50,328
- I've got it. I've got it. Help them out.
- Here.

603
01:06:00,992 --> 01:06:02,905
Katharine.

604
01:06:07,886 --> 01:06:09,820
Water.

605
01:06:26,642 --> 01:06:28,940
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.

606
01:06:31,793 --> 01:06:34,470
He's not actually a buffoon.

607
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:36,418
The plane wasn't
a wedding present.

608
01:06:36,468 --> 01:06:39,164
It belongs
to the British government.

609
01:06:39,378 --> 01:06:42,745
They want aerial maps
of the whole of North Africa.

610
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,829
So I think he's in Ethiopia.

611
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:50,850
In case you're counting
on his sudden appearance.

612
01:06:54,893 --> 01:06:57,521
And the marriage.

613
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:59,860
Is that a fiction?

614
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:04,928
No, the marriage
isn't a fiction.

615
01:07:10,706 --> 01:07:12,907
Oh, thank God.

616
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:15,103
Thank God.

617
01:07:15,488 --> 01:07:18,668
Madox. It's Madox.

618
01:07:23,455 --> 01:07:26,322
Am I K. in your book?

619
01:07:26,392 --> 01:07:28,656
I think I must be.

620
01:07:51,592 --> 01:07:53,060
Chapter one.

621
01:07:53,178 --> 01:07:58,049
"He sat in defiance of municipal orders
astride the gun Zamzammah..."

622
01:07:58,123 --> 01:08:02,404
I can't read these words. I can't
read them. They stick in my throat.

623
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:04,458
Because you're
reading it too fast.

624
01:08:04,505 --> 01:08:07,568
- Not at all.
- You have to read Kipling slowly.

625
01:08:07,637 --> 01:08:11,566
Your eye is too impatient.
Think about the speed of his pen.

626
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:14,591
What is it?
"He sat, comma,

627
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:18,016
"in defiance of
municipal orders, comma,

628
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,532
"astride the gun Zamzammah...

629
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:23,969
"on her brick..."
What is it?

630
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:27,258
"Brick platform, opposite the old
Ajaib-Gher."

631
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:32,127
"The wonder house, comma,

632
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:35,652
"as the natives called
the Lahore Museum."

633
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:38,993
It's still there, the cannon,
outside the museum.

634
01:08:39,064 --> 01:08:43,380
Made of metal cups and bowls taken
from every household in the city as tax,

635
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,199
then melted down.

636
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:49,331
Then later, they fired
the cannon at my people,

637
01:08:49,408 --> 01:08:53,174
comma, the natives.

638
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:55,179
Full stop.

639
01:08:57,249 --> 01:08:59,183
What exactly
is it you object to?

640
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:02,152
The writer,
or what he's writing about?

641
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,939
What I really object to, Uncle,

642
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:08,456
is your finishing
all my condensed milk.

643
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:11,462
And the message everywhere in your book,
however slowly I read it,

644
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:14,381
that the best thing for India
is to be ruled by the British.

645
01:09:14,436 --> 01:09:18,100
Hana, we have discovered
a shared pleasure, the boy and I.

646
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,729
- Arguing about books?
- Condensed milk.

647
01:09:20,954 --> 01:09:23,184
One of the truly
great inventions.

648
01:09:23,623 --> 01:09:26,009
I'll get another tin.

649
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:29,707
I didn't like that book either.
It's all about men.

650
01:09:30,015 --> 01:09:33,473
Too many men.
Just like this house.

651
01:09:34,107 --> 01:09:36,754
You like him, don't you?
Your voice changes.

652
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:39,256
No, I don't think it does.

653
01:09:39,324 --> 01:09:42,044
Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

654
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:45,022
I don't think it's indifference.

655
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,987
- Hana was just telling me, you're indifferent...
- Hey!

656
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:50,117
...to her cooking.

657
01:09:51,956 --> 01:09:53,227
Well, I'm indifferent
to cooking.

658
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:56,103
Not Hana's cooking
in particular.

659
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:59,440
Have either of you tried
condensed milk sandwiches?

660
01:10:01,817 --> 01:10:04,718
They're very good with salt.

661
01:10:25,235 --> 01:10:27,499
Welcome back, Madam.

662
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,941
Will you not come in?

663
01:10:43,089 --> 01:10:44,182
No.

664
01:10:44,683 --> 01:10:47,308
- I should go home.
- Will you please come in?

665
01:10:48,776 --> 01:10:50,710
Mrs. Clifton.

666
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:55,593
Don't.

667
01:10:56,315 --> 01:10:58,283
I believe
you still have my book.

668
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,710
Thank you.

669
01:12:39,905 --> 01:12:42,840
You still have
sand in your hair.

I'm impressed you can sew.

674
01:13:18,744 --> 01:13:20,678
Good.

675
01:13:27,924 --> 01:13:30,381
You sew very badly.

676
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:32,787
Well, you don't sew at all.

677
01:13:33,143 --> 01:13:34,792
A woman should
never learn to sew,

678
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,454
and if she can,
she shouldn't admit to it.

679
01:13:45,237 --> 01:13:48,263
Close your eyes.

680
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:51,366
It makes it harder still.

681
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:55,668
Hmm.

682
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,848
When were you most happy?

683
01:14:02,826 --> 01:14:04,616
Now.

684
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,758
And when were you least happy?

685
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,001
Now.

686
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:19,714
- What do you love?
- What do I love?

687
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,731
- Say everything.
- Let's see.

688
01:14:23,809 --> 01:14:25,902
- Water.
- Mm-hmm.

689
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,909
Fish in it.

690
01:14:30,982 --> 01:14:33,521
And hedgehogs.
I love hedgehogs.

691
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,138
And what else?

692
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:38,186
Marmite. I'm addicted.

693
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:43,778
And baths. But not with other people.

694
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:50,726
Islands.

695
01:14:52,838 --> 01:14:55,272
And your handwriting.

696
01:14:57,242 --> 01:15:00,268
- Mmm.
- I could go on all day.

697
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,453
Go on all day.

698
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:12,687
My husband.

699
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:17,060
And what do you hate most?

700
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,064
A lie.

701
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,466
What do you hate most?

702
01:15:31,044 --> 01:15:33,303
Ownership.

703
01:15:33,378 --> 01:15:35,471
Being owned.

704
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:39,599
When you leave,
you should forget me.

705
01:16:09,548 --> 01:16:13,006
<i>- Who is this?
- Don't you recognize me?</i>

706
01:16:13,701 --> 01:16:16,815
Is it you? So fat.

707
01:16:21,927 --> 01:16:25,255
- Hmm.
- That's a Christmas cracker.

708
01:16:25,505 --> 01:16:27,175
Firecracker.

709
01:16:27,184 --> 01:16:30,200
- This isn't your handwriting, is it?
- Yes, it is.

is for Katharine.

Say you're feeling faint. The heat.

725
01:17:45,605 --> 01:17:48,472
- No.
- I can't work.

726
01:17:48,519 --> 01:17:52,379
- I can't sleep.
- Katharine.

727
01:17:53,356 --> 01:17:54,611
Coming.

728
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:59,932
I can't sleep. I wake up shouting
in the middle of the night.

729

- Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, trauma.
- I can still taste you.

730
01:18:08,363 --> 01:18:10,738
- Fill up this. It's empty.
- Oh.

731
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:14,682
I try to write,
with your taste in my mouth.

732
01:18:18,087 --> 01:18:20,577
Swoon.

733
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,866
They'll catch you.

734
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:29,249
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

735
01:18:40,212 --> 01:18:42,665
- Come along with me now!
- Merry Christmas, everyone!

736
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,491

- Oh.

738
01:18:47,954 --> 01:18:49,597
Fetch a chair.

739
01:18:49,674 --> 01:18:51,642
No, I'm fine.

740
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,974
- It's this heat. It's terrible.
- Is she all right?

741
01:18:54,045 --> 01:18:56,878
- She's quite all right.
- Oh, good.

742
01:18:56,948 --> 01:18:59,712
- Are you pregnant?
- Oh, I don't think so, no.

743
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:01,775
How romantic.

744
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:04,185
With Fiona, I fell over
every five minutes.

Anything green, or rain.

It's Christmas and it's all...
Oh, I don't know.

776

If you wanted.

you do so love a disguise.

I do so love you.

780
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:10,133
Mmm.

781
01:23:11,605 --> 01:23:14,540
- What do you smell of?
- What?

782
01:23:16,341 --> 01:23:20,607
Marzipan. I think you've
got marzipan in your hair.

783

No wonder you're homesick.

Is it you?

785
01:23:48,778 --> 01:23:50,211
What?

786
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:53,224
If I said "Moose"...

787
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:56,279
Moose?
Who the hell's Moose?

788
01:23:58,483 --> 01:24:00,542
I look different.

790
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,186
I heard your breathing.

I thought it was the rain.
I'm dying for rain.

792
01:24:15,299 --> 01:24:18,530
Well, I'm dying anyway, but I...

793
01:24:18,603 --> 01:24:21,936
I long for the rain on my face.

794
01:24:23,248 --> 01:24:25,537
First wedding anniversary,
what do you call it?

795
01:24:25,584 --> 01:24:28,567
Ha, I don't know.
Paper?

796
01:24:29,114 --> 01:24:32,413
Is it? I don't know.

797
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:34,481
Paper.

798
01:24:35,132 --> 01:24:36,384
Paper?

799
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:38,615
Darling, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry, something's come up.

800
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:39,573
<i>Oh, no.</i>

801
01:24:39,599 --> 01:24:41,343
Now don't sulk. I'll be
back tomorrow evening.

802
01:24:41,392 --> 01:24:44,384
<i>I'm going to sulk, and I'm not moving
till you get back here.</i>

803
01:24:44,462 --> 01:24:46,320
Promise? That's good.

804
01:24:46,397 --> 01:24:48,831
Okay, my sausage, I love you.

805
01:24:52,726 --> 01:24:54,961
- I didn't know you were going anywhere.
- I'm not.

806
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:59,687
I'm going to surprise her. It's our
anniversary. She's forgotten, of course.

807
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:01,906
What's the symbol of your first
anniversary? I should get something.

808
01:25:01,992 --> 01:25:03,747
Is it cotton or paper?

809
01:25:03,815 --> 01:25:07,952
Your first anniversary? I thought you
two'd been married for donkey's years.

810
01:25:08,054 --> 01:25:11,484
We've been friends for donkey's years.
Best friends.

811
01:25:11,593 --> 01:25:13,514
She was always crying on
my shoulder about somebody.

812
01:25:13,569 --> 01:25:17,219
I finally persuaded her to settle
for my shoulder. A stroke of genius.

813
01:25:20,122 --> 01:25:23,182
- Moose, are you there?
- Yes.

814
01:25:23,235 --> 01:25:27,171
- First anniversary. Is that cotton?
- Uh, is what cotton?

815
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:29,223
First wedding anniversary.

816
01:25:29,287 --> 01:25:32,704
Your first anniversary is... paper.

817
01:25:45,609 --> 01:25:48,417
- Stop.
- Please?

818
01:25:48,493 --> 01:25:50,484
S... Stop here.

819
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:52,992
- Here?
- Just stop right here.

820
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:55,196
Yes, sir.

821
01:26:31,106 --> 01:26:33,438
This...
What is this?

822
01:26:34,872 --> 01:26:37,306
It's a folk song.

823
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:40,435
- Arabic.
- No, no, it's Hungarian.

824
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:44,904
My daijka sang it to me.

825
01:26:45,419 --> 01:26:49,150
When I was a child
growing up in Budapest.

826
01:26:55,726 --> 01:26:57,717
It's beautiful.

827
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:59,956
Hmm.

828
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:02,397
What's it about?

829
01:27:02,466 --> 01:27:04,457
Szerelem means love.

830
01:27:05,101 --> 01:27:07,766
And the story...
Well, there's, um,

831
01:27:07,839 --> 01:27:10,399
this Hungarian count.

832
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:12,465
He's a wanderer.
He's a fool.

833
01:27:13,346 --> 01:27:16,741
And for years he's on
some kind of a quest for...

834
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:19,248
who knows what.

835
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:25,119
And then one day, he falls under
the spell of a mysterious English woman,

836
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:28,657
a harpy, who beats him
and hits him.

837
01:27:28,703 --> 01:27:32,588
And he becomes her slave
and he sews her clothes and worships...

838
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:35,110
Stop!
Stop it!

839
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:37,907
Stop! You're always
beating me.

840
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,426
Bastard.

841
01:27:39,503 --> 01:27:41,801
You bastard!
I believed you!

842
01:27:42,505 --> 01:27:45,906
You should be my slave.

843
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:55,615
I claim this shoulder blade...

844
01:27:55,686 --> 01:27:59,486
No, wait. No, I want...
Turn over.

845
01:27:59,877 --> 01:28:03,550
I want this, this...
this place.

846
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,692
I love this place.
What's it called?

847
01:28:11,948 --> 01:28:14,269
This is mine.

848
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:18,890
I'm going to ask the king permission
to call it the Almásy Bosphorus.

849
01:28:22,017 --> 01:28:25,145
I thought we were
against ownership.

850
01:28:33,795 --> 01:28:36,195
I can stay tonight.

851
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:44,494
Madox knows, I think.

852
01:28:44,568 --> 01:28:47,230
He keeps talking about
Anna Karenina.

853
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:50,866
I think it's his idea
of a man-to-man chat.

854
01:28:50,942 --> 01:28:53,672
Well, it's my idea
of a man-to-man chat.

855
01:28:59,599 --> 01:29:02,966
This is a different world,
is what I tell myself.

856
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:08,324
A different life.

857
01:29:10,061 --> 01:29:13,588
And here I'm a different wife.

858
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:18,792
Yes.

859
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:22,361
Here you are a different wife.

860
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:01,678
Oh, they're darling.
What are they? Thimbles?

861
01:30:01,746 --> 01:30:04,840
Yes, and they're quite old.

862
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:07,042
It's full of saffron.

863
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:10,815
Just in case you think I'm going to give
it to you to encourage your sewing.

864
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,104
I don't care to bargain.

865
01:30:22,503 --> 01:30:25,165
That day, did you follow me
to the market?

866
01:30:25,293 --> 01:30:27,557
Yes, of course.

867
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:36,346
Shall we be all right?

868
01:30:36,522 --> 01:30:38,456
Yes.

869
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:41,150
Yes.

870
01:30:44,051 --> 01:30:45,754
Absolutely.

871
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:47,757
Oh, dear.

- Thought you'd never wake up.
- What?

886
01:31:45,926 --> 01:31:48,622
- Where did you find that?
- I liberated it.

887
01:31:49,044 --> 01:31:53,082
- I think that's called looting.
- No one should own music. The real question is:

888
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,278
- Who wrote the song?
- Irving Berlin.

889
01:31:55,348 --> 01:31:57,145
- For?
- Top Hat.

890
01:31:57,231 --> 01:31:58,390
Is there a song you don't know?

891
01:31:58,462 --> 01:32:01,761
Nope.
He sings all the time.

892
01:32:01,832 --> 01:32:05,563
Good morning. Did you know that?
You're always singing.

893
01:32:05,752 --> 01:32:08,619
I've been told before.

894
01:32:08,751 --> 01:32:12,099
Kip's another one.

895
01:32:17,346 --> 01:32:19,045
"Wang Wang Blues".

896
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,563
You're incredible.

897
01:32:29,724 --> 01:32:31,988
- Good mornin', Miss.
- Hello.

898
01:32:32,122 --> 01:32:34,886
You saved my life.

899
01:32:35,114 --> 01:32:38,675
I haven't forgotten.

900
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,791
I thought you were
very, very tall.

901
01:32:40,838 --> 01:32:45,650
You seemed so big
and... giant.

902
01:32:45,767 --> 01:32:48,338
I felt like a child
who can't keep her balance.

903
01:32:48,407 --> 01:32:52,207
- A toddler.
- A toddler.

904
01:33:15,406 --> 01:33:17,840
My hair was long at some point.

905
01:33:22,022 --> 01:33:25,236
I've forgotten what
a nuisance it is to wash.

906
01:33:28,052 --> 01:33:31,180
Try this. I found
a great jar of it.

907
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,134
Olive oil.

908
01:33:33,202 --> 01:33:35,136
Thank you.

909
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,171
Is this for my hair?

910
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:50,332
Yes, for your hair.

911
01:33:57,448 --> 01:34:00,144
There was a general
who wore a patch...

912
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:03,084
over a perfectly good eye.

913
01:34:04,277 --> 01:34:07,405
The men fought harder for him.

914
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:15,514
Sometimes I think
I could get up and dance.

915
01:34:17,712 --> 01:34:19,873
What's under your mittens?

916
01:34:25,636 --> 01:34:27,661
What's under your mittens?

917
01:34:48,932 --> 01:34:51,366
He's waiting for you.

918
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,448
I'll see you tonight?

919
01:34:54,697 --> 01:34:57,752
Look, Moose, we need you
to stay in Tobruk.

920
01:34:57,827 --> 01:35:02,311
I know it's a bit of a short straw,
but Jerry's got our maps, you know.

921
01:35:02,413 --> 01:35:05,213
And now they're getting
their spies into Cairo using our maps.

922
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:07,944
They'll get Rommel into Cairo
using our maps.

923
01:35:08,018 --> 01:35:11,613
The whole of the desert's like a bloody
bus route, and we gave it to 'em!

924
01:35:11,689 --> 01:35:13,409
Any foreigner who turned up:

925
01:35:13,472 --> 01:35:16,276
"Welcome to the Royal Geographic.
Take our maps."

926
01:35:16,327 --> 01:35:18,261
Old Madox went mad, you know.

927
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:19,917
- Did you know Peter Madox?
- Yeah.

928
01:35:19,979 --> 01:35:22,776
Magnificent explorer.
Thanks, Aicha.

929
01:35:22,823 --> 01:35:25,795
And after he found out
he'd been betrayed by Almásy.

930
01:35:26,737 --> 01:35:28,133
His best friend.

931
01:35:28,205 --> 01:35:30,935
Absolutely destroyed
the poor sot.

932
01:35:50,965 --> 01:35:53,692
Hey, Commandant, stay in line!

933
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:15,568
Hello, little Tommy.
Little baby, hello.

934
01:36:16,387 --> 01:36:18,685
- Recognize him? British friend?
- No.

935
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:27,092
- Get up!
- No!

936
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:28,831
Get up at once!

937
01:36:28,899 --> 01:36:31,834
I don't have a boyfriend.

938
01:36:31,902 --> 01:36:34,462
I don't know anybody!

939
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:36,842
Halt!

940
01:36:36,904 --> 01:36:40,840
No! No!

941
01:36:51,607 --> 01:36:53,075
David Caravaggio.

942
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:54,253
No.

943
01:36:54,443 --> 01:36:56,709
This was taken in Cairo
at British headquarters.

944
01:36:57,279 --> 01:36:59,323
July '41.

945
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:01,523
And so was this.

946
01:37:01,825 --> 01:37:04,999
August '41.
And this.

947
01:37:05,599 --> 01:37:07,036
February '42.

948
01:37:08,317 --> 01:37:09,868
It's possible.

949
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:14,580
I was buying or selling something.
I've been to Cairo many times.

950
01:37:14,650 --> 01:37:17,400
You are a Canadian spy
working for the Allies.

951
01:37:17,436 --> 01:37:20,530
Code name: Moose.

952
01:37:29,328 --> 01:37:32,762
Can you get me a doctor?
I'm sick.

953
01:37:33,845 --> 01:37:36,492
I'm leaking blood!

954
01:37:37,743 --> 01:37:38,696
You want a doctor?

955
01:37:38,751 --> 01:37:40,461
I've been askin' for weeks,
months, I don't know...

956
01:37:40,537 --> 01:37:42,630
We don't have a doctor.

957
01:37:43,557 --> 01:37:44,690
But we do have a nurse.

958
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,406
Sure, great.
A nurse would be great.

959
01:37:49,757 --> 01:37:54,585
Look, give me something.
A name, a code.

960
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,547
So we can all
get out of this room.

961
01:37:58,447 --> 01:38:00,454
I can't think in this heat.

962
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:04,556
- It's too hot.
- I slept with a girl.

963
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:09,058
I've got a wife in Tripoli.

964
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:14,071
A girl comes up and points
at you, you only see trouble.

965
01:38:14,141 --> 01:38:16,308
Fire!

966
01:38:18,112 --> 01:38:20,376
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

967
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,805
This is your nurse, by the way.

968
01:38:23,167 --> 01:38:25,678
She's Muslim, so she'll understand
all of this.

969
01:38:26,538 --> 01:38:29,708
What's the punishment for adultery?
Let's leave it at that.

970
01:38:29,872 --> 01:38:33,330
You're married and you were
fucking another woman, so that's, uh...

971
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,692
Is it the hands that are cut off?

972
01:38:38,056 --> 01:38:40,696
Or is that for stealing?
Does anyone know?

973
01:38:40,751 --> 01:38:43,961
Well, you must know.
You were brought up in Libya, yes?

974
01:38:44,636 --> 01:38:47,104
- Don't cut me.
- Or was it Toronto?

975
01:38:48,475 --> 01:38:49,715
Ten fingers.

976
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,390
How about this?

977
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:54,600
You give me a name for every finger.
It doesn't matter who.

978
01:38:54,655 --> 01:38:57,347
I get something,
you keep something.

979
01:38:57,414 --> 01:38:59,712
- I'm trying to be reasonable.
- Don't cut me. Come on!

980
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:06,964
Are thumbs fingers?

981
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:17,554
- I get no help from these people.
- Telephone.

982
01:39:17,629 --> 01:39:21,871
I'm sick of this room, I'm sick of
this heat and I'm sick of this phone!

983
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,003
Ah! The Geneva Convention!

984
01:39:31,089 --> 01:39:33,914
Hey, come on!
You can't do that!

985
01:39:36,206 --> 01:39:37,511
- Come over here.
- I'll give you names.

986
01:39:37,558 --> 01:39:39,716
- You!
- I'll give you names!

987
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:41,815
- Come on!
- What names did you say?

988
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:46,386
Aaah! Aaah! Let me think!
Just let me think!

989
01:39:46,463 --> 01:39:49,266
I can't think! I know them!
Please, let me think!

990
01:39:49,305 --> 01:39:52,633
I promise!
Oh, please, please, no!

991
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,016
- What name did you say? I knew them!
- Come on!

992
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:58,422
- I can't think of any names! Not my hands! Oh, dear God!
- What are you waiting for?

993
01:39:58,469 --> 01:40:01,702
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, no!

994
01:40:01,778 --> 01:40:04,338
I promise!
Oh, please, not my hands!

995
01:40:04,414 --> 01:40:08,510
No! Jesus!
Jesus! Oh, dear God!

996
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:10,450
- Please don't cut me!
- Come on!

997
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,114
Aaah! No!

998
01:40:13,409 --> 01:40:15,690
Please don't cut!

999
01:40:17,167 --> 01:40:20,328
Don't!

1000
01:40:20,397 --> 01:40:23,992
<i>The man who took my thumbs?</i>

1001
01:40:24,067 --> 01:40:28,060
<i>I found him eventually.
I killed him.</i>

1002
01:40:28,403 --> 01:40:30,770
The man who took my photograph?
I found him too.

1003
01:40:30,888 --> 01:40:35,005
That took me a year.
He's dead.

1004
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:37,037
Another man
showed the Germans...

1005
01:40:37,091 --> 01:40:40,212
a way to get
their spies into Cairo.

1006
01:40:40,478 --> 01:40:43,743
I've been looking for him.

1007
01:40:44,415 --> 01:40:46,384
You can't get through there.
It's impossible.

1008
01:40:46,456 --> 01:40:48,856
I was looking again
at Bell's old maps.

1009
01:40:48,925 --> 01:40:51,052
If we can find a way
through the Wadi,

1010
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,622
we can drive
straight into Cairo.

1011
01:40:53,676 --> 01:40:56,676
- This whole spur is a real possibility.
- So on Thursday,

1012
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:59,973
you don't trust Bell's map, Bell was
a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map.

1013
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:02,469
But on Friday,
he's suddenly infallible.

1014
01:41:02,539 --> 01:41:05,440
- And where are the expedition maps?
- In my room.

1015
01:41:05,766 --> 01:41:07,943
Those maps belong to
His Majesty's Government.

1016
01:41:08,011 --> 01:41:11,688
They shouldn't be left lying around for
any Tom, Dick or Harry to have sight of.

1017
01:41:12,407 --> 01:41:13,829
What on earth's
the matter with you?

1018
01:41:13,915 --> 01:41:16,814
Don't be so bloody naive!
You know there's a war breaking out!

1019
01:41:24,583 --> 01:41:26,122
This arrived this morning.

1020
01:41:26,364 --> 01:41:28,052
"By order of
the British Government,

1021
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:32,479
"all international expeditions
to be aborted by May, 1939."

1022
01:41:36,339 --> 01:41:39,831
What do they care
about our maps?

1023
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:42,378
What do we find in the desert?

1024
01:41:42,446 --> 01:41:45,040
Arrowheads, spears.

1025
01:41:45,503 --> 01:41:48,050
In a war, if you own the desert,
you own North Africa.

1026
01:41:48,118 --> 01:41:50,780
Own the desert? Ha!

1027
01:41:52,011 --> 01:41:55,708
Um, Madox?
That place...

1028
01:41:57,994 --> 01:42:01,157
That place at the base
of a woman's throat.

1029
01:42:03,093 --> 01:42:06,620
You know, the hollow here.

1030
01:42:06,783 --> 01:42:09,081
Does it have an official name?

1031
01:42:10,741 --> 01:42:14,472
For God's sake, man,
pull yourself together.

1032
01:42:25,355 --> 01:42:27,923
<i>Nowhere is there any
wild patriotic excitement,</i>

1033
01:42:27,991 --> 01:42:30,495
<i>but everywhere there is
a deep hatred of war.</i>

1034
01:42:30,589 --> 01:42:32,789
<i>The answer lies with one man,</i>

1035
01:42:32,847 --> 01:42:35,730
<i>and the solid mass of the crowd
surging round his car...</i>

1036
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:40,197
<i>are a symbol that the British people are
more firmly of one mind today...</i>

1037
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:43,501
<i>than at any other time
in our history.</i>

1038
01:42:49,847 --> 01:42:51,886
<i>There's a great to-do
in Sandown Bay,</i>

1039
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:55,623
<i>with rowing and sailing, and
no end of sport for every water baby.</i>

1040
01:42:58,853 --> 01:43:01,219
Sorry.

1041
01:43:04,127 --> 01:43:06,857
I can't... I can't do this.

1042
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,996
I can't do this.
I can't do this anymore.

1043
01:43:42,299 --> 01:43:44,563
I'd better go now.

1044
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,142
Say goodbye here.

1045
01:43:49,201 --> 01:43:53,791
I'm not agreeing. Don't think
I'm agreeing, because I'm not.

1046
01:43:54,049 --> 01:43:55,471
Any minute now, he'll find out.

1047
01:43:55,526 --> 01:43:57,369
We'll barge into someone.
It'll kill him.

1048
01:43:57,447 --> 01:43:59,540
Don't go over it again, please.

1049
01:44:12,575 --> 01:44:13,770
Katharine?

1050
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:19,297
I...

1051
01:44:19,455 --> 01:44:22,549
I just want you to know I'm...

1052
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:25,318
I'm not missing you yet.

1053
01:44:27,903 --> 01:44:29,060
You will.

1054
01:44:30,442 --> 01:44:31,830
You will.

1055
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:07,469
I believe I'm rather late.

1056
01:45:08,289 --> 01:45:10,814
Good.
We're all here.

1057
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:14,850
A toast to the
International Sand Club.

1058
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,325
May it soon resurface.

1059
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:19,294
The International Sand Club.

1060
01:45:19,362 --> 01:45:24,390
The International Sand Club:
misfits, buggers, fascists and fools.

1061
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:27,224
God bless us, every one.
Oops!

1062
01:45:27,457 --> 01:45:31,394
Mustn't say "International".
Dirty word, filthy word.

1063
01:45:31,495 --> 01:45:34,087
His Majesty, die Fuhrer,
il duce...

1064
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:35,712
Sorry.
What's your point?

1065
01:45:36,808 --> 01:45:38,964
And the people here don't want us.
You must be joking.

1066
01:45:39,011 --> 01:45:44,058
The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of
the colonials. Isn't that right, Fouad?

1067
01:45:44,128 --> 01:45:46,932
Some of their best people
getting down on their hands and knees,

1068
01:45:46,978 --> 01:45:49,031
begging to be spared
the Knighthood.

1069
01:45:49,065 --> 01:45:52,216
Isn't that right? Hmm?
Isn't that right, Sir Ronnie?

1070
01:45:53,662 --> 01:45:56,373
What's my point?
Oh, I've invented a new dance.

1071
01:45:56,402 --> 01:45:58,495
Anybody up for it?
It's called...

1072
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:00,928
It's called the Bosphorus Hug.

1073
01:46:02,433 --> 01:46:03,738
Madox?

1074
01:46:03,792 --> 01:46:07,388
Bermann?
You'll dance with me? Hmm?

1075
01:46:08,231 --> 01:46:10,245
D'Ag.
Come on, Daggers.

1076
01:46:10,313 --> 01:46:12,804
Let's eat first.
Sit down.

1077
01:46:15,652 --> 01:46:19,207
♪ We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten ♪

1078
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:22,129
♪ When you're in your bathing suit so thin ♪

1079
01:46:22,191 --> 01:46:24,887
♪ We'll make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin ♪

1080
01:46:24,934 --> 01:46:27,793
They're playing it far too slowly,
but these were the words,

1081
01:46:27,848 --> 01:46:31,463
actually, before
they were cleaned up.

1082
01:46:31,534 --> 01:46:34,628
Might be a song for you,
Mrs. Clif...

1083
01:46:34,704 --> 01:46:37,138
You either shut up or go home!
You're completely blasted!

1084
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,997
- Sit down!
- Absolutely right! Shut up! Shut up!

1085
01:46:40,696 --> 01:46:44,047
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:46:44,081 --> 01:46:46,777
I can't think what came over me.

1087
01:46:47,654 --> 01:46:50,342
Lashings of apologies...

1088
01:46:50,505 --> 01:46:52,700
all around.

1089
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:26,897
Thank you.

1090
01:47:36,863 --> 01:47:40,128
- Why were you holding his collar?
- What?

1091
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:43,956
"What"? That boy.
That little boy.

1092
01:47:43,995 --> 01:47:47,050
You were holding his collar.
You were gripping his collar. What for?

1093
01:47:47,152 --> 01:47:49,244
Hmm? Is he next?

1094
01:47:49,405 --> 01:47:52,402
Are you going to drag him
into your little room? Where is it?

1095
01:47:52,542 --> 01:47:53,948
Is this it?

1096
01:47:54,017 --> 01:47:56,073
- Don't do this.
- I've watched you.

1097
01:47:56,149 --> 01:47:58,515
I've watched you
at garden parties,

1098
01:47:58,647 --> 01:48:00,911
on verandas, at the races.

1099
01:48:01,124 --> 01:48:05,083
- How can you... stand there?
- Please.

1100
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:08,028
How can you ever smile,

1101
01:48:08,098 --> 01:48:12,125
as if your life hadn't capsized?

1102
01:48:13,803 --> 01:48:16,271
You know why?

1103
01:48:19,031 --> 01:48:21,022
Dance with me.

1104
01:48:21,945 --> 01:48:24,345
No.

1105
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:27,539
Dance with me.

1106
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:30,595
I want to touch you.

1107
01:48:30,632 --> 01:48:34,568
I want the things which are mine,
which belong to me.

1108
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,252
Do you think you're the
only one who feels anything?

1109
01:48:41,331 --> 01:48:44,300
Is that what you think?

1110
01:49:03,501 --> 01:49:06,527
Why don't you go?

1111
01:49:06,651 --> 01:49:10,314
- Get some sleep.
- Would you like me to?

1112
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,793
Good night.

1113
01:50:24,565 --> 01:50:26,499
Hana.

1114
01:50:31,174 --> 01:50:33,472
Kip.

1115
01:51:07,581 --> 01:51:10,812
Just wait.
Don't look at anything yet.

1116
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:35,415
Wait.

1117
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:54,143
Kip!

1118
01:53:14,874 --> 01:53:17,206
Oh, thank you!

1119
01:53:18,295 --> 01:53:20,408
Mmm!

1120
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,959
If one night I didn't come
to see you,

1121
01:53:39,348 --> 01:53:41,908
what would you do?

1122
01:53:42,062 --> 01:53:44,895
I try not to expect you.

1123
01:53:47,682 --> 01:53:51,743
Yes, but if it got late and...

1124
01:53:51,819 --> 01:53:54,447
I hadn't shown up?

1125
01:53:56,015 --> 01:53:59,382
Then I'd think
there must be a reason.

1126
01:54:00,394 --> 01:54:02,828
You wouldn't come to find me?

1127
01:54:05,165 --> 01:54:08,726
Hmm. That makes me
never want to come here.

1128
01:54:13,607 --> 01:54:15,871
Then I'd tell myself,

1129
01:54:15,943 --> 01:54:19,208
he spends all day searching.

1130
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:22,214
In the night,
he wants to be found.

1131
01:54:27,621 --> 01:54:30,556
I do. I do want you
to find me.

1132
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:34,059
I do want to be found.

1133
01:54:51,578 --> 01:54:54,172
I was looking for
Lieutenant Singh.

1134
01:54:54,248 --> 01:54:58,309
- He's sleeping.
- Only we've got to go to work.

1135
01:54:58,385 --> 01:55:00,853
I'll tell him.

1136
01:55:02,055 --> 01:55:04,649
What is it?
Is it a mine?

1137
01:55:04,725 --> 01:55:07,455
It's a bomb by a viaduct.

1138
01:55:08,762 --> 01:55:11,424
- Does he have to go?
- Beg pardon?

1139
01:55:11,498 --> 01:55:15,434
What if you couldn't find him?
Sergeant, not today. Not this morning.

1140
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:20,094
- What's happening? Am I needed?
- Afraid so, sir.

1141
01:55:21,853 --> 01:55:23,601
Don't go.
I'm frightened.

1142
01:55:24,946 --> 01:55:26,646
This is what I do.

1143
01:55:26,713 --> 01:55:29,705
I do this every day.

1144
01:55:49,233 --> 01:55:50,334
Hardy!

1145
01:55:50,389 --> 01:55:53,934
Serial number K-K-I-P...

1146
01:55:54,787 --> 01:55:56,805
2-6-0-0.

1147
01:55:56,877 --> 01:55:59,869
K-K-I-P 2600, sir!

1148
01:56:00,102 --> 01:56:02,593
I'll get the oxygen.

1149
01:57:00,779 --> 01:57:02,186
Hardy, what's happening?

1150
01:57:02,256 --> 01:57:05,225
Can't see, sir!
It's from the road!

1151
01:57:06,346 --> 01:57:09,645
Corporal?

1152
01:57:10,755 --> 01:57:13,117
Tanks, sir!
I don't know what it's about!

1153
01:57:13,186 --> 01:57:16,121
- Stop 'em!
- Stop!

1154
01:57:18,095 --> 01:57:18,782
Stop!

1155
01:57:18,821 --> 01:57:22,026
- Hardy!
- Stop! Stop!

1156
01:57:22,095 --> 01:57:24,188
What is this, a bloody carnival?

1157
01:57:24,264 --> 01:57:26,289
The fuse has snapped!

1158
01:57:26,366 --> 01:57:30,200
What's happened? Is it armed?

1159
01:57:32,535 --> 01:57:33,637
Hang on a second.

1160
01:57:33,707 --> 01:57:35,572
I'll be right with you.

1161
01:57:36,105 --> 01:57:38,743
Can you see the detonator, sir?

1162
01:57:40,149 --> 01:57:42,982
You've got to cut it, sir.
That frost won't last.

1163
01:57:43,425 --> 01:57:46,252
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

1164
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:53,858
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

1165
01:57:53,927 --> 01:57:56,691
- Go away!
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:57:57,222 --> 01:58:00,529
- This is making me incredibly angry.
- I know, sir.

1167
01:58:02,084 --> 01:58:04,343
- Watch out! That'll burn!
- Ow!

1168
01:58:12,109 --> 01:58:13,664
Can you feel 'em?

1169
01:58:23,104 --> 01:58:25,291
Cut it, sir.

1170
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:28,221
- You've gotta cut it!
- I don't even know if this is the right wire.

1171
01:58:28,283 --> 01:58:31,523
Choose. Just choose a loop
and cut it.

1172
01:58:54,169 --> 01:58:57,427
Get a blanket! Spaulding, get a blanket
for Lieutenant!

1173
01:58:57,466 --> 01:59:00,918
Sarge! Sarge!
It's over, sir! It's over!

1174
01:59:00,994 --> 01:59:03,986
- Jerry's surrendered!
- Yeah-ha!

1175
01:59:10,173 --> 01:59:12,107
Sir, congratulations.

1176
01:59:12,773 --> 01:59:17,904

- Later.
- Oh, come on.

1193
02:00:37,911 --> 02:00:39,222
Clap now.

1194
02:00:40,254 --> 02:00:41,487
Yeah.

1195
02:00:57,677 --> 02:01:00,737
Come on, Sarge!
Let's raise that flag!

1196
02:01:00,814 --> 02:01:03,180
Hardy's coming!

1197
02:01:03,856 --> 02:01:06,290
Here comes the bomb squad!

1198
02:01:13,654 --> 02:01:15,349
Hey, where's my helmet?

1199
02:01:15,372 --> 02:01:18,432
Go on, Sergeant Hardy!

1200
02:01:28,127 --> 02:01:30,105
Bring 'em home!

1201
02:01:30,347 --> 02:01:32,906
Hardy! Hardy! Hardy!

1202
02:01:37,667 --> 02:01:39,488
What was that?

1203
02:01:44,891 --> 02:01:47,325
I'm never going
to forgive myself.

1204
02:01:47,394 --> 02:01:49,919
I'm never going
to bloody forgive myself.

1205
02:01:53,266 --> 02:01:56,497
Sergeant Hardy, sir.
It was booby-trapped.

1206
02:01:56,570 --> 02:02:00,413
They was runnin' up the Union Jack, sir,
up on that statue.

1207
02:02:00,499 --> 02:02:03,604
It just went off, sir.

1208
02:02:03,677 --> 02:02:07,078
Sergeant Hardy climbed up,
Sir, just for a lark, sir.

1209
02:02:07,147 --> 02:02:09,206
It should've been me.
It was my idea.

1210
02:02:09,282 --> 02:02:12,882
- Sir, you don't wanna look.
- Ooh.

1211
02:02:13,031 --> 02:02:14,611
Who's that girl?

1212
02:02:14,688 --> 02:02:17,486
His fiancée, sir.

1213
02:02:17,557 --> 02:02:21,755
- Hardy's?
- He kept it a bit dark.

1214
02:02:29,869 --> 02:02:31,803
Kip?

1215
02:02:32,872 --> 02:02:35,170
Kip, it's me.

1216
02:02:36,454 --> 02:02:39,389
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

1217
02:02:40,647 --> 02:02:43,775
Can I talk to you?
Kip?

1218
02:02:45,552 --> 02:02:48,487
Kip, why won't you talk to me?

1219
02:02:51,691 --> 02:02:53,955
Oh, Kip.

1220
02:02:57,964 --> 02:03:00,398
Oh, let me come in!

1221
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:30,059
Hana tells me you're leaving.

1222
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:32,564
There's going to be trials.

1223
02:03:32,632 --> 02:03:34,896
They want me to interpret.

1224
02:03:34,968 --> 02:03:37,835
Don't they know
I'm allergic to courtrooms?

1225
02:03:42,342 --> 02:03:44,276
So...

1226
02:03:46,423 --> 02:03:48,687
I come across
the hospital convoy.

1227
02:03:49,381 --> 02:03:51,407
They're looking for this stuff.

1228
02:03:51,484 --> 02:03:53,850
This nurse, Mary,

1229
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,354
tells me about you and Hana...

1230
02:03:56,423 --> 02:03:58,571
hiding in some monastery in...

1231
02:03:58,636 --> 02:04:01,867
What do you call it?
Retreat?

1232
02:04:02,228 --> 02:04:04,628
How you came
out of the desert...

1233
02:04:04,698 --> 02:04:08,964
and you were burned
and you didn't remember your name,

1234
02:04:09,035 --> 02:04:11,629
but you knew the words
to every song that ever was...

1235
02:04:11,705 --> 02:04:15,607
and you had one possession:
a copy of Herodotus.

1236
02:04:16,807 --> 02:04:18,432
And it was filled...

1237
02:04:18,451 --> 02:04:20,715
with letters and cuttings.

1238
02:04:21,781 --> 02:04:24,215
Then I knew it was you.

1239
02:04:28,228 --> 02:04:29,447
Me?

1240
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:42,770
I saw you...

1241
02:04:42,811 --> 02:04:47,771
writing in that book
at the embassy in Cairo...

1242
02:04:48,541 --> 02:04:52,500
when I had thumbs
and you had a face...

1243
02:04:52,579 --> 02:04:54,570
and a name.

1244
02:04:54,647 --> 02:04:56,581
I see.

1245
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,773
Before you went
over to the Germans,

1246
02:04:59,806 --> 02:05:05,023
before you found a way to get Rommel's spy across
the desert and inside British headquarters.

1247
02:05:05,749 --> 02:05:07,456
He took some
pretty good photographs.

1248
02:05:07,527 --> 02:05:10,928
I saw mine in that
torture room in Tobruk.

1249
02:05:10,997 --> 02:05:15,331
So, it made an impression.

1250
02:05:15,401 --> 02:05:19,838
I had to get back to the desert.
I'd made a promise.

1251
02:05:19,906 --> 02:05:21,999
The rest meant nothing to me.

1252
02:05:22,285 --> 02:05:24,566
What did you say?

1253
02:05:24,644 --> 02:05:28,136
That the rest...
meant nothing to me.

1254
02:05:28,214 --> 02:05:30,774
There was a result
to what you did.

1255
02:05:30,850 --> 02:05:35,118
It wasn't just another expedition.
It did this.

1256
02:05:35,297 --> 02:05:37,423
If the British hadn't
unearthed that photographer,

1257
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:39,583
thousands of people
could have died.

1258
02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:43,585
Thousands of people did die.
Just different people.

1259
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:47,155
- Yes, like Madox.
- What?

1260
02:05:47,264 --> 02:05:50,332
You know he shot himself,
your partner,

1261
02:05:50,403 --> 02:05:52,997
- when he found out you were a spy.
- What?

1262
02:05:54,806 --> 02:05:55,744
Hold...

1263
02:05:56,493 --> 02:05:59,871
Madox thought
I was a spy? No.

1264
02:06:00,477 --> 02:06:03,143
<i>No, I was never a spy.</i>

1265
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:05,776
It's ghastly.
It's like a witch hunt.

1266
02:06:05,852 --> 02:06:08,286
Anybody remotely foreign
is suddenly a spy.

1267
02:06:08,354 --> 02:06:10,845
- So watch out.
- Right.

1268
02:06:11,341 --> 02:06:14,257
We didn't care about
countries, did we?

1269
02:06:14,327 --> 02:06:16,925
Brits, Arabs,
Hungarians, Germans...

1270
02:06:17,027 --> 02:06:19,980
None of that mattered, did it?
It was something finer than that.

1271
02:06:20,894 --> 02:06:22,940
Yes, it was.

1272
02:06:24,737 --> 02:06:27,005
I'll leave the plane
in Kufra oasis.

1273
02:06:27,252 --> 02:06:29,612
- So, if you need it...
- Right.

1274
02:06:29,648 --> 02:06:32,124
Hard to know
how long one's talking about.

1275
02:06:32,187 --> 02:06:36,093
We might all be back
in a month or two.

1276
02:06:39,419 --> 02:06:41,387
Hmm.

1277
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:49,687
I have to teach myself not to
read too much into everything.

1278
02:06:49,926 --> 02:06:53,453
It comes of too long having to read
so much into hardly anything at all.

1279
02:06:59,173 --> 02:07:02,069
Good-bye, my friend.

1280
02:07:07,687 --> 02:07:09,746
There is no God.

1281
02:07:11,125 --> 02:07:12,981
But I hope someone
looks after you.

1282
02:07:14,821 --> 02:07:18,279
In case you're still wondering,

1283
02:07:18,358 --> 02:07:21,384
this is called
a suprasternal notch.

1284
02:07:25,298 --> 02:07:28,790
Come and visit us in Dorset
when all this nonsense is over.

1285
02:07:34,741 --> 02:07:36,936
You'll never come to Dorset.

1286
02:07:46,661 --> 02:07:50,427
<i>So, you didn't know
Madox shot himself.</i>

1287
02:07:54,313 --> 02:07:55,992
No.

1288
02:07:56,097 --> 02:07:58,793
And you didn't kill
the Cliftons?

1289
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,639
She...

1290
02:08:14,661 --> 02:08:16,595
She...

1291
02:08:19,598 --> 02:08:22,319
She die...

1292
02:08:23,169 --> 02:08:24,379
She...
I can't.

1293
02:08:28,394 --> 02:08:30,328
Well,

1294
02:08:32,128 --> 02:08:34,125
maybe I did.

1295
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:41,001
Maybe I did.

1296
02:08:47,447 --> 02:08:50,245
<i>I was packing up
our base camp...</i>

1297
02:08:50,308 --> 02:08:52,845
<i>at the Cave of Swimmers.</i>

1298
02:08:52,923 --> 02:08:57,783
<i>Clifton had offered to fly down
from Cairo to collect me.</i>

1299
02:08:57,857 --> 02:09:00,883
<i>He flew like a madman always,</i>

1300
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:03,520
<i>so I...
I took no notice.</i>

1301
02:09:39,321 --> 02:09:42,091
Katharine?

1302
02:09:42,168 --> 02:09:46,002
Dear God, Katharine,
what are you doing here?

1303
02:09:46,072 --> 02:09:49,508
I can't get out.
I can't move.

1304
02:09:53,046 --> 02:09:55,514
"Surprise", he said.

1305
02:09:56,916 --> 02:09:59,578
Poor Geoffrey.

1306
02:09:59,652 --> 02:10:04,385
He knew. He must've
known all the time.

1307
02:10:04,457 --> 02:10:07,893
He was shouting, "I love you, Katharine.
I love you so much."

1308
02:10:10,363 --> 02:10:12,797
Is he badly hurt?

1309
02:10:14,434 --> 02:10:16,561
I have to get you out.

1310
02:10:16,636 --> 02:10:19,070
- Please don't move me.
- I have to get you out.

1311
02:10:19,138 --> 02:10:22,904
- It hurts too much.
- I know, darling, I know. I'm sorry.

1312
02:10:22,975 --> 02:10:24,909
Come on.

1313
02:10:27,685 --> 02:10:29,076
Now!

1314
02:10:46,666 --> 02:10:48,998
Why did you hate me?

1315
02:10:49,068 --> 02:10:51,002
What?

1316
02:10:53,642 --> 02:10:56,134
Don't you know
you drove everybody mad?

1317
02:10:56,209 --> 02:10:59,701
Shh. Don't talk.

1318
02:10:59,958 --> 02:11:01,896
You speak so many
bloody languages...

1319
02:11:01,950 --> 02:11:04,582
and you never want to talk.

1320
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:13,989
- You're wearing the thimble.
- Of course.

1321
02:11:14,767 --> 02:11:16,510
You idiot.

1322
02:11:16,632 --> 02:11:20,295
I always wear it.
I've always worn it.

1323
02:11:20,425 --> 02:11:22,859
I've always loved you.

1324
02:11:59,018 --> 02:12:00,595
It's so cold.

1325
02:12:00,673 --> 02:12:03,198
I know. I'm sorry.

1326
02:12:05,478 --> 02:12:07,912
I'll make a fire.

1327
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:14,985
Did you get Geoffrey
out of the plane?

1328
02:12:15,054 --> 02:12:17,955
- Yes, I did.
- Good. That's good. Thank you.

1329
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:26,004
Listen to me, Katharine.

1330
02:12:26,232 --> 02:12:27,622
You've broken your ankle...

1331
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:30,225
and I'm going to have
to try and bind it.

1332
02:12:30,303 --> 02:12:32,863
I think you've also
broken your wrist...

1333
02:12:32,939 --> 02:12:36,534
and maybe some ribs, which is why
it's hurting you to breathe.

1334
02:12:36,609 --> 02:12:39,203
I'm going to have to
walk to El Taj.

1335
02:12:39,793 --> 02:12:43,112
Although, given all the traffic
in the desert these days,

1336
02:12:43,182 --> 02:12:46,811
I'm bound to bump into
one army or another.

1337
02:12:47,081 --> 02:12:50,517
And then I'll come back
and you'll be fine.

1338
02:12:51,198 --> 02:12:52,448
You promise?

1339
02:12:53,956 --> 02:12:55,619
I wouldn't want to die here.

1340
02:12:56,796 --> 02:12:59,264
I don't want to die
in the desert.

1341
02:13:03,338 --> 02:13:06,273
I've always had a rather
elaborate funeral in mind.

1342
02:13:07,907 --> 02:13:09,931
Particular hymns.

1343
02:13:09,999 --> 02:13:12,934
And I know exactly
where I want to be buried.

1344
02:13:14,747 --> 02:13:18,444
In our garden,
where I grew up...

1345
02:13:18,517 --> 02:13:21,577
with a view of the sea.

1346
02:13:21,654 --> 02:13:24,452
So promise me
you'll come back for me.

1347
02:13:25,233 --> 02:13:27,151
I promise...

1348
02:13:27,226 --> 02:13:29,490
I'll come back for you.

1349
02:13:30,896 --> 02:13:33,763
I promise...

1350
02:13:33,833 --> 02:13:37,132
I'll never leave you.

1351
02:13:40,924 --> 02:13:43,197
You have plenty of water...

1352
02:13:43,276 --> 02:13:45,437
and, um, food.

1353
02:13:47,026 --> 02:13:49,114
I'll open them for you.

1354
02:13:54,036 --> 02:13:56,061
A good read.

1355
02:13:59,625 --> 02:14:01,650
Don't waste this.

1356
02:14:06,181 --> 02:14:08,352
Will you bury Geoffrey?

1357
02:14:12,571 --> 02:14:14,698
I know he's dead.

1358
02:14:18,065 --> 02:14:20,329
I'm sorry, Katharine.

1359
02:14:21,547 --> 02:14:23,481
I know.

1360
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:33,921
Every night...

1361
02:14:33,993 --> 02:14:36,359
I cut out my heart.

1362
02:14:41,467 --> 02:14:43,616
But in the morning
it was full again.

1363
02:14:51,334 --> 02:14:53,268
Darling.

1364
02:14:54,545 --> 02:14:56,536

and at twilight.</i>

1374
02:15:49,635 --> 02:15:54,095
<i>Three days there on foot,
I told her,</i>

1375
02:15:54,289 --> 02:15:58,225
<i>and three hours back by car.</i>

1376

<i>Don't go anywhere.</i>

<i>I'll be back.</i>

<i>I'll be back.</i>

1379
02:16:27,807 --> 02:16:30,105
Just walked in
from the desert, sir.

1380
02:16:31,343 --> 02:16:33,743
Morning.

1381
02:16:46,492 --> 02:16:49,552
Dear golly, where have
you come from then?

1382
02:16:51,062 --> 02:16:52,995
There's been an accident.

1383
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:55,625
I need a doctor...

1384
02:16:55,701 --> 02:16:59,034
to come with me,
and I need to borrow this car.

1385
02:16:59,338 --> 02:17:00,247
I'll pay, of course.

1386
02:17:00,294 --> 02:17:05,008
- And I need... I need morphine.
- May I see your papers, sir?

1387
02:17:06,254 --> 02:17:07,272
What?

1388
02:17:07,346 --> 02:17:10,679
If I could just see
some form of identification.

1389
02:17:10,749 --> 02:17:14,241
I'm sorry, I'm not making sense.
Forgive me, I... I'm not...

1390
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:16,811
I've been walking and...

1391
02:17:16,889 --> 02:17:21,758
A woman is badly injured
at the Gilf Kabir, the Cave of Swimmers.

1392
02:17:21,827 --> 02:17:24,523
I'm a member of the
Royal Geographical Society.

1393
02:17:24,597 --> 02:17:27,259
Right.

1394
02:17:27,333 --> 02:17:30,769
Now, if I could...
just take your name.

1395
02:17:33,772 --> 02:17:38,436
Count László de Almásy.

1396
02:17:40,679 --> 02:17:44,473
"Almásy". Would you mind
spelling that for me?

1397
02:17:44,543 --> 02:17:48,014
- Look, listen to me, will you?
- What nationality would that be?

1398
02:17:48,087 --> 02:17:52,285
A woman is dying.
My wife is dying.

1399
02:17:52,358 --> 02:17:56,556
I have been... walking...

1400
02:17:57,930 --> 02:18:00,524
I have been walking
for three days.

1401
02:18:00,599 --> 02:18:03,067
I do not want to spell my name.

1402
02:18:03,135 --> 02:18:06,366
- I want you to give me this car.
- I understand you're agitated.

1403
02:18:06,438 --> 02:18:09,601
Perhaps if you'd like to sit down,
I can radio back to H.Q.

1404
02:18:09,675 --> 02:18:14,635
No. No, don't...
Don't radio anybody!

1405
02:18:14,713 --> 02:18:17,944
Just give me the fucking car!

1406
02:19:18,488 --> 02:19:22,206
Stop the car, please.
A woman is dying!

1407
02:19:22,238 --> 02:19:24,339
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen
to another word from you,

1408
02:19:24,417 --> 02:19:26,472
I'm going to give you
a fucking good hiding!

1409
02:19:26,535 --> 02:19:29,479
Fritz? What are you
talking about, Fritz?

1410
02:19:29,555 --> 02:19:30,988
Well, that's your name,
isn't it?

1411
02:19:31,056 --> 02:19:33,047
Count Fuckin' Asshole
Von Bismarck!

1412
02:19:33,125 --> 02:19:35,855
- What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
- Please!

1413
02:19:35,919 --> 02:19:39,855
You have to listen!
Katharine!

1414
02:19:40,283 --> 02:19:43,013
<i>Katharine!</i>

1415
02:19:56,163 --> 02:19:57,640
Excuse me.

1416
02:19:57,694 --> 02:20:00,582
- I also need to use the lavatory.
- You'll have to wait.

1417
02:20:00,629 --> 02:20:04,586
- It's urgent.
- Sarge!

1418
02:20:05,121 --> 02:20:07,820
Sarge, Jerry wants
to use the lav.

1419
02:20:07,885 --> 02:20:10,217
Says it's urgent.

1420
02:20:12,297 --> 02:20:15,733
- Where are we going, please?
- Oh, up north to the coast.

1421
02:20:15,801 --> 02:20:18,269
Benghazi.
Soon be there.

1422
02:20:18,704 --> 02:20:20,729
You can get your boat
back home then.

1423
02:20:21,516 --> 02:20:24,899
All right, go on then.
Here, you take him.

1424
02:20:24,977 --> 02:20:28,378
I've been up and down
this bloody train all day.

1425
02:20:43,595 --> 02:20:45,688
It doesn't open.

1426
02:21:56,173 --> 02:21:57,761
<i>So yes,</i>

1427
02:21:59,271 --> 02:22:02,365
she died because of me.

1428
02:22:05,177 --> 02:22:07,441
Because I loved her.

1429
02:22:11,150 --> 02:22:13,414
Because I...

1430
02:22:16,421 --> 02:22:19,015
Because I had the wrong name.

1431
02:22:28,334 --> 02:22:33,209
- And you never got back to the cave?
- I did get back.

1432
02:22:33,379 --> 02:22:36,246
I kept my promise.

1433
02:22:37,442 --> 02:22:40,741
<i>I was assisted by the Germans.</i>

1434
02:22:40,813 --> 02:22:43,179
<i>There was a... a trade.</i>

1435
02:22:43,248 --> 02:22:46,649
<i>I had our expedition maps.</i>

1436
02:22:46,718 --> 02:22:49,812
<i>And after the British
made me their enemy,</i>

1437
02:22:49,888 --> 02:22:53,790
<i>I gave their enemy our maps.</i>

1438
02:23:06,205 --> 02:23:08,833
<i>So I got back to the desert...</i>

1439
02:23:08,907 --> 02:23:11,375
<i>and to Katharine...</i>

1440
02:23:11,443 --> 02:23:13,603
<i>in Madox's English plane...</i>

1441
02:23:13,673 --> 02:23:16,196
<i>with German gasoline.</i>

1442
02:23:20,719 --> 02:23:23,414
When I arrived in Italy,

1443
02:23:23,455 --> 02:23:26,151
on my medical chart they wrote,

1444
02:23:26,414 --> 02:23:29,023
"English Patient".

1445
02:23:29,094 --> 02:23:31,790
Isn't that funny?

1446
02:23:31,864 --> 02:23:35,265
After all that,
I became English.

1447
02:23:38,737 --> 02:23:42,764
You get to the morning and the
poison leaks away, doesn't it?

1448
02:23:46,345 --> 02:23:48,609
Black nights.

1449
02:23:52,684 --> 02:23:55,949
- I thought I would kill you.
- You can't kill me.

1450
02:23:57,322 --> 02:23:59,586
I died years ago.

1451
02:24:03,562 --> 02:24:06,224
No, I can't kill you now.

1452
02:24:25,384 --> 02:24:28,512
We've been posted.
North of Florence.

1453
02:24:35,399 --> 02:24:38,429
I was thinking yesterday...

1454
02:24:38,497 --> 02:24:41,022
yesterday...

1455
02:24:41,099 --> 02:24:43,567
The patient and Hardy.

1456
02:24:43,635 --> 02:24:45,967
They're everything
that's good about England.

1457
02:24:47,701 --> 02:24:50,169
I couldn't even say
what that was.

1458
02:24:52,435 --> 02:24:55,606
We didn't exchange
two personal words,

1459
02:24:55,681 --> 02:24:58,343
and we've been together
through some terrible things.

1460
02:24:58,635 --> 02:25:00,783
Some terrible things.

1461
02:25:01,729 --> 02:25:04,982
He was engaged
to a girl in the village.

1462
02:25:05,057 --> 02:25:07,651
I mean...

1463
02:25:07,726 --> 02:25:11,890
And us, he never once...

1464
02:25:11,964 --> 02:25:17,368
He didn't ask me if I could spin
the ball at cricket or Kamasutra or...

1465
02:25:30,716 --> 02:25:33,344
I don't even know
what I'm talking about.

1466
02:25:34,325 --> 02:25:36,353
You loved him.

1467
02:27:00,535 --> 02:27:02,503
Katharine.

1468
02:27:15,587 --> 02:27:18,215
I'm still here.

1469
02:27:19,658 --> 02:27:22,286
You'd better be.

1470
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:25,158
Don't depend on it, will you?

1471
02:27:26,465 --> 02:27:29,832
That little bit of air
in my lungs,

1472
02:27:29,901 --> 02:27:33,598
each day it gets less and less.

1473
02:27:35,073 --> 02:27:37,405
Which is all right.

1474
02:27:37,476 --> 02:27:39,910
It's quite all right.

1475
02:27:42,013 --> 02:27:45,380
I've been speaking
to Caravaggio,

1476
02:27:45,450 --> 02:27:48,385
my research assistant.

1477
02:27:48,453 --> 02:27:51,980
He tells me there's a ghost
in the cloisters.

1478
02:27:53,388 --> 02:27:55,913
I can join him.

1479
02:27:58,029 --> 02:28:00,759
- Hana!
- It's the boy.

1480
02:28:25,435 --> 02:28:27,869
I'll always
go back to that church.

1481
02:28:28,426 --> 02:28:31,054
Look at my paintings.

1482
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:37,500
I'll always
go back to that church.

1483
02:28:39,538 --> 02:28:42,871
So one day we'll meet.

1484
02:30:33,619 --> 02:30:35,104
Thank you.

1485
02:30:46,426 --> 02:30:48,690
Read to me, will you?

1486
02:30:54,506 --> 02:30:56,940
Read me to sleep.

1487
02:31:19,964 --> 02:31:22,626
<i>"My darling,</i>

1488
02:31:22,701 --> 02:31:25,465
<i>"I'm waiting for you.</i>

1489
02:31:25,537 --> 02:31:28,836
<i>"How long is a day in the dark?</i>

1490
02:31:29,414 --> 02:31:31,678
"Or a week?

1491
02:31:39,617 --> 02:31:42,017
"The fire is gone now...

1492
02:31:42,087 --> 02:31:45,079
"and I'm horr..."
"horribly cold."

1493
02:31:46,958 --> 02:31:48,903
<i>I really ought
to drag myself outside,</i>

1494
02:31:48,942 --> 02:31:51,604
<i>but then there'd be the sun.</i>

1495
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:54,600
<i>I'm afraid I waste the light...</i>

1496
02:31:54,662 --> 02:31:57,927
<i>on the paintings
and on writing these words.</i>

1497
02:32:01,406 --> 02:32:03,306
<i>We die.</i>

1498
02:32:03,937 --> 02:32:05,536
"We die.

1499
02:32:05,610 --> 02:32:09,410
"We die rich with lovers and tribes,

"bodies we have entered...

1502
02:32:15,988 --> 02:32:17,984
"and swum up like rivers."

1503
02:32:19,079 --> 02:32:21,423
<i>Fears we've hidden in,</i>

1504
02:32:21,719 --> 02:32:23,983
<i>like this wretched cave.</i>

1505
02:32:29,734 --> 02:32:32,328
<i>I want all this
marked on my body.</i>

1506
02:32:34,672 --> 02:32:37,427
<i>We're the real countries.</i>

1507
02:32:37,490 --> 02:32:40,234
<i>Not the boundaries
drawn on maps,</i>

1508
02:32:40,592 --> 02:32:43,186
<i>the names of powerful men.</i>

1509
02:32:53,758 --> 02:32:57,694
<i>I know you'll come and carry me
out into the palace of winds.</i>

1510
02:33:05,603 --> 02:33:08,572
<i>That's all I've wanted,</i>

1511
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:12,576
<i>to walk in such
a place with you,</i>

1512
02:33:12,644 --> 02:33:15,545
<i>with friends.</i>

1513
02:33:15,613 --> 02:33:18,047
<i>An Earth without maps.</i>

1514
02:33:23,421 --> 02:33:26,185
"The lamp's gone out,

1515

"in the darkness."

1517
02:34:34,963 --> 02:34:37,454
Hana?

1518
02:34:37,529 --> 02:34:39,963
Hana, come on!

1519
02:34:42,260 --> 02:34:44,031
Hana,

1520
02:34:46,168 --> 02:34:47,571
this is Gioia.

1521
02:34:47,597 --> 02:34:49,629
- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno.

1522
02:34:50,675 --> 02:34:52,449
She'll take you
as far as Florence.

1523
02:34:52,494 --> 02:34:54,758
I can get in back.

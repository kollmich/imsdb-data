- Hello?
- Hello.- Yes?
- Who is this?- Who you trying to reach?
- What number is this?- What number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.- I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?It happens. Take it easy.- Hello!
- I'm sorry. I guess
I dialed the wrong number.- So, why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.- You're forgiven. Bye, now.
- Wait, wait! Don't hang up.- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.They've got 900-numbers
for that. See ya.- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.- I don't think so.- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.I only eat popcorn
at the movies.- Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.
- Really? What?Oh, just some scary movie.- You like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.What's your favorite
scary movie?- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favorite.What comes to mind?Um..."Halloween."You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask...who walks around
and stalks baby-sitters.- Yeah.
- What's yours?- Guess.
- Um..."Nightmare on Elm Street."Is that the one where
the guy had knives for fingers?- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
- Freddy, that's right.I liked that movie.
It was scary.Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.So, you got a boyfriend?Why? You wanna ask me
out on a date?Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?- Mm... no.
- You never told me your name.Why do you want
to know my name?'Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.- What did you say?
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?What?Hello?Look, I gotta go.Wait! I thought we
were gonna go out.Uh, nah, I don't think so.Don't hang up on me!Shit.- Yes?
- I told you not to hang up on me.- What do you want?
- To talk.Well, dial someone else, okay?- Listen, asshole!
- No, you listen, you little bitch!You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?Yeah.Is this some kind of joke?More of a game, really.Can you handle that...blondie?Can you see me?Listen, I am two seconds away
from calling the police.They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.Who's there?
Who's there?- I'm calling the police.You should never say,
"Who's there?"Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.You might as well just
come out here to investigate
a strange noise or somethin'.Look, you've had
your fun now...- so I think you better
just leave or else.
- Or else what?Or else my boyfriend'll
be here any second, and he'll
be pissed when he finds out.I thought you didn't
have a boyfriend.I lied! I do have a boyfriend,
and he'll be here any second...- so your ass better be gone.
- Sure.I swear.He's big, and he plays football
and he'll kick the shit out of you!I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.So you better just leave.His name wouldn't be...Steve, would it?How do you know his name?Turn on the patio lights... again.Oh, God!- I wouldn't
do that if I were you.
- Where are you?- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?- I wanna play a game.
- No.- Then he dies right now!
- No! No!Which is it?
Which is it?Wha... What kind of game?Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.Just do it!Casey! No! No!No! Casey!Here's how we play.I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.- Please don't do this.
- Come on. It'll be fun.- Please...
- It's an easy category.- Please...
- Movie trivia.- I'll even give you
a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.Come on! It's your favorite
scary movie, remember?- He had a white mask;
he stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.- What's his name?
- I can't think.Steve's counting on you.Michael...
Michael, Michael.Yes! Very good.Now for the real question.- No!
- But you're doing so well.- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!Answer the question.
Same category.Oh, please stop.Name the killer
in "Friday the 13th."Jason! Jason, Jason!I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.No, it's not! No, it's not.
It was Jason.Afraid not. No way.Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees, was the original killer.Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.You tricked me.Lucky for you
there's a bonus round.But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!Hey, we're not finished yet.Final question.
Are you ready?Please,
please, leave me alone.Answer the question, and I will.What door am I at?- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.The front door,
the patio doors.If you answer correctly, you live.Very simple.Don't do this.
I can't; I won't.Your call.- Aah!Did you water over here today?- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.Mom!- Jesus!
- What is it?Casey!Oh, G...Casey. Casey.Casey!- Where is she?
- Call the police!- Casey!- Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?- Casey?
- She's here.- Mom.
- Oh, my God,
I can hear her.- Mom.
- Where is she?Oh, my God!
I can hear her.- Hey!Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.- It's just me.- Billy, what are you doing here?
- Sorry, don't hate me.- You sleep in that?
- Yes, I sleep in this.My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.- I'll just stay a sec.No... You gotta go. Go, go, go.What's going on in there?- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.No?Oh, well.
I'm hitting the sack.My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back 'til Sunday.- There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at...
- The Hilton.- Out at the airport, so call if...
- I need anything.I could've sworn
I heard screaming.Have a good trip, okay?Sleep tight, sweetie.Oh... close call.Billy, what're you doing here?It occurred to me that...- I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.Great idea, now that
it's out of your system.I was home watching television."The," uh,
"The Exorcist" was on.- It got me thinking of you.
- It did?Yeah, it was edited for TV. You know,
all the good stuff was cut out.And it got me thinking of us...how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.And now... things have changed and...lately we're just sort of
edited for television.Oh, so you thought
you would climb in my window...- and we'd have a little raw footage?
- No.No, I wouldn't dream of breaking
your underwear rule.I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.- Okay.
- Yeah?Yeah.If we ever fly awayBaby, I'm with youBaby, I'm your manHey.La, la, la, la
la, la, laOkay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-muffin.God, you see what
you do to me?You know what
my dad'll do to you?Yeah.- I'm going.
- Okay.Romeo and JulietAre together in eternityYou know, l... I appreciate
the romantic gesture.So, come on, babyHey, about the, uh,
the sex stuff?I'm not trying
to rush you at all.I was only half serious.Okay.Baby, I'm your manBaby, I'm your manHey, Billy.Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?What's that?- La, la, la-la, laMy God. You're just a tease.Thirty-five...Situation under control.Roger, dispatch.There's blood found?
All right....are doing drugs they buy
in the classrooms...and that they are
involved in the occult.Occult?Woodsboro, California,
was devastated last night...when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.Authorities have yet
to issue a statement...but our sources tell us
that no arrest has been made...- and the murderer could strike again.
- Do you believe this shit?- Damn! What is going on?
- You don't know?Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.What? No way.And we're not just talking killed;
we're talking splatter-movie killed.Ripped open from end to end.Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.Not anymore.
It's so sad.Her mom and dad, they found her
hanging from a tree...- her insides on the outside.
- Oh, my God!Do they know who did it?Fucking clueless.
They're interrogating the entire school.- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?They don't know.
Dewey was saying this is
the worst crime they've seen in years.- Even worse than...Well... it's bad.- Here you go, Mrs. Tate.
- Thank you, James.Sidney.It would appear to be your turn.- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.She was daughter of, uh...- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.Hi, Sidney.Sheriff Burke, Dewey.Uh, that's Deputy Riley today, Sid.- How is everything?
- Good.And your dad?
How's he doin'?- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.The police just want to ask you
a few questions. You okay?Mm-hmm.Sidney, were you
very close to Casey Becker?Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.All students are encouraged to return
home promptly from school grounds.Avoid strangers;
walk in twos and threes.What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?- They asked if I knew Casey.
- They asked me that too.- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.Did they ask you?Why would they ask you
if you liked to hunt?'Cause their bodies were gutted.- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.- 'Cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct."That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.Or a man's mentality.How do you... gut someone?You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she
dumped him for Steve.I thought you
dumped her for me.- I did. He's full of shit.
- And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?Hey, what're you saying?
That I killed her?It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?- Working, thank you.
- At the video store?
I thought they fired your ass.Twice.- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.Thanks, buddy.Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.- I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.
- Tell me something.Did you really put
her liver in the mailbox?'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the mailbox
next to her spleen and pancreas.You goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here.She's getting mad, all right?You better "liver" alone."Liver" alone!"Liv..." Ow!
"Liver. Liver." It was a joke.See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.So, you're sure I can stay over,
'cause my dad won't be back 'til Sunday.No problem.
I'll pick you up after practice.You okay?Uh-huh. It's just...you know, the police
and the reporters...it's like déjà vu
all over again.I'll be there by 7:00.
I promise.- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.The bodies of 17-year-old
Casey Becker...and her 18-year-old boyfriend,
Steven Orth...were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents...The Woodsboro double murder case.Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage...The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...although this is not the first time
this small community...of Woodsboro
has endured such tragedy.Only a year ago
Maureen Prescott, wife and mother...was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.- Hello?
- Practice ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?It's past 7:00.Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it 'til way after 10:00.Oh. Oh, that's comforting.I'm gonna swing by
the video store.I was thinkin' Tom Cruise,
"All The Right Moves."If you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.- Tatum, just get in the car...
- Hello, Sidney.Uh... hi, who is this?You tell me.Well, I-I have no idea.Scary night, isn't it?With the murders and all,
it's like right out of
a horror movie or something.Randy, you gave yourself away.Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.Do you like scary movies, Sidney?I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.What's your favorite scary movie?Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.- Why not? Too scared?
- No. No.It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.So, who are you?The question isn't
"Who am I?"The question is
"Where am I?"S-S-So, where are you?Your front porch.Why would you be calling
from my front porch?That's the original part.Oh, yeah?Well, I call your bluff.- So, where are you?
- Right here.- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.Uh-huh, okay.What am I doin'? Huh?Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!Nice try, Randy.Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay?
Bye now.If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.Fuck you, you cretin!No!Shit!Billy!The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?The killer's here.
He's in the house.He's in the house.
He's got a knife.He's gone.
He's gone.It's all right.What?Sid, what?Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?Sidney, come back! Sidney!Sorry! I found this. Come on!All right, hold your hands together.- Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?
- I didn't do anything.Do you wish to give up
your right to speak to an attorney...- And have them present
during questioning?Ask her. She'll tell you.- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait. Who is that?- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.I didn't do it.
Sheriff, wait.Wait, listen.
Call my dad.Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Call him.Sidney! Sidney!- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.She'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.- Sid!
- Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.You gonna be able to come
down to the station and answer
a few questions, Sid?Oh, shit! Sidney!God, Sid, I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.- It's okay.
- Her dad's out of town.
She's staying with us.Does Mom know?- Yes, doofus.
- Let's get you out of here.- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.Oh, you won't believe this.Creepy, huh?- I'll be damned.
- What?- Jesus! The camera, hurry!
- My name isn't Jesus.Sidney, is that you in there?Excuse me. Is that Sidney Prescott
they took away?- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?- None of your damned business.
- I heard something about
a costume. Is that true?- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.Leave Sid alone.Where's she goin'?- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight...but when I say "hurry,"please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"Did you find him?You sure it was the Hilton?- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.Could he have stayed
somewhere else?I don't know. I guess.Don't worry, Sid.- We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.I'll be right back.Let me ask you this. What're you doin'
with a cellular telephone, son?Everybody's got one, Sheriff.I didn't make those calls, I swear.Check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake.Call Vital Phone Comp. They got
the records of every number dialed.Thanks, Hank.
We're on top of it.What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?I wanted to see her, that's all.And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.You went out last night?I was watching TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?No, I didn't. Sheriff,
I didn't kill anybody!We're gonna have to hold you, son,
'til we get those phone records.That's crazy.You know that?
I didn't do it.Camera Two? Okay.Are there anymore
doughnuts in there?- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you
know who you're dealing with?Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!Sidney, come on.
You know me.Sidney, look at me!Come on!Sid, we're gonna get you
out of here, okay? Are you okay?They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.There's no way
to track the purchase.What about that cellular
phone bill?We're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything
until the morning.Oh, come on!- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance."But these kids today...
damned if I know.- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.- Goddamn it, Dewey!
- What did Mama tell you?When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law!I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go.- Now, okay?
- Whoa.Take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.- Come on.
- Don't touch me!- He's my superior.
- Janitors are your superior.Let's get back to work!- Isn't there a back way
out of this building?
- Yeah.Down that alley, I think.You guys just stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.Don't move.
Don't make a sound.There she is. Sidney!Hi, that's some night.
What happened? Are you all right?She's not answering any questions.
Just leave us alone.No, Tatum, it's okay.
She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?Well, it'll be out
later this year.Oh, I'll look for it.I'll send you a copy.Jeez.- Nice shot.
- Bitch.- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy."Bam! Bitch went down."I'll send you a copy."
Bam! Sid... Superbitch!You are so cool.Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.Thanks.I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.Yeah, yeah.- Do you really think Billy did it?He was there, Tatum.He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.- Telephone, honey.- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.My dad?- I don't think so.
- Take a message.No, um, I'll get it.How's she doin'?Hello.Hello, Sidney.No!Poor Billy-boyfriend.An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.- Leave me alone!
- Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy... again.- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.Don't worry.
You'll find out soon enough.- I promise.What?- What?
- What?Hello?Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...is the daughter
of Maureen Prescott...who was brutally
killed last year...when convicted murderer
Cotton Weary broke into their home...and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.She was the key witness in
the state's case against the...It's never gonna stop, is it?Billy was released.His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.Okay?Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.So how does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?- Hey, leave her alone!
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.What?Just a sec.Stop right there.I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.Somebody was gonna write about it.And it had to be you with all your lies
and bullshit theories.What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.Cotton Weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.Do you still think
he's innocent?Your testimony put him away.
It doesn't really matter what I think.During the trial, you did
all those stories about me.
You called me a liar.I think you
falsely identified him, yes.- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.And has his story changed?Not one word.He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.He's lying.
She never would've touched him.He raped her,
and then he...He butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.He was drunk that night.He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.No. Cotton murdered my mother.You're not so sure anymore,
are you?Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.The killer's still
on the loose, isn't he?- Come on, Sid.
- Those murders are related.I'm sorry I mangled your face.- Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?Jesus Christ!An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.- Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?- Not so fast. We don't have
anything concrete.
- You can't just sit on it.I know!
That's why we need proof.If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.I want you to meet me right here
after class, okay, Sid?All right.Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!Why are they doing this?Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.Sidney!- Ow!
- Jesus, shit!It's just me.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.No. No, I-I don't.It's just...
somebody was there.Billy, someone tried to kill me.I know, I know. The cops said
I scared him away. It wasn't me, Sid.I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.You see? It couldn't have
been me. I was in jail.Remember?I'm so... sorry.
Please understand.Understand what?That I have a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me...of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?You know that's not true.- Then what is it?
- What... is it?Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!I mean between us.You haven't been
the same since...- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.I think it's time
you got over that.When my mom left my dad,
I accepted it. That's the way it is.She's not coming back.Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's a bad analogy.It's just that...I want my girlfriend back.Sid!Billy, I am sorry
if my traumatized life...is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.What? Wh...
Nobody said that. Sid!Stupid.You make me so sick!Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!So, two of
your fellow students...just savagely murdered...and this is the way you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!Come on, Mr. Himbry!
It was just a joke.That's not fair!You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.Fairness would be
to rip your insides out...hang you from a tree
so we can expose you...for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.- Why would she lie about it?
- For attention!The girl has some serious issues.What if she did it?What if Sidney killed
Casey and Steve?Why would she do that?Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend.Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack. She watched
her mom get butchered.And it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.Her mother's death leaves her
disturbed and hostile.In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.- Where do you get this shit?
- Ricki Lake.You are pathetic.Pathetic.Sidney.Is someone there?In what appears to be a prank...several students were seen
wearing scary masks.School officials
have yet to comment...but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth
have already lost their lives.Who's next?You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.Hi! Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story."I know who you are,
Miss Weathers.- How's the eye?
- It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?No, everything's under control.- Of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker...but who knew?You look awfully young
to be a police officer.I'm 25 years old.You know, in a demographic study...I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.Except in that
upper torso area.- Does the force require you to work out?
- No, ma'am.'Cause of my boyish good looks...muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.I need your attention now, kids.Due to the recent events
that have occurred...effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.- The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...beginning at 9:00 tonight.Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.Serial killer's
not really accurate.Gotta knock off
a couple more to get that title.Well, we can hope, can't we?I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.- He's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out
as a... possibility.- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...you are much prettier in person.So you do watch the show.I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.Please, call me Gale!It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.You're not to pee alone anymore.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."I don't know what you did, Sidney.But on behalf of the entire
student body, we all say, "Thank you!"- Drop it, Stu.
- I say...an impromptu party tonight,
my house.Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?Are you serious?This little vixen...doesn't invite the entire world,
we'll be fine.Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.What do you say, Sid?I mean, pathos could
have its perks.Totally protected.
Yo, I am so buff.I got you covered, girl.Come on, Sid. For me?
It could be fun.Okay. Whatever.Yeah? Nice.Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?Yes?Hello?- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.Aaaah! Aaah!Ohhhhh!School's out for summer- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?Maybe he was having
an affair with your mom.I mean, your dad was always out of town
on business. Maybe...Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.If they were having an affair, how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.Right. Created by that
little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.It goes further back, Sid.There's been talk
about other men.And you believe it.Well, you can only hear
that Richard Gere gerbil story
so many times...before you have to start
believing it.Oh, I'm sorry.Y-You know, if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary...then... the killer's
still out there.Don't go there, Sid.You're starting to sound like some
Wes Carpenter flick or something.Don't freak yourself, okay? We've got
a long night ahead of us. Okay?Let's boogie.It's alive!- Henry...
- Oh, in the name of God,
now I know...Excuse me, dude.- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.Ohhhh!Dork.Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.- We had a run
in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?Yeah, I'm off early.
Curfew, you know.What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?- "The Howling."
Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...would you be standing
in the horror section?What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.You're such a little lapdog.- He's got "killer" printed
all over his forehead.
- Ohhh-kay!Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?Obviously they don't
watch enough movies. This is
standard horror movie stuff.- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all:
Simplicity.Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.Well, what's his reason?Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.- What, is she
savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?No, I don't at all. No.You know who I think it is?You know, I think it's her father.Why can't they find her pops, man?Because he's probably dead.His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!- The police are always
off track with this shit.
- Man!If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.There's a formula to it.
A very simple formula!
Everybody's a suspect!I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.How do we know
you're not the killer? Huh?- Huh?
- Hi, Billy.Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button. You ever think of that?You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.And what would be your motive?It's the millennium.Motives are incidental."Millennium." Hmm."Millennium." I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.Good kid."Millennium."
Good word, my man.Are you telling me
that's not a killer?You'll see him
in your nightmaresYou'll see him
in your dreamsHe'll appear
out of nowhereBut he ain'tWhat he seemsYou'll see him
in your headOn the TV screenHey, buddy, I'm warnin' you
to turn it offAh, he's a ghost
He's a godHe's a man
He's a guruYou're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic planDesigned and directed
by his red right handSure is quiet.God, look at this place.It's "The Town
That Dreaded Sundown."Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?- Mmm.
- Hey, Sid, just think.If they make a movie about you,
who's gonna play you?- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.You girls don't go too far.Is Billy gonna be there tonight?He'd better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.Billy's right, you know. Whenever he
touches me, I just can't relax.So you have a few
intimacy issues as a result of
your mother's untimely death.That's no big deal.
You'll thaw out.Yeah, but he has been so patient
with me with all the sex stuff.How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?Dewey, where the hell you been?I was keepin' an eye
on Sidney, uh...- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it...Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.There's no way a cellular
coulda been cloned?There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.The anniversary
of his wife's death.We'll keep the roadblocks and
the curfew in effect through the night.If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.- You want me to bring her in?
- Naw.Not just yet.Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.You stay close to Sidney.Don't let her
out of your sight.Yes, sir.Say a prayer
for the youth of AmericaGod bless the youth
of AmericaI can't stand
their sight anymore- All right, you girls have fun.Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.You're obsessedYou're obsessed- Here, kids!Oh! That's absurd.You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.- My man!Shh.Were we spotted?I don't think so.
Go get the camera.- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare ya.- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.Then what are you doing here?Just keepin' an eye on things.I'm gonna check the party out.- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.Let me just get my coat. Thanks.- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.Oh! Yeah.- How many "Evil Deads"?
- One! Two!- How many "Hellraisers"?
- Hellraiser right here."The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night."How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?She's the... scream queen.- With a set of lungs
like that, she should be.
- Yeah.Tits. See?- Oh, I'll get it.Hey, Tate, grab another beer,
would ya?- There's more
beer in the garage.What am I, the beer wench?- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- Oh, yeah?You are not gonna believe who's here!
It's that chick from "Top Story"!- Gale Weathers?
- Here. Yeah.You're under age, son.I'm kiddin'.
Have a good time.- Dewey.
- Hi.Dewey.- What is she doing here?
- She's with me!- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.- Hey.
- Hey.- I need a camera.- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one
I want..."Halloween."- Too bad, I've spokenWhen I look at you
you're forgivenMmm.You're forgiven- Jesus!Tatum, it's okay.Shit.Hey, shitheads!Hello!Shit. Piss.Is that you, Randy?Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage"?Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?Can I be the helpless victim?Okay, let's see... No, please
don't kill me, Mr. Ghost Face.I wanna be in the sequel!Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.Randy, what the hell
are you doing? Aaah!Aaah! Stop!Aaaah!Fucker!Aaah!- Aaah! Aaaah!Aaaaah!No! No!- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here
but us chickens!- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.- Aaah!Oh. Billy. Hey.Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.Why don't you go up
to my parents' room?You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.Oooh! Oww.What's Leatherface doin' here?Cute. He came to make up.There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.As if. That's all I'm sayin'.As if.Oh, really, Alicia?"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.- Come on!
- It was nice
to meet all of you.You're a genius.- Oh, shit.
- What?- I got a delay.
- How long is it?I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?Lt'll be fine. Just record it.
Oh, the placement is perfect.- Tell me, Kenneth...
- Hmm?Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?Well, first time
for everything.You're damn right.S-So, um...- So...I'm sorry.I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.No, Billy, I-I'm...the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...with all this
post-traumatic stress.- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.Enough is enough.I can't wallow in
the grief process forever...and...and I can't...keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.Yeah, I think
I'm really...scared...that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.And I know it doesn't make sense.Yeah, it does.Hmm.It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.But this is life.This isn't a movie.Sure it is, Sid.It's all...
It's all a movie.It's all...one great big movie.Only you can't pick your genre.Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?Or even a good porno.What?You heard me.Are you sure?Yeah.I think so.Look, look, look.
Here it comes.- Whoa!
- Ohh!The blood is all wrong!
Why do they do that? It's too red!Wait. Here comes another.- Oooh! Oooh!
- Yes! Yes!Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.- How can you watch
this shit over and over?
- Shh!I wanna see
Jamie Lee's breasts.- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Breasts?Not until "Trading Places" in '83.Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.- She never showed her tits
'til she went legits.
- Could afford a decent pair.That's why she always
outsmarted the killer in the
big chase scene at the end.Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?- What rules?
- You don't...Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?There are certain rules
one must abide by...in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.Big no-no!
Big no-no!I'd be a dead man.Sex equals death. Okay?Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.No, the sin factor.It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.And number three: Never, ever, ever
under any circumstances, say..."I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.- I'll be right back!
- Ohhhh!You push the laws and you end up dead.
See you in the kitchen with a knife.Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?You don't know the rules?- There are rules one must abide
by to survive a horror movie.
- Boring.- For instance...The sheriff just radioed.Somebody reported a car
in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.If you're sure it's all right.Uh, ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.Be right back.- Kids Shouting, Whooping]You push the laws,
you end up dead.- W... Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?I thought maybe we'd walk.It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.You're not scared, are ya?No.- All right.
- Great.- Do you know what that constellation is?
- No. What is it?- I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.What happened to Tatum, Stu?She probably got pissed
at me and bailed. Bye.No, I'm just kidding.Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!- Yes! Oh! Beautiful!
- Lovely!Ohh! Ohh.- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.You are so...amazing.- Hello? Yeah?Holy shit.Listen up.They found
Principal Himbry dead.He was gutted and hung from the goalpost
on the football field.- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go over there
before they bring him down.- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!- Where did he say he was?
- At the football field!- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?We were just gettin'
to the good part.Hello? Yeah?- Whoo!Hi-ho, Silver! Let's go!So, is... is Dewey
your real name?No, it's Dwight.Dwight?- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.Well, I like it.Sexy.- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.What about Gale Weathers?Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.People treat me...like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?- No? No.That's just 'cause
you kinda like me.- They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!- Freeze... Jump!I'm sorry. Are you okay?Yeah.I'm sorry.I'm on duty.Is that what you're looking for?My whole life.- Damn!
- What?- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.Jesus. What's he doing here?We gotta get back.You okay?Yeah.Yeah, I'm fine.Who'd you call?What?Um, well, I don't know,
when you're arrested you're
allowed one phone call.So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?Called my dad.No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.Huh.You don't still think
it was me, do ya?No.No.I was just thinking, if it were
you it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.You know, using your one phone call to
call me so I wouldn't think it was you.Really.What do I have to do to prove to you
that I'm not a killer?- Oh, my God.
- Huh?- Oh, my God.
- Sidney...
- Billy, watch out!- Aaah!
- Aaaah!Sid.No!- Shit!Help me, somebody! Help me!Help me!No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.You... You know...Look, there he is.
I told you.I told you he was
right around the corner.Jamie. Jamie.Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.Turn around.
Behind you.All the time!
Behind you!Behind you, Jamie.Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.Help me! Help!- Let me in!- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.Jamie. Jamie.- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!- Behind ya!
- Look around!- Shit.
- What?- We're on 30-second delay.
- Oh, my God.Aaaah!The... door.Aaah!- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.Be careful!- Neil?Mr. Prescott?Shit!Oh!Kenny, I need the cellular!Kenny!- Kenny!
- Kenny! Kenny!- 9-1-1.- What's going on?
- Ooh! Aah!Aaaah!Oh, God!Oh!Oh, God, Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!- Stop!Oh, God!Dewey!Dewey!- Dewey, where are you?Dewey!Sidney?Dewey!Shit!7825, suspect at 105 North Avenue 52.Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's going to try and kill me.Sidney! Sidney!Jesus, we've got to get
the fuck out of here!- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!- Stay back!
- Stu did it.- He killed Billy. He killed my Tatum.
- You did it!- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!Sidney, baby, please,
give me that gun!Give me that gun!
Christ, man!No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!- Open up! He did it!Help me! He's going crazy!- Sidney! Go away!Sidney?Leave me alone.- Sid.
- Billy.Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.No, I'm like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.Get up.- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.- No, he's out there!
- No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.It's okay. It's okay.Careful.- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!We all go a little mad sometimes.- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!Anthony Perkins, "Psycho."Mmm.Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in "Carrie."Stu.Help me, please.Surprise, Sidney.- No!
- Ooh!Oh, now. Whoa.What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.Why are you doing this?It's all part
of the game, Sidney.- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die."
- Fuck you!No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong,"boo-kah," you die!You get it right, you die.- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer
the term "psychotic."- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?Tell that to Cotton Weary.You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.Watch a few movies,
take a few notes.- It was fun. - No!- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?Why?- Why did you kill my mother?Why? Why?Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.I don't really believe
in motive, Sid.- I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.Did they ever really decide
why Hannibal Lecter liked to
eat people? Don't think so!See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.We did your mom a favor, Sid.That woman was a slut-bag whore
who flashed her shit all over
town like she was Sharon Stone.Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney,your mother
was no Sharon Stone, hmm?Is that motive enough for you?How about this?Your slut mother
was fucking my father,and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.How's that for a motive?Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behavior.It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin. Oooh!I said "virgin." Whoops!Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.Let's pretend it's all
a scary movie, Sid. How do
you think it's gonna end?Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.We got a surprise for you, Sidney.Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.You know what time it is, Sid?It's after midnight.It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.We killed her exactly
one year ago today.Attention! Oh, what do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it.That's enough.- Guess we won't be needing this anymore.
- Uh-huh!And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.Got the ending
figured out yet, Sid?Come on, Sidney.
You think about it now, huh?Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?Your mother's anniversary
set him off, and he went on
a murder spree, killing everyone.Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.Then he... kills you...and shoots himself
in the head.- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.Watch this.- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!Good one, man. Jesus.Oh, shit.My turn.Don't forget. Stay to the side
and don't go too deep.Okay. I'll remember.Aaah! Fuck! Fuck!Fuck! Goddamn it, Stu!Sorry, Billy. I guess I got
a little too zealous, huh?- Give me the knife.
- No.Give me the knife!Now!You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.We get to carry on
and plan the sequel,'cause let's face it, baby,
these days ya gotta have a sequel!You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.Now, Sid, don't you
blame the movies.Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!Stop it, Billy,
would you? All right?I can't take any more.
I feel a little woozy here!All right. All right,
you get the gun.I'll untie Pops, okay?- Now!
- Okay.Um. Uh...Houston, we...
we have a problem here.- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.I put it right there,
and it's not there.- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.The reporter left for dead
in the news van...comes to,stumbles on
you two dipshits,finds the gun,foils your plan
and saves the day.I like that ending.I know something you don't.Fuck. No!Yeah, man.Yeah. Aw, so sweet.- It works better
without the safety on.This is Gale Weathers signing off.Babe, you're gonna love this!Shit.What?- Where are they?
Where are they?I don't know,
but I'm hurtin', man.- Fuck!Shall I let the machine get it?- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass."- Find her, you dipshit. Get up.
- I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.I think I'm dying here, man.- Talk to her. Talk to her.- Hello.
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive?Billy's got one. The police are on
their way. What are you gonna tell them?Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch,
just like your fucking mother!- You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!Ow. You fuckin' hit me
with the phone, dick!- Fucker, where are you?- You fuck!- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.My mom and dad
are gonna be so mad at me.Aaah! Bitch!Aaah!Aaah!Aah!Ohh! My arm!I always had a thing for ya, Sid!- Bitch.
- In your dreams.- I'm sorry. It's all right.Oh, my God, Randy,
I thought you were dead.I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.- Fucker!- Say hello to your mother.Aaah!It's okay.Guess I remembered
the safety that time, you bastard.Careful.This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life...for one last scare.Not in my movie.Dad.Randy, help me out.- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?- Are you okay?
- Yeah.- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.Okay, I think it's going to go
something like this. Just stay with me.- Hi, this is Gale Weathers...with an exclusive eyewitness account
of this amazing breaking story.Several more local teens
are dead...bringing to an end the harrowing mystery
of the mass killing...that has terrified
this peaceful community...like the plot
of some scary movie.It all began with
a scream over 9-1-1...and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of Woodsboro,all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...far from the crimes and the sirens
of the larger cities...that its residents had fled.Okay, let's take it back
to one. Come on. Move it.This is my big shot. Let's go.Love comes down upon us
and it flows like waterBurning with the hope
of insightThere the books, the colors
of a bright elationStolen in the sight of loveWe are, we are, we are
We're just childrenFighting our way

Am I right?

Hey, you really know the ropes.
Damn. I wish I'd bumped into you before.

And one for my friend here too.

417
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,823
I know when I give satisfaction.
I give her satisfaction.

418
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,496
I mean, you see what I'm getting at here?

419
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,665
She's got a penthouse up there

420
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,960
with a color TV and more goddamn diamonds
than an archbishop.

421
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,379
And she busts out bawlin'
when I ask her for money.

422
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,752
- For what?
- For money.

423

Wait a minute. Money for what?

424
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,296
Well, hell, I'm a hustler.
You didn't know that?

425
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,551
How am I supposed to know that?
You gotta tell a person these things.

426
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,556
- I'm a hustler.
- Shh.

427
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,937
All right. You're a hustler.

428
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,565
But, I mean, your pickin' up trade
on the street like that, that's nowhere.

429
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,272
I mean, you gotta get yourself
some kind of management.

430
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,279
I think you put your finger on it.

431
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,361
You know what you need?

432
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,411
You need my friend O'Daniel.

433
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,706
He operates the biggest stable in town.

434
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,284
In fact, in the whole
goddamn metropolitan area.

435
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,290
It's stupid, a stud like you paying.

436
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,588
You don't wanna be stupid.
I mean, I understand.

437
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,257
A dame starts cryin',
I'd cut my heart out for her.

438
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,177
I'd call that a very minor operation.

439
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,676
In fact, you just sit comfy

440
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,849
and I'll cut it out
with my fingernail file, Ratso.

441
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:25,800
The name's Rizzo.

442
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,851
That's what I said. Ratso.

443
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,476
- Hey. You heard him.
- That's all right, Joe.

444
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,024
I mean, you know, I'm used to these types

445
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,067
that get their kicks pickin' on cripples.

446
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:38,113
- The sewer's full of them.
- I wanna ask you one question, cowboy.

447
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,859
If you're sitting over here,
and he's sitting all the way over there,

448
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,944
then how's he gonna get his hand
into your pocket?

449
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,031
- Well, suppose you let me work...
- Oh, but I guess he's got that all figured out.

450
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,707
Good night, sweets.

451
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,705
Faggot.

452
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,286
- [man] Provolone.
- Faggot.

453
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,043
Look, with these gals that wanna buy it,

454
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,671
most of them are old and dignified.

455
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,127
Social register types.
You know what I mean?

456
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,885
They can't be trottin' down to Times Square
to pick out the merchandise.

457
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,718
They gotta have some kind of a middleman.

458
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,554
That's where O'Daniel comes in.
You know what I mean?

459
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,731
- [tires screech, horn honks]
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

460
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,809
I'm walkin' here!

461
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,519
- Up yours, you son of a bitch!
- Get out of the way!

462
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,696
You don't talk to me that way!
Get outta here!

463
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,397
[horn honking]

464
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,368
Don't worry about that.

465
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,197
Actually, that ain't a bad way
to pick up insurance.

466
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,251
[Ratso] It's crazy, a stud like you paying that
dame that you told me about double sawbucks.

467
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,044
You know, with proper management,

468
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,669
you could be takin' home $50,
maybe $100 a day, easy.

469
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,672
Hey, Brucie. Hang in there, baby.

470
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,465
What's that?

471
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,594
Him I placed with O'Daniel
about two weeks ago.

472
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,017
He ain't much of a stud either,
from what I hear.

473
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,236
All right, all right.

474
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,563
- Hey, horse.
- [Ratso coughs]

475
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,400
How about you take me to meet
this Mr. O'Diddleburg right now?

476
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,110
- What do you say about that?
- Well, Joe, you're a nice guy.

477
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,868
And I'd be doin' both of youse a favor.
But, you know, for what?

478
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,292
What am I draggin' my bum leg
around town for, you know?

479
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:18,463
Tomorrow, some peach like that is liable to be
scratching your back over there at the Plaza.

480
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,540
And where am I gonna be, you know? Where?

481
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,753
H-Hold on. Hold it right there.
You think I'm that kind of a son of a bitch?

482
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,758
Well, you just name your cut.

483
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,306
Whatever you want, you got it right now.
I swear.

484
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,554
It's all right.

485
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,556
What you want? Five? Ten?

486
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:36,139
What, are you kidding me?
You know what? I'd "ax" somebody else.

487
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,647
- There's ten right there.
- All right, all right. Forget it.

488
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,477
I'll take the ten.

489
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,813
But when I take you over
to see Mr. O'Daniel,

490
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,275
I'm gonna have to have another ten
just to cover expenses. All right?

491
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,655
- Uh...
- Come on.

492
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,032
I'll buy youse coffee. On me. [coughing]

493
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,749
Get outta here. Come on.
Bunch of creeps. Go to work.

494
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,339
He needs you right now. Tonight.

495
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,542
I got his tongue hangin' out.

496
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,673
He... His name is Joe Buck.
He's a cowboy.

497
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,801
He just, uh... Just came in from Texas.
He, uh... Very new to the city.

498
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,427
He don't quite know the ropes.

499
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,477
But he's very promising material, sir,
if you know what I mean.

500
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,563
[Ratso] <i>Fabulous. Right away.</i>

501
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,437
<i>What's your, uh, room
number there again, sir?</i>

502
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,443
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

503
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,194
901. You got it?
Hey, hold it a second, will ya?

504
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,196
Let's see how you look.

505
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,782
Fine. Fine.

506
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,287
You look fine.

507
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,336
Uh, think I could have that other ten now?

508
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,373
Where can I reach you?

509
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,084
'Cause I'm gon' make this thing right
with you soon as I get me set up.

510
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,636
- Forget it.
- I mean it, damn it. Where do you live?

511
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,884
Uh, it's the Sherry-Netherlands Hotel.

512
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,432
Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.
[murmuring] Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.

513
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,386
Hurry up now. Get your ass in there.
He's waitin'. Go ahead.

514
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,346
Come on. What, are you on vacation?

515
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,899
[Ratso] Don't close the doors on me.
What's the matter with you?

516
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,978
[jazz trumpet playing]

[trumpet continues playing]

518
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,829
You must be Joe Buck.

519
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,578
Yes, sir, I am.

520
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,659
Come on in. Let's take a look at you.

521
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,754
- [door closes]
- [trumpet continues playing, faint]

522
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,382
Turn round. Turn round.

523
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,641
Good, strong back.
You're gonna need it.

524
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,178
Yeah.

525
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,684
So you want help, eh?

526
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,936
Yeah. Sit down, sit down. Relax.

527
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,268
Yeah.

528
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,985
Cowboy, eh?

529
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,946
Uh, w-well, sir, I... I
ain't a for-real cowboy.

530
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,998
But I am one hell of a stud! [chuckles]

531
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,541
Take it easy, boy.

532
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:06,252
Seems to me you're different
from most of the boys that come to me.

533
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,300
Most of those boys
are troubled and confused.

534
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,467
I'd say you know exactly what you want.

535
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,799
- You bet I do, sir.
- Yeah.

536
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,851
But I'll bet you got one thing in common
with those other boys.

537
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,603
I'll bet you're lonesome.

538
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,065
Well, not too.

539
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,773
I mean, a little.

540
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,779
Yeah.

541
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,656
Lonesome!

542
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,744
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a drunk."

543
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,576
- "I'm lonesome, so I'm a dope fiend."
- [woman] Oh, shut up!

544
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,661
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a thief."

545
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,121
- "I'm lonesome, so I'm a fornicator!"
- [banging on wall]

547
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,712
Poop, I say! Poop!

548
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,384
I've heard it all.

549
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,555
I've heard it all, and I'm sick of it.
Sick to death of it!

550
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,257
- Yes, sir, I can see that.
- Lonesomeness.

551
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,436
Lonesomeness is something
you take, you hear?

552
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,265
Damn it, you take it
and you go right on with your work.

553
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,226
- I'm rarin' to go, sir.
- Yes, I believe you are.

554
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,274
- Cowboy, eh?
- Yes, sir.

555
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,731
Yeah. Ready for some hard work, son?

556
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,691
- I'm ready for anything.
- Yeah.

557
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,699
I reckon it's gonna be a lot easier
for you, Joe Buck, than for most others.

558
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,078
- It's gonna be like money from home, sir.
- Money from home!

559
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,535
There's your strength, son. See?

560
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,168
You've got the way of putting things earthy
so that anybody can understand them.

561
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,709
I warn you, Joe Buck. I'm gonna use you.

562
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,378
I'm gonna run you ragged!

563
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,930
- Whoo-hah!
- [laughing]

564
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,225
You're wonderful, boy.
You and me, we're gonna have fun together.

565
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,224
- It don't have to be joyless.
- Hell, no, it don't have to be.

566
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,857
Say, why don't you and me

567
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,936
get right down on our knees right now?

568
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,320
How's that strike you?

569
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,319
- Where?
- Right here!

578

Just open your heart a little more!

Look in there, boy.
Some of that stuff's for you too.

1370
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,086
Look. Try that on for size for you.

1371
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,594
I got some of that stuff
you like to swill too.

1372
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,300
Aspirin, Mentholatum, all that crap.

1373
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:39,523
- What's the matter? They wrong?
- They're okay.

1374
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,601
Only why'd you buy 'em?

1375
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:44,937
While you were gettin' the aspirin,
I could've lifted this.

1376
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,363
Is that hot?

1377
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,696
- Yeah. You want some soup?
- Yeah.

1378
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,823
I'll get you some soup then.

1379
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,701
We ain't gonna have to steal no more,
is what I'm tryin' to tell you.

1380
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:58,250
I got eight bucks in my damn pockets.
Twenty more come Thursday, boy.

1381
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,669
We're gonna be ridin' easy before very long,
I'm gonna tell you.

1382
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,667
Give me some soup. Give me some soup.

1383
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,670
What do you think I'm gettin' here?
I'm gettin' you some soup.

1384
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,844
Look at that there.
That's good, healthy stuff for you.

1385
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:11,634
Lookee there. Lookee there. Soup.

1386
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,932
- Thanks.
- It's hot. Watch out.

1387
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:16,768
How was she?

1388
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,731
Well, she went crazy,
if you want to know the damn truth of it.

1389
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:23,776
- Yeah?
- Yeah. She turned into a damn alley cat.

1390
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:26,729
- Thanks for the stuff.
- Don't mention it.

1391
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:29,482
It's good.

1392
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:35,496
Hey, listen,
don't get sore or anything, okay?

1393
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:37,197
I ain't sore.

1394
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,626
I don't think I can walk anymore.

1395
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,999
I mean, I've been fallin' down a lot.

1396
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:48,133
I'm scared.

1397
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,836
What are you scared of?

1398
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:54,632
You know what they do to you
when they know you can't...

1399
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:57,890
when they find out that you can't wa... walk.

1400
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,436
Oh, Christ!

1401
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:04,479
I gotta lay down.

1402
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,561
- Okay, okay.
- I gotta lay down.

1403
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,691
You're gonna lay down now.
Just take it easy.

1404
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,773
- Come on.
- I'm gonna lay you down.

1405
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,617
I'm gonna lay you down. There you go.

1406
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:17,537
I'm gonna put this thing over you.

1407
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,364
Now, you stay here.

1408
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,414
Where you goin'?

1409
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:25,621
- I gotta get a doctor.
- What?

1410
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:28,002
- I gotta get a doctor.
- You ain't gettin' me no doctor.

1411
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:30,709
You're sick, boy. You need a damn doctor.

1412
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:34,592
Hey! No doctors, no cops.
Don't be so stupid.

1413
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:37,800
- What the hell you want me to do?
- Florida. You get me to Florida.

1414
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:40,762
Oh, hell, I can't go to Florida now.

1415
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:43,438
Just put me on a bus.
Just put me on a bus. I don't need you.

1416
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,187
You got the damn fever.
How the hell you gonna get to Florida?

1417
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,145
Just get me on a bus.
You ain't sendin' me to Bellevue.

1418
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:52,356
All right. What are you doin'?
What are you doin' that for? It's hot.

1419
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:56,114
- You're sick. I'm keepin' it on you.
- No. I'm too hot now.

1420
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:59,072
Dumb. Boy, you're really dumb.

1421
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:01,532
- I don't need you. You're dumb.
- Shut up! Just shut up!

1422
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,117
Dumb cowboy, boy.

1423
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,669
Damn it. Shut up!

1424
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:10,341
Oh, just when things are goin' right for me,
you gotta pull a damn stunt like this.

1425
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:15,455
Hi, Shirley. How you doin', girl?

1426
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:18,299
Miss who?

1427
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:22,636
Well, when will Mrs. Gardner be home?

1428
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,648
This is a friend of hers.
This is a goddamn good friend of hers.

1429
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:28,225
Now, you...

1430
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:33,898
Well, hell, I can't wait that long.

1431
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,286
[clanging]

1432
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,421
- [bell dings]
- [man] Too bad.

1433
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:58,472
- Well, we all have our off days.
- [imitating shooting]

1434
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:03,053
I'm Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
Call me Towny.

1435
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:08,232
I'm here on a paper manufacturers convention
and, frankly, to have a little fun, damn it.

1436
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:11,901
This is my first night in town, and I'd consider
it a privilege if you'd have dinner with me.

1437
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:15,106
Anywhere you say. There's a little
French restaurant not too far from here.

1438
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,486
Italian restaurant? Does that appeal to you?

1439
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,159
Don't worry about how you're dressed.
They know me.

1440
01:39:22,248 --> 01:39:24,080
Besides, I'll tell 'em you're with the rodeo.

1441
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:26,955
There's always a rodeo in town, damn it.

1442
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,957
Besides, you look very elegant.

1443
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:34,667
Oh, but damn it all, we can't do that.
I'm expecting a telephone call at the hotel.

1444
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,510
Mama? A coincidence.

1445
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:40,089
Guess who was being discussed.

1446
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,971
Have you got that thing turned up?

1447
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,347
Well, why aren't you wearing it?

1448
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:48,351
Oh, really, Mama, this is just impossible.

1449
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:51,024
I mean, why go to all the expense?

1450
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:54,023
- Why go to all the expense, Mama? The expense.
- Listen, Towny.

1451
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:56,856
Did I tell you I got me
a sick kid on my hands?

1452
01:39:56,949 --> 01:40:01,034
Well, he is. He's sick on chill,
and I gotta get him south quick as I can.

1453
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,823
I got me a sick boy,
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna get him south.

1454
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,909
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me, Towny?

1455
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,369
I'm gonna get him south.

1456
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,337
What you want?

1457
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,132
What you got me up here for?

1458
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,710
Oh, Joe, it's...

1459
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:20,712
It's so difficult. I...

1460
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:25,472
You're a nice person, Joe.
I should never have asked you up here.

1461
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:29,642
You're a lovely person, really.

1462
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,356
Oh, God, I loathe life. I loathe it.

1463
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:38,196
Please go. Please.

1464
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:39,773
You want me to leave?

1465
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:43,152
No.

1466
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,497
I mean, yes, yes. Please go.

1467
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:50,625
Come back tomorrow. Promise?

1468
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:52,247
I'm goin' to Florida tomorrow.

1469
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,962
That's terrible.

1470
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,132
You meet someone, you think...

1471
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:58,629
Yeah.

1472
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,131
I want to give you a present...

1473
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:04,256
for your trip.

1474
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:07,926
Please take it.

1475
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:12,013
I want you to have it.

1476
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,482
You don't have to be a Catholic.

1477
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:16,481
<i>St. Christopher's the patron saint
of all travelers.</i>

1478
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:20,110
I want you to take it.
It's for helping me be good.

1479
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:23,150
I gotta have money.

1480
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,825
Yes, of course. Wait here.

1481
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,623
I said wait.

1482
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,631
Here. Don't even thank me.

1483
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,383
I gotta have more than ten.

1484
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:46,385
- I gotta have $57.
- I simply don't have it, Joe.

1485
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,764
- I got family, goddamn it.
- You're wasting your time, Joe.

1486
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:52,562
- There's nothing in here.
- Get outta my way, please, sir.

1487
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:56,065
- Get outta my way!
- [grunts]

1488
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:57,893
- No, no, no.
- Let go of that table, please, sir.

1489
01:41:57,987 --> 01:42:00,274
- No, you... Please, sir?
- No, please!

1490
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,401
No, don't, don't.

1491
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,608
No. No. Don't.

1492
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,490
Oh, I deserve that.
I brought this on myself, I know I did.

1493
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:11,369
- My nose is bleeding, isn't it?
- Now, you gonna let go of that table?

1494
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:12,449
No, no.

1495
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:15,581
Now, are you gonna let go of that table,
or you want a busted skull?

1496
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:18,664
Oh, Joe, Joe, Joe. [groans]

Not this morning, but the next at 11:30.

01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:13,487
I mean, what's the whole point
of this trip anyway?

1520
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,413
You know?

1521
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,491
Keep your blankets on you.

1522
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:24,169
I mean, can you see this guy
running around the beach all suntanned

1523
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,841
and he's goin' swimmin', like,

1524
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:30,546
and then somebody yells, "Hey, Ratso."

1525
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,298
What's that sound like to you?

1526
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,934
Sounds like they knew you.

1527
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,264
Sounds like crap. Admit it.

1528
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,269
I'm Rico all the time, okay?

1529
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,615
We're gonna tell all these new people
my name's Rico.

1530
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:54,486
Okay?

1531
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:56,245
Okay.

1532
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:33,033
Hey, what's the matter?

1533
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:34,529
I'm wet.

1534
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,327
You're... You're what?

1535
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:39,448
I wet my pants. The seat's all wet.

1536
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:44,537
Well, hell, there ain't no use cryin'
over the damn thing.

1537
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,132
Here I am goin' to Florida, my leg hurts,

1538
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:51,710
my butt hurts, my chest hurts,
my face hurts,

1539
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:55,172
and like that ain't enough,
I gotta pee all over myself.

1540
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:57,053
[laughing]

1541
01:45:57,142 --> 01:46:00,761
That's funny? I'm fallin' apart here.

1542
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:04,139
You just... You know what happened?

1543
01:46:04,233 --> 01:46:07,601
You just took a little rest stop
that wasn't on the schedule.

1544

[coughing]

When we get to Miami,

what I'm gonna do is get some sort of job,
you know?

of makin' a livin' than that.

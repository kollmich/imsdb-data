<i>[MAN] I was sheriff of this
county when I was 25 years old.</i><i>Hard to believe.</i><i>My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.</i><i>Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.</i><i>I think he's pretty
proud of that.</i><i>I know I was.</i><i>Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.</i><i>Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.</i><i>That's the younger Jim.</i><i>Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear
one up in Comanche County.</i><i>I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.</i><i>Never missed a chance to do so.</i><i>You can't help but compare
yourself against the old-timers.</i><i>Can't help but wonder how they'd
have operated these times.</i><i>There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.</i><i>My arrest and my testimony.</i><i>He killed a 14-year-old girl.</i><i>Paper said it was
a crime of passion,</i><i>but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.</i><i>Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.</i><i>Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.</i><i>Said he knew
he was going to hell.</i><i>Be there in about 15 minutes.</i><i>I don't know
what to make of that.</i><i>I sure do don't.</i><i>The crime you see now, it's
hard to even take its measure.</i><i>It's not that I'm afraid of it.</i><i>I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.</i><i>But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out</i><i>and meet something
I don't understand.</i><i>A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.</i><i>He'd have to say, "OK.</i><i>I'll be part of this world."</i>Yes, sir, I just walked
in the door.He had some sort
of thing on him,like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something,and a hose that
run down his sleeve.<i>[MAN] Oxygen tank? What the
hell's he got that for?</i>You got me. Well, you can
look at it when you get in.<i>- I'll be down there in a bit.

to find those vehicles.I'm across the river

a little of the money.If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.He's a peculiar man.Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugsor anything like that.
Not like you.Yeah. He's not even like me.No, he don't talk as much as
you. I give him points for that.Carla Jean,
thank you for coming.Don't know why I did.I told you,

of very pissed off livestock.You'll excuse the... Well...Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head,but with the swinging and

I could just go home.- You could.

There's 14 grand in it.And everybody just walks away.An ATM.I know where the satchel is.If you knew, you would

- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.I can't think of any other word
for it. Who are these people?Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,cash their
Social Security checks.Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.Maybe their television set
was broke.And this went on until,
here, I quote,"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premiseswearing only a dog collar."You can't make up such a thing
as that. I dare you to try.But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.[SUPPRESSES LAUGHTER]Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.Ain't a whole lot else
you can do.Tell me something.Who gets through this gate
into the United States?I don't know. American citizens?Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.- How do I decide?
- I don't know.I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.If I don't, they don't.- Anything you don't understand?
- No.I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?Well, I got an overcoat on.- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion,August 7th, 1966,
July 2nd, 1968.- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.- I need everything else.
- OK.Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?No, sir. It's unusual.<i>- [WOMAN] She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.</i><i>- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care,</i>and don't you
hang up this phone.<i>Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.</i><i>- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.</i><i>- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?</i>I don't know. I had the sheriff
here from Terrell County. He...<i>- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?</i><i>- You're hurt, ain't you?
- [SCOFFS]</i>What makes you say that?<i>- I can hear it in your voice.
- [WOMAN] It's falseness in his voice!</i>Look, I want you to meet me at the
Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money,he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.<i>Find who? What am I
supposed to do with mother?</i><i>- She'll be all right.
- All right?</i><i>[WOMAN] Be all right?
I got the cancer!</i>Ain't nobody gonna bother her.[MAN GURGLES]- [GURGLING CONTINUES]
- Hmm.Who are you?- Me?
- Yes.Nobody.Accounting.He gave the Mexicans a receiver.He feels...He felt that
the more people looking...That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.I see.Are you going to shoot me?That depends.Do you see me?[WOMAN] I always seen this
is what it'd come to.Three years ago,
I pre-visioned it.It ain't three years
we been married.Three years ago I said them
very words, "no" and "good."Here we are, 90 degree heat,I got the cancer and look at
this, not even a home to go to.We're going to El Paso, Texas.You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.[MAN SPEAKS SPANISH][SPEAKS SPANISH]- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.You just set there. I'll get
tickets and a cart for the bags.You need help
with the bags, madam?Well, thank God, there is one
gentleman left in west Texas.Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?Oh...<i>[SHERIFF] Carla Jean,
how are you?</i>Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?<i>Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...</i>[CHUCKLES] Um...True story. I couldn't
swear to every detail,<i>- but it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.</i>Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just youwho goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.<i>- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.</i>He never thinks he needs any.<i>Carla Jean, I will not
harm your man.</i><i>And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.</i>What's the problem there,
neighbor?Yep, that'll suck some power,
over time.- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.Just lightin' out for
the territories, huh?[LAUGHS] Brother, I been there.Well, there's airstrips.The airport is El Paso.If you want someplace specific,you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.You gonna clamp them, buddy?Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?What are you talking about?Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?Yeah, that's me.I got beers in my room.- Oh, uh, I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.That's who you keep
looking out the window for?- Well, half.
- What else then?- Just looking for what's comin'.
- [WOMAN] Yeah.But no one ever sees that.Beer! That's what's comin'.I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.No, ma'am, I know
what beer leads to.[LAUGHS]Beer leads to more beer.[RAPID GUNFIRE]- [MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH]
- [TIRES SQUEALING][WOMAN SOBBING][WOMAN SCREAMS][WOMEN CRYING]You all right?Call the police.[SPEAKS SPANISH]Your local law enforcement.I'm not on their radio.[MAN] I met his
daughter at the...[GASPING, SOBBING]Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.Those hombres
would have taken the stash.I suppose so.Though they was
leavin' in a hurry.It's all the goddamn money,
Ed Tom. Money and the drugs.It's just goddamn
beyond everything.What's it mean?
What's it leading to?You know, if you'd have
told me 20 years agoI'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas townswith green hair,
bones in their noses,I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.Signs and wonders.But I think once you quit
hearing "sir" and "ma'am,"the rest is soon to foller.- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.Not the one thing.Yeah, well, none of that
explains your man, though.Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?Well, sometimes I think
he's pretty much a ghost.- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?Yeah. All of that over at the Eagle Hotel?
Just beyond everything.Yeah. Got some
hard bark on him.Why... Well, that don't
hardly say it.He shoots a desk clerk one day,walks right back in the next and
shoots a retired Army colonel.It's hard to believe.Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?Well, good trip, Ed Tom.Sorry we couldn't
help your boy.[ENGINE SHUTS OFF][SIGHS][SIGHS][AIRPLANE FLIES OVERHEAD][CATS MEOW]- [MAN] In back!
- How'd you know I was here?Who else'd be driving up
in your truck?- You heard it?
- How's that?Did you hear my...?
You're having fun with me.What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.How'd you know
it was my truck?I deduced it
when you walked in.How many of them
things you got now?Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got."Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.I got to say,
you're looking older.I am older.Got a letter from your wife.She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.[INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY]- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.How fresh is that coffee?I generally make a fresh pot every
week, even if there's some left over.That man that shot you
died in prison?Angola. Yeah.What'd you done
he'd a been released?Oh, I don't know. Nothing.Wouldn't be no point in it.Kindly surprised
to hear you say that.Well, all the time
you spend trying to get backwhat's been took from you,
more is going out the door.After a while, you have to try
to get a tourniquet on it.Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?I don't know.I feel overmatched.I always figured
when I got older,God would... sort of
come into my life somehow.And He didn't.And I don't blame Him.If I was Him, I'd have the same
opinion of me that He does.You don't know what He thinks.I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster
and badge over to the Rangers,put it in their museum.Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.Well, they was ahead of him.Shot him in his doorway.Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.They just sat there on their
horses, watching him die.After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.Left out.Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.Shot through the left lung.And that was that...
as they say.When'd he die?Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?No, I mean, was it right away
or in the night or...- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.What you got ain't nothin' new.This country is hard on people.You can't stop what's coming.It ain't all waitin' on you.That's vanity.I knew this wasn't done with.I ain't got the money.What little I had is long gone and
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.I wouldn't worry about it.I need to sit down.You got no cause to hurt me.No. But I gave my word.- You gave your word?
- To your husband.That don't make sense.You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.Not like that.Not like you say.You don't have to do this.People always say
the same thing.What do they say?They say,
"You don't have to do this."- You don't.
- [SIGHS] OK.This is the best I can do.Call it.I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.- Call it.
- No.I ain't gonna call it.Call it.The coin don't have no say.It's just you.Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.[RATTLING][BOYS CHATTERING]- [GLASS CLATTERING]
- [GROANING][BREATHING HEAVILY][GROANING]Mister, you got a bone
sticking out of your arm.I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.All right.Are you all right? You got
a bone sticking out your arm.What'll you take for the shirt?- [SIRENS APPROACHING]
- [PANTING]Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.Look at that fucking bone.Tie this for me.Just tie it, just tie it.- [SIRENS APPROACHING]
- [EXHALES]Hell, mister. Look, I don't mind
helping someone out.- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.Take it and...
you didn't see me.- I was already gone.
- [SIRENS APPROACHING]Yes, sir.- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.I mean, would you
care to join me?Lord, no, I'm not retired.- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... better not.- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?They always is
to the party concerned.Ed Tom, I'll be polite.All right, then. Two of 'em, both had
my father in 'em. It's peculiar.I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.So, in a sense,
he's the younger man.Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,but it was about
meeting him in town,somewheres,
and he give me some money.I think I lost it.Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.And I was a-horseback, going
through the mountains of a night.Going through this pass
in the mountains.It was cold, and there was
snow on the ground.And he rode past me
and kept on going,never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.He had his blanket wrapped
around him and his head down.When he rode past, I seen he was
carrying fire in a horn,the way people
used to do, and I...I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,'bout the color of the moon.And, in the dream,
I knew that he was......going on ahead.He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.And I knew that whenever
I got there, he'd be there.And then I woke up.

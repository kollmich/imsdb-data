I was put here to kill.You were too,
whether you know it or not.We kill because it solves problems,because after all the options
have been exhaustedand everything else fails,we have one way to solve problems.And that's why we're here.That's not why I'm here.I'm here to protect our troops,
to protect our interests.I was put here to help create
a democracy, to enforce justice.Yeah? And how do you do that?You do that with this, this right here.After everything else fails,
it all comes down to this, baby.This is justice. Power is justice.Killing solves problems,
That seems like the solution.It's called right and wrong.Does not compute.Where does right and wrong
factor in to this place?You tell me - what difference
does right and wrong make here?Shit, man, right and wrong
only matters where it has impact.There's always a right and wrong,
as long as you have the choice.You ain't got no choice here.
Only choice is living or dying.Going through life without a choice
is like driving without the headlights on.Hey, hey, hey, quit fucking around, man.What's the point of seeing
when you can't steer anyway?Fuck you. Turn the lights on.Fuck you.
Fuck you!Turn the fucking lights on.
You don't know what's out there.No, no, no, no, no, you don't stop.
You do not stop!I just hit a fucking kid.You don't stop for anything at night.What the fuck was that?
It was a fucking kid.What's a kid doing in the desert?I don't give a fuck
if you just hit your grandmother.You do not sidestep protocol.
You do not stop for anything at night!What if he's still alive?
Bailey's right.You're not supposed to stop,
it's the rules. It could be an ambush.You put this piece of shit in gear and go.
That's an order!Fuck you. I'm doing the right thing.Kill those goddamn floods.
Kill those goddamn floods!Kill those fucking lights.
Kill those fucking lights right now!That's just who he was.He pulled four people out of there
and then tried to put the pin back in.He tried to
put the pin back in?I didn't know you could do that.Apparently you can.Did you know
he was working on an opera?Barthenoy's many friends,some of whom
have gathered here today,suggested that he was a man
who loved his countryand gave his life
protecting not only our freedoms,but the lives of his fellow soldiers -in essence, doing God's work.Barthenoy was not only thoughtful,a responsible and a loving man,
but a hero.He is an example for us all.But although he is a hero,Barthenoy had not yet clarified
his spiritualityand his relationship with Jesus.Well, Jesus said, "I am the way,
the truth and the life."No man cometh unto the Father
but by me,ÂJohn 1436.Had Barthenoy the opportunity
to look into the futureand predict his own untimely passing,a passing which, because of his youth,
is perhaps more tragic than most,one wonders if this burden
would have been left unfinished.And so now is the time for us
to look into our own livesand ask the question,have we embraced the path
of the righteous?And if not, how long should we wait?Until we are sick?Until we are facing death ourselves?Or until we stand before God in heaven
asking for atonement?For none of us,
except Lord Jesus Christ,none of God's children
can see their futuresand none can live forever here on Earth.MAN. Did you check the gas?Check the gas?That gauge don't work.
You gotta use the stick.Gas is all out.Here's to Bart.To Bart.
To Bart.Is it just me, or was that priest guy...Minister...was that minister saying
that Bart was going to hell?Joey!
I'm not saying that he is.I'm just...I'm just saying
that the minister,His whole gig was that, you know,"Unless you accept Lord Jesus Christ
as your only saviour,"you're not going to heaven.ÂWhatever. Heaven's just
a Christian recruiting tactic.Wiccas believe that after deathone's spirit leaves one's bodyand transcends time and spaceand becomes part of a greater divinity
of nature, Mother Earth.Now, does that just work for witches?Or can mere mortals get in too?It works for everyone, even assholes.Perfect. I'm an asshole!Do you think he joined the military
to get away from me?What?
No, honey,i mean, seriously, do you think
he was trying to get out of marrying me?No.
No.No, I do not.In fact, I think he was building up
his courage to ask you.Really?Really, I do.He even had me looking at rings for him
so that he'd be ready to ask you.YouÂre an assholeI'm sorry. I'm just...Don't, Don't apologise.Like, this is...none of this seems real.How do you do it?How do you stay so strong?
You seem so strong.My inner strength is, um,a manifestation of my rigorous regimen
of heavy sedation.What...
Pills.Lot of pills.Vicodin. Valium. All the 'V's.I actually cycle them with beer
or this little fella right here,Vicodin.
Yeah?Can I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.Um, I can get you more
and whatever you need.Thanks.
OK?Oh, fuck. I just don't know
if I can make it.He was in all of my plans.We were gonna get a place
together...eventually.When he was ready.I know.And there was so much
I wanted to say to him.God, if I could just have......just one more day with him,just one more.It's gonna get easier.
it's gonna get better.OK? Just give it some time.I know, I know, I know.I know it will, and I'll meet someone else.But it...it won't be Bart.H won't be himYou know he never told me
he loved me?He never said it.
I told him, but he never said it to me.He did love you, He does, he did.He did love you.He did, he did love you, OK?OK? Yeah?Thank you.Oh.No. Oh, God.We can't do this.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.I don't want to make things worse.How can it get any worse?What the fuck?Oh!The sick...You're fucking kidding me.Fucking shit.This is...this is a dream.This is a dream.It's all just...all a nightmare.Just...wake up.Wake up. Fucking...fucking...Fuck!OK, just ride this shit out,
ride this shit out.This is...this is...This isn't real. This isn't real!Fuck! Fuck!Fuck.Come on.
Come on, please, wake up.Please wake up.Joey.Please wake up.Joey, Joey.Who is it?
It's me, man.Who's 'me'?
It's me, Bart.Let me in, please.Hilarious. Who is it?It's me, your friend, Bart.
Please let me in the door.Fuck off, douche-bag.It's fucking early in the morning
and this shit is not fucking funny.Jesus, fuck! What the fuck?
Who is that?OK, it's me.
I swear to God it's your friend.What the fuck? What the fuck?Who is that?
It's Bart.Please, open up, man.Fuck! Bart?It's me. It's Bart.Fuck!Get the fuck out of here!
OwlGet out of here, dude!
Fuck!Get out of here!
Jesus.What the fuck did you do that for?What the fuck is going on, dude?I don't fucking know, man.I don't know.You're supposed to be dead.So I gather.Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?I just need your help.
I'm not gonna hurt you.Oh, God, this is just a dream,
this is just a fucking dreamand I gotta fucking wake up.Wake up. Wake up, wake up right now.
Wake up.I tried that. It doesn't work.So it's not a dream.
So I'm fucking insane.That's it. I'm fucking...
I lost my mind.Maybe we're insane communally,
together.And if I'm insane, that means
you're not fucking here.But if you're insane...Fuck, you can't be fucking insane,
'cause you're fucking dead.Oh, God, fuck. How do you know
I'm not just fucking imagining you?I don't know the test for that, man.Let's just pretend that you're not insane,I'm actually alive and we're having
this fucking conversation, OK?That'd be more productive right now.Fuck, I feel like shit.
Yeah, but you look terrific.Oh, fuck! Look at your fucking eyes!Shit!Fuck, yeah, it's fucked up.
Look at them.Jesus! Fuck, that is not fucking cool!Nasty. Oh, fucking shit, you smell!Fuck, you got a fucking reek on you.
God!You're really making me feel a whole lot
better about this whole situation.You're fucking decomposing.
Jesus Christ, you're fucking rotting.Dude.This is not fucking happening, dude.
This is not fucking happening.I was at your funeral, man.About that - that was a mistake.I think I was buried alive.
No, dude.Yeah.
I fucking touched you, dude.You were fucking dead.
It was fucking cold.It was nasty...Fucking neighbours. Really?
Nothing changes.They're still doing that?
Yeah, still.- Fuck.
- Turn that thing down!My funeral, My fucking funeral.Really? Yeah.How's Janet?
She's fine.She's fine. I mean terrible.
Terrible, devastated.You know, destroyed.Um, and, you know,
she's just trying to deal.We all are. You know, we were nervous
when you went over there.We just wanted you to come back safe
and, you know, that..Your uncle Dave called
and was real nice.He told me, and then I had to
call and tell Janet,and she was just...But...but you're fucking here.
Fucking Jesus Christ!It's a fucking miracle, right?Jesus...
What's wrong? What's wrong?Everything- Yeah?I think it's my fucking liver, 'cause
I don't know anything about livers...We gotta fucking get you
to hospital, dude.Fucking... You are awful.
No.We gotta fucking find a doctor,
find out what's wrong with you.No doctors. it's just my stomach.
Your stomach?'Cause you fucking haven't eaten
in three weeks.I'm gonna go get you a snack.You want a fucking snack,
you got a snack, huh?I got pizza. it's cold, but, um,
you know, it's cold pizza.I can nuke it, 'cause it tastes better
if I throw it in the nuker.No, just bring it.
OK.You found the medicine cabinet.
Yeah.OK.Anchovies?
Yeah.Since when?
Just...That's disappointing.Oh! Fucking... Dude, that's my rug.Dr Forrest, dial 114, please.Dr Forrest, please dial 114,Buried alive?
Yeah.I was definitely, um...I was definitely buried.Um...it's the 'alive' part.I thought I was dead.
Everybody thought..You were deadHere, check this out.Do you have any STDs?
Syphilis, hepatitis, anything?I was killed to death in a gunfight.Can you lean forward for me, please?And just look straight ahead.I'm kind of decomposing.Can you take your shirt off for me,
please?I need you to cough and...
Sure.Military issue.What's the problem?
No, no, I can't explain!What's going on? What's going on?
Get down here!What is it? What's going on?Is it Bart? Barthenoy Gregory?Dude, cops. We gotta...We gotta go, There's cops.I think that this is maybe more
than just a bug.Fuck.What now, man?I know what I need to do.Smoke some dope.OK, uh, so you take the couch.
The couch is all yours.Um, yeah, and, you know, I think we just
gotta put a positive spin on this.You know what I mean?
Put it into a positive light.You know, in Korea,
the word for 'problem',Same word, 'opportunity'.So, really, we don't have a problem here.We have an opportunity.A gargantuan, fucked-up opportunity.We'll figure this all out tomorrow,
buttercup.Jesus!
Shit.Oh, Jesus!
Bart?Christ..Argh!
Oh, fuck, Bart.Fuck! Fuck, BadFuck! Bart! What the fuck, dude?Ban?Barf? Oh. JesusWhat the fuck is happening?Jesus. I just don't believe it.
I know, right?And what did the doctor say?We didn't really get
a reasonable diagnosis,God, it's unbelievable.Promise you're not gonna
tell anybody, right?No. I mean, yes, I swear.Not anybody - not Janet, not his mom,Not until we figure out, you know,
what's going on.So he's not breathing, right? I mean...Oh, God.
I couldn't find a pulse.This is disgusting,
Yeah.Like, he smells dead, at least.So, why don't you want to tell Janet?I don't want to tell nobody nothing,
not till we figure out what the fuck.So what's the prognosis?Well. his aura looks like shit.Oh, his aura looks like...Is he dead?
Yeah, he's dead.Dead dead?
Doornail dead.What the fuck?He was walking around,
puking up blood,being a general pain in the ass
not four fucking hours ago.And then he just arrested?
Arrested?Died.
Oh.Maybe, like, his vital signs are so low
he just appears to be dead,He's been embalmed, Joey.So...what do we do?Chop off his head.
What?!You have to chop off his head
and drive a stake through his heart.Why would I do that?Because he's undeadUndead?He's a vampire.A vampire!Yes, Joey, a vampire,
a creature of the night.And tonight he'll probably
come back again from death.A vampire? You're a fucking idiot.
What's wrong with you?Joey, I'm serious.
Yeah, I'm serious, Matty.You're a fucking retard, OK?There's a science explanation
for what's happening here.OK, like what?
Like he's sick.He has a virus. Gulf War syndrome.Joey, I'm a nurse.
He died over a month ago.We buried him two days ago,
What does this look like to you?OK. Alright.Vampires have fangs, right?Look, huh?Eugh, gross.No fangs.Maybe they take some time to grow in.Yeah, maybe your theory is shit
'cause he died, like, a month ago,OK, so what's he doing on your floor?
I don't know.That's what I called you for.You have to chop off his head.
OK, or else?Or else, Joey, he'll roam the countrysidein search of victims to satiate
his thirst for human blood.This is ludicrous, OK?He's not a vampire. He's a dead guy.I'm gonna take him to the mortuary
and let the morticians deal with him.Alright, do what you want.
it's not my problem.But if they don't chop off his head,
he will be back.Oh, my God, where I live,
on planet Earth,there's no such thing as vampires.You know, believe what you want,but when he rises again and starts
taking the lives of the innocent,the blood will be on your hands.It's up to you, Joey.
He will need to drink human blood.If he doesn't, his soul will be
in eternal agony.If you're really his friend, you'll put
his soul to rest and chop off his head,Mathilda, not a word to anyone.
Promise me!I promise, I do. Kisses.Holy shit, dude.
You scared the piss out of me.Fuck. Why am I so stiff?I usually say that in the morning too.Was I asleep?
You were dead.Hey, your hanging-over favourite, huh?Eggs, smoked oysters

You got a security pass?Yeah, Yeah, absolutely.Got a security pass.OK, OK, I don't want to hurt you, ma'am.I just want some blood.
Oh, here we go.OK. What type?What?
What blood type?I...I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Just hurry up, please,What are you using it for?
Hey, that's none of your business.I'm a nurse. Of course it's my business.I can't indiscriminately dole out
pints of bloodto every strung-out buffoon
who wanders in off the street.Someone could get the wrong type
and blam, that's it.So, what blood type?No, just...just give me
some fucking blood, lady, OK?And hurry up,
or I'll give you a bullet sandwich.Good. Good.Thank you.We get your type in here

This is real surreal. You feel good?Oh!
Whoa! Whoa! Not nice.Yeah, girl. Working girl, right?
Yeah, yeah.We should do this more.You know, we didn't do this enough
when you were alive.I feel like I've fucking...I feel like I've been
given a second chance.You have been.
Nobody gets a second chance, nobody.No... I-I got a second chance
and I'm gonna fucking use it.I'm gonna do it the way
I shoulda done it the first time.There you go.And no mistakes.
No mistakes.No regrets.
No surrender.Because I'm fucking alive, my man.
God bless you.Fuck.God. God.Oh, hi, Joey. How are you?Hey, Mrs Agmanic.AhIs that Bart?
it's Bart.He's...he's...
Yeah, he's real sleepy.He's been doing...
He's drinking, so...Is he drunk?
Yeah.Burning the candle at both ends.I can help if you...
No, no, I'm OK, Mrs Agmanic.You'll hurt his head.
Yeah, he's asleep.He fell asleep in the car, you know.
I'll bring you some...He's sleepy, I don't wanna wake him.
I'll bring you orange juice-No, thank you.
I'll bring you coffee.OK, Mrs Agmanic.God. Alright, get you down here.Come on, baby. Ahh.Oh, fuck him, alright.No? Not...not even a tingle?
This is stupid.OK, alright.
No, let's just experiment.Alright, so the crucifix
doesn't work.Hold out your hands.
Joey!This is actual holy water, OK.An actual Catholic priest
blessed this shit right in front of me,Please, just hold out your hands.
No, this is ridiculous.This is ridiculous, OK?
This whole thing is fucking ridiculous.Hold your hand out.OK.Well?
Oh, fuck.That's not wat..
What the fuck is...Holy shit!What the fuck?!Oh, my God! Oh, my God!Fuck, Bart, I'm fucking sorry, dude.
Oh, my God!Why did you do this?!
Fuck. What do I do?What's wrong?
Why did you pour water on my hand?It didn't do shit.
Oh, you fucking asshole.Such an asshole, manWho was stroking your hair last night
when you were drinking blood?You were, yeah.
Human blood. Fuck it.Look, alright, OK, OK,
I did some research,and you're either
a zombie or a vampire,Good. Zombie or a vampire.I knew there had to be
a scientific explanation for this.Well... Look, we basically
categorise you as definitely undead.Alright, There's one catch, Joey.There's no such thing
as vampires or zombies.Not according to the internet.
God, the internet.What do they say about Bigfoot
on the internet?Bart, you're clearly not Bigfoot-
you're way too short,you're not covered in hair,
your feet are too small.OK, OK, alright.
So, zombie, check this out."A zombie is a dead human
or animal corpse"that has been resuscitated
from death"by virtue of a curse, plague
or other unnatural cause."Huh? Huh? Who does that
sound like, right?"Zombies are automatons with
little to no mental functions," - you -"limited reasoning power," - you -"and virtually no innate drive,Â - again,
you -"aside from the urge to feed on
the flesh or brains of the living."So I'm a zombie.
No.Horst in 'Schriften und Hypothesen Uber
die Vampyren' defines a vampire as"a dead body which continues
to live in the grave,"which it leaves, however, by night"for the purpose of sucking
the blood of the living,"whereby it is nourished,
preserved in good condition,"instead of becoming decomposed
like other dead bodies.ÂAnd Scoffern in 'Stray Leaves
of Science And Folklore' writes,"The best definition
I can give of a vampire"is a living, mischievous
and murderous dead body."A living dead body.ÂSo I'm a vampire.You're a revenant.
A revenant?One who returns from the dead
in corporeal form.Yeah. Yeah, that's me.So, what the hell do you do -drink holy water and recite
the Lord's Prayer backwards, what?There is, er, one..,one cureand that is chopping off your headand driving a stake
through your body.Well... Oh, fuck!Fuck.So, what are we gonna do?Here we go, here we go.Here we go.Hey, man, how you doing, huh?Hey, man, we got
some work for you. Hop in.Oh, thank you very much, sir,but how about just some money
so I can buy some food?Please don't touch the car.
We'll give you some food, OK?So come on in, we got food for you.
Oh...no, man. Thanks.How about just a dollar, maybe $2.
OK.Well, here's the thing - your sign says
you will work for food.So we've got work for you,
then we're gonna give you some food -you'll work for food.You understand what I mean?
So come on in.Hey, man, I'm just trying
to make ends meet, you know.So you will work for food?
Money would be better.I mean, I'm just trying
to make things happen,and kind of burn the candle
at both ends.Burn the candle at both ends?
Burn the candle at both ends.So whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's revisit this for a moment OK?What do you mean 'missed'?
You want me to kill them?These are the dregs of society.They have no jobs, no family,
you know what I'm saying?They make no contribution whatsoever.You think someone's gonna noticeif they don't show up
at the freeway exit ramp one day?I'm not killing anybody.
You gone fucking crazy?You know what, maybe I am crazy.You show up, come back
from the dead magically,soliciting my help to procure
human blood so you don't rot.Yeah, crazy -
reasonable explanation,Here we go, filthy meal coming up.Hey, there, pops,
got some work for you for food.Oh, yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.Why don't you hop in, OK?
How about some money, man?Give me some money.
No, no, no, no.We have food for you
if you work for us, like the sign says -you know, the sign
that you're holding?What?
The sign.What?
"Will work for food."Who the fuck do you think I am,
your nigger?!Oh, wow.
Get outta the car, white boy!Alright, alright. Alright.
Outta the car! Put them up.OKHey, will you work for food?I don't do that shit, man.

at its previous place of employmenton September 17,
two months after initial death.That night at the morgue -
and this is typical-it resumed its animated state.They called local authorities
who subdued it,who then contacted the WHO.DNA samples revealed this to bethe body of a man who died
more than 14 weeks ago.Subject 984240.Cutting off the heads during the day
when they are inanimateHas been sufficient, in most cases,
to keep the subject from rising again.Subject 687002.After testing on four subjects,it was found that impalement alone
often does not prevent reanimation.However, when used in conjunction
with decapitation,seems to ensure permanent death.Now, decapitation has
an interesting effectwhile they're in the animated state.This subject, 991560,
was decapitated four days agoduring the night while it was animate
and the head still fully functioned.Well, it seemed to be fully aware.Now, short of incinerating the head,
we don't know how to discharge it.Uh, how is the infection transmitted?We've not been able to show
any known aetiologies for this condition,No-one's been able to isolate
a viral or bacterial infectionthat would facilitate transmission.DNA testing has shown
no genetic predispositionfor post-modem reanimationWe are looking at something
completely new.Completely new?
Completely ancient.Subject 9890052His corpse went missing
from the mortuary embalming roomfor nine weeks.We just recovered him this morning.He might be the alpha infection subject,meaning we don't know
how many others he might've infected.And he's military.Well, the lab results

from last year#I remember you standing there#Just like the photo I took#That I cannot look at anymore#Stacked in shoeboxes by the fire#Awaiting their destruction at my hands#Empty shoeboxes burning higher#Burning, blowing ashes in the sand#And if I find you#Waiting here for me#When I get back home#And if I find you waiting#Waiting on the other side#With Kool-Aid and your Pumas#And you just arrived#But you know
that you've been here before#So pull out your knife#And carve your steaming carcass
on the floor.  #

with that husband of hers.MARGARET: Frank. He has a name.
Frank.And he's always been
very nice to you.He makes me nervous.There's a lot of reasons why I can't go.
Mom.Honey,I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.It was never that important to me.
It was just something I did.When are you gonna realize how
special it was, how much it all meant?I...Yeah, I know how
you feel. I really do.But you're going.Car.A car, a train, a bus. I'm tired already.

go ahead.Mr. Harvey,I hit 487 home runs

- She taught me.My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
Vinnie's Dance Girls Deluxe.She was one of the dancers,
I was a bouncer.MAE:
All right, let's go.You were great!Thanks for the ride, kid.
What's your rush, dollbody?What do you say we slip in the back
seat and you make a man out of me?What do you say
I smack you around for a while?Can't we do both?I'm not hot. It's fine.
That's the one I like right there.Brr. It's really cold. Ooh.That's better.
Where's Kit? Hi.I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.MAN 1:
I got my truck parked outside.Kit. Hey.Sorry, we gotta go. Come on.
Alice, come on.Guys, we gotta go.

her liquor. I'm saying...All right, you guys go ahead.
I'll get Marla.WOMAN:

WOMAN: Hurry up, ladies!Thanks.âª Nobody else gave me a thrill âªâª With all your faults
I love you still âªâª It had to be you âªâª Wonderful you
It had to be you âªâª It had to be you âªMarla?Marla, honey? We gotta go.
Come on.I'm singing to Nelson!
Ain't I, baby?You sure are.- Marla, come on.

MARLA: Ain't he something?âª Could make me be blue âªâªThat's the second time he dropped
that Bible since she's been in there.Come on, girls.- Mae, what'd you say?
MAE: Everything."Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.Managing girl ballplayers.You just go out there and you
wave your little hat around.Don't drink!"Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!Double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl."But be nice to them.They're good ballplayers."Unh! There, catch that,
blondie! Ha-ha-ha!ANNOUNCER: Now batting

Keep your eye on it, Marla.What are you, stupid?DORIS:
Somebody's gotta run the team.Someone who actually watches the games.You're gonna squeeze bunt
with our best hitter?What's the sign to swing away?Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.Stop thinking with your tits,
you want a big inning. Batter!Time!Come on!Hey, who is the goddamn
manager here? I am!Then act like it, you big lush!DORIS: Ho-ho-ho! You tell him, Dottie!

Put it by her.Way to go,
whatever your name is!Good bluff!Eh? But I still say
you're not ballplayers.Cemetery boneyard! Cross your fingers
or you'll never get another hit.MAE:
Sound it out.Kimono.Kimono off and...gra-bed...Grabbed.her...milky-- Milky...white-- Milky white...What are you giving her to read?What's the difference?
She's reading.That's the important thing.
Now go away! Go! Shoo!- Go ahead, Shirley. You're doing good.
SHIRLEY: Thanks.Okay.Milkywhite...breasts.It gets really good
after that. Look.A delivery boy walks in.
What you doing?[WHISPERING]
Oh, I'm writing a song.- Really? What's it about?
- Yeah.About us.ELLEN SUE:
Could you teach it to me?BETTY: Doris, is this your boyfriend?
DORIS: Yup.- Is it out of focus?
- No, that's how he looks.Looks aren't
the most important thing.Right. The important thing is he's
stupid, out of work and treats me bad.Then why...?- Why? What do you think?
- Becausenone of the other boys ever...Always made me feel like
I was wrong, you know?Like I was some sort of a
weird girl or a strange girlor not even a girl,
just because I could play.I believed them too.
But not anymore, you know?I mean, look. There's a lot of us.I think we're all all right.We are.Hey, give me that.So long, Charlie!ANNOUNCER: So with two runs
in the 6th, South Bend gets even.STILWELL: I've gotta go! I've gotta go!
WOMAN: We'll get it back.You shake it off. Shake it off.Say, Evelyn, can I ask you
a question? You got a moment?Mm-hm.Which team do you play for?- Well, I'm a Peach.
- Well, I was just wonderingbecause I couldn't figure out why
you'd throw homewhen we've got a 2-run lead!You let the tying run get on second,
and we lost the lead!You start using your head!That's that lump that's three feet
above your ass!Are you crying?- No.
- Are you crying?Are you crying?!There's no crying!There's no crying in baseball!- Why don't you leave her alone?
- Oh, you zip it, Doris!Rogers Hornsby, my manager,
called me a "talking pile of pig shit"!That was when my parents
came from Michigan- to see me play the game! Did I cry?
- No, no.- No! No! Do you know why?
- No.Because there's no crying in baseball.
There's no crying in baseball!No crying!UMPIRE: What's the matter, Jimmy?
- She's crying, sir.I didn't mean to do that.Perhaps you chastised her
too vehemently.Good rule of thumb: Treat each of
these girls as you would your mother.Anyone ever tell you you look
like a penis with a hat on?You're out of here!- I heard that!
- You misunderstood.- Ten seconds!
- You misunderstood!You can't throw me out
knowing you've got a strike zone...Off this field!- Get in that dugout! Get off this field!
- You're out.I can't believe no one ever
called you that before!That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.All right, who's up here?
Who's up?ANNOUNCER: The crowd's light today,
what with the tractor show in town.If you're nearby, and you must be,
since this isn't a powerful radio station,come on down to the ballpark
and bring the kiddies.People better start showing up.We don't have fans,
we don't have a league.Ladies, you all look wonderful.

WOMAN 2: LIFE magazine?Don't waste your time, Doris.ALICE: We get that in Saskatchewan.
Dottie,I'm trying to get them to do
a story about you.Me? Why me?You're the "Queen of Diamonds."
That's what I'm calling you.Did you tell them about me?I told them how at first,
the scout didn't even want you,but how Dottie wouldn't come
without her kid sister.They loved it. They really loved it.A real human-interest story.So will you just try to give them
something spectacular out there?Anything.Why, what's the matter?Well, Mae,
we're not doing so well.Harvey and the other owners
think they've made a mistake.They're talking about
closing you down.- What?
- What are you talking about?They can't close us down here.- What kind of a thing is that?
- What's it mean?They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.And what am I supposed to do,
huh?Go back to taxi dancing?Ten cents so some slob
can sweat gin all over me?I'm never doing that again.So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man
that he ain't closing me down!They can't keep us from playing!KIT:
We'll show them how we play.I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.So will you just give them

I'm in a goddamn circus!A triple. A double
would be nice--All right!God knows we have a game.It's not like any of this helps,
believe me.Safe!That was really nice!All right, all right.
Let's go, girls.Dozens of people are waiting
for the game to start.Yeah!Batter!What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!- Beverly.
JIMMY: Beverly!Look sharp, tall--
What is her name again?DOTTIE: Beverly.
- Beverly. Good. Good.Yeah! Five bucks!
Five bucks!What if, at a key moment in the game,
my uniform bursts openand, oops, my bosoms

- Dairy assistant manager.He's gonna be manager
someday. He's real smart.So he's good-looking and smart.There's so few of us.Where did you say
he was again? Italy?Yeah, I think. I haven't got a letter
from him in three weeks.I used to get one every week.Well, that doesn't mean anything.If he's in combat, it's not like
there's a mailbox on every corner.Besides, if something happened,
you would've got a telegram.- Oh, God, don't--
- But he's fine. No, he's fine.How come you're not in the Army?I have no cartilagein my knee. Not that you
need cartilage to shoot Nazis.You need this, right?
Trigger finger. I could do that.Heh. Right.How did I get so useless so fast?- Boys really like this on your fingers?
- It works for me.Your sister's not gonna be mad?[WHISPERS]
I don't care.Listen, when, uh...- Bob.

- Sure.You play like you love it.No. No.- Does he know how good you are?
- Bob?No, Hitler. Yes, Bob.How good am I?You stink.You're lousy.You're only the best player in the league.
You don't know that?Well...You ever been married?Well, let me think. Yeah, twice.Any children?One of them was, yeah, yeah.- Is she out?

Fair ball!Time!ANNOUNCER: Jimmy Dugan pops his
head out of the dugout.He's on his way to talk to his hurler.Kit Keller looks mighty tired.Game's getting pretty exciting.I'll finish it right here.I'll strike this turkey out.Betty's ready to come in.Come on. I've never been
taken out before.Ask Dottie.I really wanna finish this game,
Jimmy. Please?What do you think?Well, you know, she's battling.What do you think?She's done.
She's throwing grapefruits.- Blue!
ANNOUNCER: Oh!It looks like Keller's coming out of the
game, and she is not happy about it!MAN:
Nice job, Kit!ANNOUNCER: Betty Horn sprints in
from the left-field bullpen.Look at this crowd. This is great.
They're jumping, hopping, cheeringand they paid to get in.You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.But to be perfectly honest, I think
the girls deserve most of the credit.Oh, they're great.Fortunately, we won't need
them anymore. Do you want a peanut?No. What do you mean?What do you mean,
what do I mean?We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.Roosevelt himself said,
"Men's baseball won't be shut down."So we won't need
the girls next year.Bases loaded. Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up 6 to 2. Two men out.- No balls, 2 strikes.
DOTTIE: Okay, Betty, right here.UMPIRE:
Strike 3!ANNOUNCER: And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!I love these girls. I don't need them,
but I love them.Look at that. Come on.
Let's go.Oh, look at me. I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.This is what it's gonna be like
in the factories too, I suppose."Men are back. Turn in your rivets."We told them it was their patriotic
duty to get out and go to work.When the men come back,
they're sent back to the kitchen.Should we send the boys returning
from war back to the kitchen? Come on.Excuse me.Do you know how dedicated
they are? What they go through?They play with sprained ankles,
broken fingers.They ride a bus all night to play
a double-header the next morning.I'll make it up to them.What? With Harvey Bars?I'm getting tired of
listening to you, Ira.I'd like your permission
to take over the league.What?Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.There's no point to it anymore.Just let them finish the season,
and that's it!I sold your product when there
was no product. This is a product!There is no room for
girls' baseball in this countryonce the war is over.They're through.I think you're wrong.And I'm gonna prove it
to you, Mr. Harvey!Hi, my name's Mae. That's more
than a name, that's an attitude.Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.PHOTOGRAPHER:
Smile for the camera.- Thank you, Mae.
- You're the best.The game put us in the playoffs.
I could have finished.Stilwell could've hit off you.What's the matter? Too big
to finish your own games now?Hey!Don't start with me, Kit.
Don't you start with me. Don't start!DOTTIE:
Kit, come on, cut it out!DORIS:
What the hell are you doing?!WOMAN 1: Hey, you guys.
DORIS: Get off of me!WOMAN 2: Jimmy!
WOMAN 3: Stop it!Get off of her.- Get your sister off of her!
- Stay out of it Mae!You stay out of it!
Doris!KIT:
You just wait, Doris!Let me down!Let me down! Ow!You stay down there
and you cool off!Why'd she do it?She was vulnerable.
You provoked her.Shut up, Helen!
You're making her more upset.Really!I don't need it from Helen too.
Take a shower.Leave me. I'm not taking a shower.
She reminds me of my husband.DOTTIE:
Save some hot water for me,
you guys.You okay?My rear end hurts
where Jimmy dropped me.You acted like a baby out there.
You treat me like a baby.I treated you like a pitcher
who'd lost her stuff.When Betty's in trouble,
you nurse her.Every pitch,
you're backing her up!I seem to remember last weeksomebody throwing
a rosin bag in my face.Told me to get my fat ass behind
the plate. Was that you or the umpire?KIT:
You could've
backed me up todayinstead of holding me back.I hold you back?It's like at home.It's like if you're here,
then I'm not here.What does that mean?I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that. I just-- You--I just get so mad!Why do you gotta be
so good, huh?Hey, Kit.Kit.Ah, Dottie, there you are.
You weren't on the bus.Could I speak to you a minute?I have to leave.Oh. Don't worry. The bus
wouldn't leave without you.No. I'm going home.
I'm leaving the team.What?- Why? What--
- I have to go home.Home? You can't go home
now. No, it--This couldn't come at a worse time.You see, we're in a bit of a crisis,
and I have to try to pull something off.It's not a good time to lose
our most popular player.What's the problem?
Maybe I can help.I don't wanna talk about it.It's personal?It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?No. Kit, that's it. I've noticed
there's some friction.That's fine. That's no problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.I can arrange a trade.Like Racine? Kenosha?
South Bend?Trade me or whatever.But figure it out by tomorrow.
Otherwise, I'm going home.Tomorrow? Fine! I'll work
everything out by tomorrow.You really gave me a scare
there for a second.Hey, does anybody have
any extra hose?Does anybody have any extra hose?
Mae, your date's here.- How do I look?
- Where'd you get that dress?- Borrowed it.
- It don't fit. It's too tight.I don't plan on wearing it that long.I don't know why
you get dressed at all.[ON RADIO]
âª Choo choo, ch-boogie
Take me right back to the track âªâª- Where's Dottie?
- In there.WOMAN 1:
Wanna go to the movies with me?WOMAN 2:
You wanna go with me?KIT: You bitch!
- What?I've been traded to Racine!You? I told them to trade me.Oh, yeah, they'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.You knew what was gonna happen!DOTTIE:
I didn't!WOMAN 1:
This'll be better than the movies.I'll quit. ls that what you want?
Then they'll blame me for you quitting!What do you want me to do?Stay away from me. Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!Kit, listen to me.It was all a mistake, okay?
A big mistake.I was getting too good.
You won't listen.I knew if I did too good,
you'd do something to push me down!Blow it out your rear end! I'm sick
of being blamed for everythingbothering you.
I got you into this league![WHISPERING]
She got her in the league.I didn't even wanna be here!
Then why are you still here?Kit wants to know
why she's still playing.My train leaves at 8:00.
I got 10 minutes to pack.If you have trouble,
you know who to blame.KIT: I'll see you in the World Series.
DOTTIE: Yeah, you bet you will.DORIS: Don't look at her. Don't look.
Huh? Oh.Has anyone seen my new red hat?Oh, piss on your hat!Well, that seemed uncalled for.
STILWELL: Mommy!Just keep it down, okay?Kit's off our team.
WOMAN 3: She's not!DORIS:
Yes, she is. Are you deaf?Kit?Kit, you need any help in there?Don't act like this.

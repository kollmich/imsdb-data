OPERATOR #2: The line is busy.

00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:44,023
OPERATOR #3: Who is this?

00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,559
[All talking]

4
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,650
OPERATOR #4: I can connect you
with room service.

5
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,823
Hello.

6
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,776
Is that the clinic?
This is Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel.

7
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:03,789
How's my wife? Is she in pain?
Isn't the child coming soon?

8
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,123
Patience? Would you have patience?

9
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:10,545
This is Otto Kringelein.
Is that you, Heinrich?

10
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,290
Listen. I've got to talk very quickly.

11
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,673
Every minute costs 2 marks 90.

12
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,881
You know that will I made
before I had my operation?

13
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,799
I want you to tear it up.

14
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:26,685
I came to Berlin to see a great specialist
about that old trouble of mine, you know?

15
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,764
It's pretty bad,
and he says I haven't long to live.

16
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,903
[Shouting] I say, he says
I won't live much longer!

17
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,530
No, it isn't nice to be told things like that.

18
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:42,691
You plague, bother, and save,
and all of a sudden you're dead.

19
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,743
I want to get something out of life.

20
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:48,578
I'm never going back
to Friedersdorf. Never.

21
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,417
I'm staying here at the Grand Hotel.
It's the most expensive hotel in Berlin.

22
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:57,539
All the best people stay here.

23
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:01,425
Even our big boss, Preysing,
is staying here.

24
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:05,762
I'm going to tell him someday
just exactly what I think of him.

25
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:12,394
Hello, miss.

26
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:17,434
This is General Director Preysing.
I want my home in Friedersdorf, please.

27
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:19,099
Hurry.

28
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:25,151
Hello. Is that you, Mama?
How are the children?

29
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,608
What news have you
from the factory, dear?

30
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:31,701
Is your papa there? Good.

31
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:34,116
Hello, Papa, is that you?

32
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:39,627
The conference with the Saxonia company
is set for tomorrow morning, Papa.

33
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:45,501
If the merger does not go through,
we are in very bad shape, Papa.

34
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,471
Everything depends upon news
from Manchester.

35
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:54,805
If the deal with the Manchester
Cotton Company does not go through...

36
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:58,181
we're facing a very bad situation, Papa.

37
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:02,227
I'm Suzette, Mme. Grusinskaya's maid.
Madame will not dance today.

38
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:05,234
She will not go to the rehearsal.
She did not sleep all night.

39
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,395
There is something preying on her mind.

40
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:10,240
I gave her a tablet, a Veronal.
She's sleeping now.

41
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,364
This is Baron von Geigern.

42
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:16,365
Look here, I need money,
or I can't stay at this hotel much longer.

43
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:19,907
I've laid the groundwork.
I know the exact position of her room.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,241
I've made friends
with her ballet master, Pimenov.

45
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:26,747
Listen, Heinrich.
I've taken all my savings, everything...

46
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:29,881
and I’m going to enjoy spending it.
All of it.

47
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:34,887
It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
But it's wonderful.

48
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:38,631
I can't! I'll lose my job.
It's like being in jail.

49
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,476
Rely on me, Papa.
I will make this merger go through.

50
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,510
I never fail.

51
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:45,521
Poor Madame. Her mind is tortured.
I'm afraid she will...

52
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,145
I don't need advice, thanks very much.
I need money!

53
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:51,983
Music all the time. It's wonderful.

Nothing ever happens.

is not to be brought.

BELLBOY: Yes, Baron?

61

BARON: Adolphus is very vexed with you.
BELLBOY: Yes, Baron?

62
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,787
You didn't take him for his walk
this morning.

63
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,078
BELLBOY: The door was locked.
BARON: You should've knocked.

64
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,839
That's why they don't like little dogs
in big hotels.

65
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,377
The doors are locked.
They can't get out. You see?

66
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,921
- Yes, Baron.
- I want you to take him for a good walk.

67
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,255
- You understand?
- Yes, Baron.

68
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:07,179
- Don't bring him back till he's exhausted.
- No, Baron.

69
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:08,758
Wait a minute.

70
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,516
It's quite all right.

- Grusinskaya?

To tell the truth, Baron,
tonight we're a little bit nervous.

81
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:35,580
Were you at the theater last night?

82
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:37,741
I'm always there
when Grusinskaya dances.

- Last night was not so good.
- I thought she was splendid.

from Manchester.

ZINNOWITZ: No news?
PREYSING: No.

89

That's bad. You can't hold out unless
you merge with the Saxonia company.

90
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,473
- I know.
- The Saxonia company will never sign...

91
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:03,136
unless your firm is tied up
with the Manchester people.

92
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:04,809
They don't have to. I told you that.

93
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,360
Yes, I know. I'm very much worried.
But I have my agent in Manchester.

94
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,652
I'm expecting a telegram any minute.

95

You have to create a good impression.
Seem optimistic.

96
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:17,945
Don't even mention Manchester
to the Saxonia crowd. Be clever.

97
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,492
No, I cannot do that, Dr. Zinnowitz.

98
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:23,368
I'm used to making my deals
on a solid basis.

99
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,501
I'm an honest businessman,
a good husband and a father.

100
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:30,251
I have nothing to conceal.
I could not live happily otherwise.

101
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,877
Yes, I know.
We'll go someplace and talk it over.

for something...

CLERK: No, Doctor.

115

five bedrooms and two sitting rooms.

WOMAN: My mother, two sisters...

CLERK: Kindly wait one moment, please.

CLERK: Yes.

119

CLERK: You wish to have the rooms held?
WOMAN: Please. And then...

120
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:21,131
Really, I won't wait any longer.
I've been here a very long time.

121
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,844
That's all right.

122
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,841
Look here, I waited three days
before I got a room at all.

123
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:28,257
When I finally got one,
what kind of a room was it?

124
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:31,719
CLERK: A nice room, inexpensive.
OTTO: I didn't ask for a cheap room.

125
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,726
When I came here to live,
did I ask you for a cheap room? Did l?

OTTO: Every minute is precious.

129
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:48,491
I came to live here for two weeks,
maybe three. Heaven only knows.

130
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:52,906
I can pay whatever you want.
I'm tired and ill. I can't wait.

MANAGER: Do you have a complaint?
CLERK: He's dissatisfied with Room 559.

132
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:59,746
Yes, I have a complaint.
I think it's a perfectly fair complaint.

133
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:03,420
I came here from a great distance
to live at the Grand Hotel.

134
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,547
I want a room, a big room.

135
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:09,593
The same kind of room
you'd give General Director Preysing.

136
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:13,047
I'm as good as Mr. Preysing.

137
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:16,308
I can pay for a room
the same as Mr. Preysing.

138
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:19,644
Would you stick him way off
in a corner in a little room...

139
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:21,854
where the water pipes go "pop" all day?

140
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,767
He can have my room.
It doesn't matter where I stay.

141
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:27,272
That won't be necessary, Doctor.

142
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:31,312
Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176.
It's one of our most expensive rooms.

143
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:34,444
A large room on the front, and with a bar.

144
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:38,486
- With a private bar, exclusively mine.
- Certainly, sir.

145
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:41,535
Exactly what I want. That's very kind.
I'll pay for it now.

146
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,745
MANAGER: No, I beg of you, sir.
BARON: Pardon me, sir.

147
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,210
You dropped your little hat.

- Permit me.
- Thank you.

00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:36,810
- Actually...
- I mean, with the Manchester people.

616
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:40,512
Please, we are here to discuss the merger.
Let us begin at the beginning.

617
00:46:40,606 --> 00:46:41,720
PREYSING: Thank you.

618
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:43,475
Is Baron von Geigern in?

619
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,982
Too bad.

620
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:51,155
PREYSING: Since June 11 this year,
when the first negotiation...

621
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,438
I met him yesterday.

622
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:55,238
PREYSING: Between
our respective firms...

623
00:46:55,453 --> 00:46:56,567
I’ve got a date.

624
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:58,239
PREYSING: This merger can result...

625
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,824
About 5:00.

626
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:01,706
PREYSING: All of us.
FLAEMM: Dancing.

627
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:04,869
GERSTENKORN: Tell us about Manchester.
PREYSING: Just a second.

628
00:47:05,003 --> 00:47:07,494
Before I get through,
I’m laying before you here...

629
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:09,877
the last general statement of the concern.

630
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:12,670
The capital, the plant, the machinery...

631
00:47:12,802 --> 00:47:16,052
For instance, we'll take mop rags.

632
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,975
FLAEMM: I'll call back.
GERSTENKORN: Tell us about Manchester.

633
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:23,515
Yes, Mr. Preysing,
that's what we want to know.

634
00:47:23,603 --> 00:47:26,094
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz...

635
00:47:26,189 --> 00:47:28,893
before I commit myself, please.

636
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,561
Now, to go ahead with the merger.

637
00:47:34,405 --> 00:47:35,400
You realize...

638
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:40,151
that this merger is a great advantage
to the Saxonians, of course.

639
00:47:40,368 --> 00:47:42,361
Now, let's talk like adults.

640

- When you first approached us...
- We did not approach you.

641

MAN: This letter filed in September
exhibits you approached us.

642
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,246
That letter is a response
to a tentative feeler sent out by you.

643
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:54,164
Tentative, my foot!

644
00:47:54,256 --> 00:47:56,414
A month before this,
your old father-in-law...

645
00:47:56,508 --> 00:48:00,292
- comes to me privately, and scratches...
- Scratched?

646
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:03,222
PREYSING: We didn't take the initiative!
GERSTENKORN: You did...

647
00:48:03,306 --> 00:48:06,011
PREYSING: We did not!
GERSTENKORN: You did!

648
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,852
Gentlemen, I see the conference
has already begun.

649
00:48:08,936 --> 00:48:12,056
- I'm glad you're here, Justice Zinnowitz.
- Good morning.

650
00:48:13,232 --> 00:48:16,351
ZINNOWITZ: Thank you very much.
PREYSING: I beg your pardon, please.

651
00:48:17,736 --> 00:48:20,690
Excuse me, please. I am glad you're here.

652
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:25,105
These gentlemen have cross words.
Would you try, Justice Zinnowitz...

653
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:27,359
- and iron out the situation here?
- Certainly.

654
00:48:27,453 --> 00:48:29,576
- Right here, on the top.
- If you will allow me.

655
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:30,743
Thank you.

656
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:34,622
Well, gentlemen, the situation
seems to be perfectly clear.

657
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,913
- Yes. And how clear is Manchester?
- Manchester?

658
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:40,578
ZINNOWITZ: Have you said anything
about Manchester?

659
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:44,540
Why, no, sir. I cannot commit myself
at this time about Manchester.

660
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:49,178
Quite right. Well, gentlemen,
since June 11 of this year...

661
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,141
when the first negotiations for a merger
were entered...

662
00:48:52,226 --> 00:48:54,763
Now we're going to begin
at the beginning again.

663
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:56,810
As you remember it,
when you approached us...

664
00:48:56,897 --> 00:48:59,981
GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.
PREYSING: I'm sorry, you did!

665
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:02,142
GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.

666
00:49:02,235 --> 00:49:04,607
GERSTENKORN: You approached us!
ZINNOWITZ: Wait.

667
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:08,782
Can you imagine 100 girls
in a ballet school...

668
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:12,946
each thinking she would become
the most famous dancer in the world?

669
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,496
I was ambitious then.

670
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,372
We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.

671
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:27,294
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.

672
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:30,882
Then I became famous soon.

673
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:36,630
But why am I telling you all this?

674
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,966
Last night I didn't know you at all.

675
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,896
- Who are you, really?
- What?

676
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,189
I don't even know your name.

I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern.

679
00:49:56,492 --> 00:49:58,485
My mother called me Flix.

680
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,320
No. Flix.

681
00:50:01,747 --> 00:50:03,372
That's sweet.

682
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:08,124
And how do you live?
What kind of person are you?

683
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:12,371
I'm a prodigal son,
the black sheep of a white flock.

684
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:15,842
I shall die on the gallows.

- Really?
- Really.

686
00:50:18,763 --> 00:50:21,680
I haven't a bit of character. None at all.

687
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:23,473
- No?
- No. Really.

688
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:28,179
You know, when I was a little boy
I was taught to ride and be a gentleman.

689
00:50:28,522 --> 00:50:32,140
Then at school, to pray and lie.

690
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:35,978
And then in the war, to kill and hide.

691
00:50:36,487 --> 00:50:37,862
That's all.

692
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:42,191
And what do you do now?

693
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:45,110
Now I’m a gambler...

running at large, like a happy pig...

695

that pleases me.

696
00:50:52,544 --> 00:50:54,501
I really belong in jail.

What else?

BARON: I'm also a criminal
and a hotel thief.

701
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:32,118
That's not a funny joke.

702
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:37,372
You must believe one thing.

703

You must believe that I love you.

No.

708
00:52:10,198 --> 00:52:12,605
Did you come here just for these?

709
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:16,112
That's horrible.

710
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,664
You may keep the pearls.
I don't want them.

I will not denounce you.

I wanted money desperately.

Can't you understand that?
That's why I wanted your pearls.

01:06:47,622 --> 01:06:51,489
There's no real thing. It just doesn't exist.

924
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:55,159
I thought that, too.

925
01:06:55,462 --> 01:06:57,621
But now I know that it does.

926
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,625
It's wonderful.

927
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:03,296
Come along.

928
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:06,837
- Dance with old Kringelein?
- Of course. Anything for you.

929
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:07,797
BARON: You're sweet.

930
01:07:11,435 --> 01:07:13,677
Here you are. I must speak with you.

931
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:17,353
- Presently, Mr. Preysing.
- No, now. This is very urgent.

932
01:07:17,524 --> 01:07:20,810
This lady has urgent business with me
at the moment.

933
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:24,144
PREYSING: Insolence. Berlin manners.

934
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,235
Good evening, Mr. Preysing.
You're staying here, too?

935
01:07:31,328 --> 01:07:35,492
- I'm sorry, but I cannot place you.
- Kringelein, at the plant.

936
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:37,160
One of our agents.

No. Assistant bookkeeper,
Room 23, Building C, third floor.

938
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:46,171
- I am away, sick.
- That's very interesting.

939
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:47,914
Good day.

[Band playing swing music]

941
01:07:53,682 --> 01:07:56,090
FLAEMM: Would you like to dance,
Mr. Kringelein?

942
01:07:56,184 --> 01:07:58,509
Miss Flaemm, I’ve never danced in public.

943
01:07:58,603 --> 01:08:01,639
- Come along and try it.
- I'd be afraid.

944
01:08:01,731 --> 01:08:04,436
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You'll love it.

945
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:08,691
Miss Flaemmchen, I must speak to you.
This is about a dictating job.

946
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:12,029
- When do we start? Tomorrow morning?
- No, right now.

947
01:08:14,117 --> 01:08:16,359
We were just going to dance.

948
01:08:16,453 --> 01:08:19,370
Do you know each other?
Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.

949
01:08:19,873 --> 01:08:24,119
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend
and not accept your invitation to dance.

950
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:29,372
I couldn't think of not accepting
the invitation to dance.

951
01:08:30,174 --> 01:08:33,625
I understood you to say
that you reported to our plant ill...

952
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:36,755
and you're here in Berlin
indulging in diversions...

953
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,088
which are very much beyond your means?

954
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:42,225
This is very extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein.

955
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,219
I think we should look over your books.

956
01:08:44,312 --> 01:08:47,396
Come along now, children. No fighting.
Save that for the office.

957
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:49,770
Does the world belong to you,
Mr. Preysing?

958
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:51,566
Haven't I got any right to live?

959
01:08:51,652 --> 01:08:53,395
I will wait 10 minutes for you.

960
01:08:53,487 --> 01:08:56,772
If you're not back, it will be necessary
to engage someone else.

961
01:08:56,865 --> 01:08:58,774
BARON: What happened to your dance?

962
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:01,440
We're going now, thank you, Baron.
Come along.

963
01:09:02,286 --> 01:09:04,860
I shall remember this, Mr. Kringelein.

964
01:09:04,955 --> 01:09:08,289
Let the poor devil alone.
Death's staring him in the face.

965
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,700
I did not ask your advice.

966
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:13,786
I think you'd better go away.

967
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,371
We will see
who will remain here the longer.

968

BELLBOY: Baron von Geigern, please.

969
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:25,300
Mr. Kringelein, you must look at my face,
and not the floor.

970
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:26,505
Yes.

971
01:09:31,813 --> 01:09:36,274
- Why, you're trembling.
- I never danced in public before.

972
01:09:36,651 --> 01:09:39,189
- You dance beautifully.
- Thank you.

973
01:09:39,278 --> 01:09:43,442
- That's right.
- I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.

974
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:45,441
Are you really?

975
01:09:45,617 --> 01:09:48,452
For the first time in my life, I’m happy.

976
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:51,866
Are you all right?

977
01:09:51,957 --> 01:09:55,159
Yes. Excuse me, I just stopped a second.

978
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:57,160
FLAEMM: All right. Here we go.

979
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,757
I'm very tired. Do you mind if we stop?

980
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:05,336
OTTO: Thank you.

981
01:10:13,059 --> 01:10:16,807
- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now.
- Must you?

982
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:19,766
Yes, business.
One has to earn a living, you know.

983
01:10:19,857 --> 01:10:21,684
Not you, Miss Flaemm.

984
01:10:21,775 --> 01:10:24,349
Just another desk slave. Money.

985
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:27,604
PREYSING: I'm glad you're here.
FLAEMM: Here I am.

- Did you enjoy your dance?
- Yes, thank you.

987
01:10:29,866 --> 01:10:32,736
- Excuse me. Go away, please.
- Where's the Louisiana Flip?

988
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:35,828
- Would you like a little cognac?
- Yes. You wanted to see me?

989
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:39,163
PREYSING: Yes.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

990
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:43,117
Mr. Preysing, I am not taking orders
from you here.

991
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:45,204
What is this insolence? Please go away.

to be insulting?

but you're quite an ordinary man...</i>

998

- Go away, please. You are annoying.
- You don't like to see me enjoying myself.

999
01:11:05,065 --> 01:11:08,564
When a man's working himself to death,
that's what he's paid for.

1000
01:11:08,651 --> 01:11:11,605
You don't care if a man
can live on his wages or not.

1001
01:11:11,696 --> 01:11:15,907
You have a very regular scale of wages,
and there's the sick fund for you.

1002
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:18,826
OTTO: What a scale, and what a fund.

1003
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:20,868
When I was sick for four weeks...

1004
01:11:20,954 --> 01:11:23,362
you wrote me a letter
telling me I’d be discharged...

1005
01:11:23,457 --> 01:11:25,330
if I were sick any longer.

1006
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,290
Did you write me that letter or not?

1007
01:11:27,377 --> 01:11:30,377
I have no idea of the letters that I write.

1008
01:11:30,463 --> 01:11:33,582
I know that you are here
in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.

- An embezzler!
- Yes, an embezzler.

1011

You are going to take that back!

1012
01:11:40,931 --> 01:11:43,386
Right here in the presence
of this young lady!

Who do you think you're talking to?
You think I’m dirt?

You can't discharge me. I'm sick.

1028

I'm going to die. You understand?

1029
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:41,102
I'm going to die, and nobody
can do anything to me anymore.

1030

Nothing can happen to me anymore.

1031
01:12:44,322 --> 01:12:49,233
Before I can be discharged, I’ll be dead!

1032
01:12:51,829 --> 01:12:56,455
The man's crazy.
I don't know him. He's annoying.

- I'm sorry, Baron.
- Poor old Kringelein. You're all right.

- No.

You wanted to see me?

1050
01:13:56,638 --> 01:13:59,093
Yes. Pardon me. I must go to England.

1051
01:13:59,182 --> 01:14:02,633
It's very important. I must go at once.
I have some very big deals...

involving hundreds of thousands
of marks...

1053
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:10,226
and I thought
I would take along a secretary...

1054
01:14:10,317 --> 01:14:12,808
to take care of my correspondence.

1055
01:14:12,903 --> 01:14:14,610
You know what I mean.

1056
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:17,815
I understood you to say
that you travelled and...

for such a trip?

PREYSING: Yes.

1061

I don't know. I'd have to figure it up.

1062
01:14:35,006 --> 01:14:37,414
I'd need clothes and shoes...

And I’d need a suit.

01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:14,955
- Would you please pay some attention?
- I'm paying attention.

1073
01:15:15,668 --> 01:15:18,206
BARON: How do you do?
PREYSING: Insolence.

1074
01:15:18,296 --> 01:15:19,624
You mean the Baron?

1075
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:23,296
PREYSING: Baron what?
BARON: What?

1076
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:30,799
He's a gentleman.

1077
01:15:46,822 --> 01:15:48,980
Is the Baron tired?

1078
01:15:51,284 --> 01:15:52,992
No, not tired exactly.

1079
01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:56,078
I thought this evening
we could go to the casino.

1080
01:15:56,163 --> 01:15:59,449
That place we passed
with the wonderful bright lights.

1081
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:04,077
Kringelein, I’d adore it.
I can't go anywhere.

1082
01:16:04,212 --> 01:16:06,335
- What?
- I'm broke.

1083
01:16:06,798 --> 01:16:10,249
- No, you're joking.
- Yes. Isn't it odd?

1084
01:16:11,427 --> 01:16:13,467
A baron, broke.

1085
01:16:15,598 --> 01:16:17,389
Excuse me, old man.

1086
01:16:26,232 --> 01:16:27,727
- I quit.
- You can't.

1087
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:29,893
I'm not getting those pearls,
neither are you.

1088
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:31,859
- What about the money?
- I'll pay you back.

1089
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:34,863
- How?
- I have an idea working in my head.

1090
01:16:34,949 --> 01:16:37,190
You might find a bullet through that head.

1091
01:16:37,284 --> 01:16:40,902
If you do that you'll get nothing,
except maybe the police after you.

1092
01:16:41,121 --> 01:16:42,449
MAN: Mme. Grusinskaya's car!

1093
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:46,702
If you wait, I’ll pay you back your 5,000...

1094
01:16:47,627 --> 01:16:49,370
I’ll see you later.

1095
01:16:53,215 --> 01:16:54,793
Go on, Suzette.

1096
01:16:56,218 --> 01:17:00,168
Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight. How I shall dance!

1097
01:17:00,263 --> 01:17:02,303
I want to feel that you're there.

1098
01:17:06,644 --> 01:17:08,720
<i>I came too far.</i>

1099
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:15,108
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't be.

1100
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:16,818
- You'll be on the train?
- Yes.

1101
01:17:16,904 --> 01:17:18,979
- Until then.
- Bless you.

1102
01:17:32,876 --> 01:17:35,747
- Was the Baron joking?
- What?

1103
01:17:35,838 --> 01:17:39,621
- Is it really true?
- What are you talking about, Kringelein?

1104
01:17:39,716 --> 01:17:42,919
Is the Baron really in financial straits?

1105
01:17:46,973 --> 01:17:50,970
To tell you the truth, I must get
some money somehow right away.

1106
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,428
- If the Baron will permit me.
- What?

1107
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:58,899
I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.

1108
01:17:58,984 --> 01:18:00,146
Three hundred?

1109
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:11,150
If I could get into a game of some kind,
I think I might win.

1110
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,241
Gambling! I'd love that!

1111
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:17,949
I've got over 6,800 marks right here.

1112
01:18:18,043 --> 01:18:20,082
If we could scare up some men to play.

1113
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:23,538
- We could go up to my room.
- That's a grand idea.

1114
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,044
Come on.

1115
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:38,928
- Cab, miss?
- What?

1116
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:42,140
- Cab?
- No, thanks. I'll walk.

1117
01:18:45,818 --> 01:18:47,941
BARON: 4,000 marks.
DEALER: 4,000!

1118
01:18:48,028 --> 01:18:48,977
BARON: Too high?

1119
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:53,109
DEALER: 4,000 marks.

1120
01:18:58,329 --> 01:19:00,121
DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.

1121
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:04,579
Thanks.

1122
01:19:07,504 --> 01:19:10,173
PLAYER #1: 8,000 marks.
OTTO: 8,000!

1123
01:19:11,633 --> 01:19:14,124
BARON: I take it all.
PLAYER #2: That's a lot of money.

1124
01:19:14,386 --> 01:19:16,212
I need it, thanks.

1125
01:19:22,059 --> 01:19:23,886
DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.

1126
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:32,979
Baccarat.

1127
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:34,350
PLAYER #2: Too bad there.

1128
01:19:34,446 --> 01:19:36,521
[Men chattering]

1129
01:19:36,614 --> 01:19:39,485
- Now, Mr. Kringelein.
- Baron!

1130
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,740
Will you help me again, please?

1131
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:44,116
I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.

1132
01:19:44,204 --> 01:19:47,538
- Make your bets, gentlemen.
- How much shall I bet?

1133
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:51,042
BARON: How much is left in the bank?
BANKER: 2,500 uncovered.

1134
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:54,039
- Do you feel like going that far?
- All that money, Baron?

1135
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:57,830
Come on, you're killing them tonight.
Go ahead, old man.

1136
01:19:57,925 --> 01:19:59,040
Do you want a card?

1137
01:19:59,302 --> 01:20:00,677
What have you got?

1138
01:20:01,595 --> 01:20:03,920
The old highwayman. He has nine again.

1139
01:20:05,307 --> 01:20:07,596
I win again!

1140
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:11,304
Come on, gentlemen. Please drink! Drink.

1141
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:13,763
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!

1142
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:17,806
Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?

1143
01:20:17,902 --> 01:20:21,602
Yes! Surely. I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.

1144
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:25,777
Come on, now. Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne.

1145
01:20:25,867 --> 01:20:27,776
It's expensive and good.

1146
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:31,160
What will I take the bank for?

1147
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:34,201
- I'll play for 500.
- Baron, all at once?

1148
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,620
Suppose you lose it?

1149
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:38,710
It's all the same thing, Kringelein.
Come on, now, old man.

1150
01:20:39,088 --> 01:20:40,286
Deal me two cards.

1151
01:20:40,381 --> 01:20:43,381
One to me first. One to yourself.

1152
01:20:43,508 --> 01:20:46,675
One to me. One to yourself.

1153
01:20:49,722 --> 01:20:52,213
Baron, if all that money...

1154
01:20:52,725 --> 01:20:54,718
What have you got?

1155
01:20:55,061 --> 01:20:57,682
I've got a nine!

1156
01:20:57,771 --> 01:20:59,396
Isn't that a wonderful thing?

1157
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:03,479
Kringelein, you old robber,
you're hopeless.

1158
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,396
Baron! Baron, please.

1159
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,700
It's no use, old man. It's sweet of you...

1160
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:13,404
- but you have all the luck.
- It's true.

1161
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:17,574
I have luck, for the first time in my life!
I have luck!

1162
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:23,249
Baron, are you out?
Have you finished playing?

1163
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:24,795
Yes, thank you.

1164
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,091
I'll recover again presently,
in 10 or 20 years.

1165
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:32,425
OTTO: Look, Doctor. I've won again!

1166
01:21:32,511 --> 01:21:33,922
PLAYER #3: There you are.

1167
01:21:34,013 --> 01:21:37,927
OTTO: Baron, I win and drink,
and drink and win!

1168
01:21:40,018 --> 01:21:42,805
Gentlemen, please don't go.

1169
01:21:42,896 --> 01:21:46,146
Be my guests. Don't go. I beg your pardon.

1170
01:21:46,232 --> 01:21:50,810
I know I oughtn't to presume,
but I’m so grateful to you.

1171
01:21:50,903 --> 01:21:52,611
It's been so marvelous.

1172
01:21:52,697 --> 01:21:57,488
For the first time in my life,
I’ve gambled and I’ve danced.

1173
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,403
You gentlemen can laugh...

1174
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:03,444
but for the first time in my life,
I’ve tasted life!

1175
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:07,619
- Splendid!
- Life is wonderful, but it's very dangerous.

1176
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:10,830
<i>If you have the courage to live it,
it's marvelous.</i>

1177
01:22:11,547 --> 01:22:13,954
PLAYER #4: Wonderful!
OTTO: You don't know about that.

1178
01:22:14,049 --> 01:22:17,833
<i>You're healthy and happy.
But l, believe me...</i>

1179
01:22:17,928 --> 01:22:22,139
if a man doesn't know death,
he doesn't know life.

1180
01:22:22,223 --> 01:22:26,684
PLAYER #5: It's a short life, but a gay one.
OTTO: Please, gentlemen, don't go.

1181
01:22:26,769 --> 01:22:29,521
Come on. Drink to life...

1182
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:33,314
to the magnificent, dangerous...

1183
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,354
brief, wonderful life.

1184
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:39,196
BARON: Kringelein!
OTTO: And the courage to live it.

1185
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:42,317
You know, I’ve only lived since last night...

1186
01:22:42,826 --> 01:22:47,653
but that little while seems longer
than all the time that's gone before.

1187
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:49,575
All of...

1188
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:52,950
Take him over to his bed.

1189
01:22:53,043 --> 01:22:54,668
<i>Turn him around.</i>

1190
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,666
BARON: How is he, Doctor?

1191
01:22:59,799 --> 01:23:03,334
DOCTOR: It will be over in a minute.
OTTO: Over?

1192
01:23:05,346 --> 01:23:09,924
OTTO: It's only just begun.
DOCTOR: Quiet, Kringelein. Don't be afraid.

1193
01:23:10,017 --> 01:23:12,305
I'm not afraid, Doc.

1194
01:23:12,686 --> 01:23:15,556
- I'm not afraid to die.
- There, there.

1195
01:23:15,647 --> 01:23:19,016
You'll be all right.
Too much iced champagne.

1196
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:23,192
- What?
- Hello, Baron.

1197
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:24,773
Hello, Kringelein.

1198
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,192
You old drunkard.

1199
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:37,540
It's late.

1200
01:23:54,891 --> 01:23:58,224
DOCTOR: What is it?
OTTO: My pocketbook.

1201
01:23:59,145 --> 01:24:03,890
I've lost my pocketbook.
14,000 marks in that pocketbook.

1202
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:07,693
OTTO: I've got to find it.
DOCTOR: No, stay where you are.

1203
01:24:07,778 --> 01:24:09,438
OTTO: No, I’ve got to find that.

1204
01:24:09,529 --> 01:24:11,985
DOCTOR: Kringelein!
OTTO: 14,000 marks.

1205
01:24:13,533 --> 01:24:17,661
<i>14,000 marks were in that pocketbook.</i>

1206
01:24:18,955 --> 01:24:21,327
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

1207
01:24:21,415 --> 01:24:25,543
<i>You don't know what that money means
to a man like me.</i>

1208
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:29,376
You've never lived like a dog in a hole...

1209
01:24:29,756 --> 01:24:31,583
and scrimped and saved.

1210
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:36,128
You did not see his pocketbook,
did you, Baron?

1211
01:24:36,387 --> 01:24:37,418
No.

1212
01:24:38,431 --> 01:24:41,301
My life hangs on that money, Baron.

1213
01:24:41,851 --> 01:24:44,638
Nobody ever gives you anything
for nothing.

1214
01:24:44,728 --> 01:24:48,263
You have to buy everything,
and pay cash for it.

1215
01:24:48,774 --> 01:24:52,308
<i>I wanted to pay for my last days
with that money.</i>

1216
01:24:55,738 --> 01:24:57,731
<i>I must find it!</i>

1217
01:24:57,823 --> 01:25:01,275
I haven't anything in the world
but that pocketbook!

1218
01:25:01,368 --> 01:25:06,279
<i>Every hour costs money. I must find it!</i>

1219
01:25:09,751 --> 01:25:14,045
Here's your pocketbook,
you silly old thing.

1220
01:25:15,048 --> 01:25:18,048
BARON: There's your money.
OTTO: You found it!

1221
01:25:18,134 --> 01:25:21,087

Oh, hello.You're, uh, you're probably hereAbout the, uh, the story.Elves love to tell stories.I-I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.There's, uh, probably a lot of thingsYou... you didn't know about elves.Another... another interesting
uh, elf ismUh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.The first is making shoes at nightWhile, you know, while the old...The old cobbler sleeps.Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.You can bake cookiesIn a tree.As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
having an ovenIn an oak tree during the dry season.I wanna make shoes!But the third job... uh, some call
it, uh,"The show," or... or "the big dance,"It's the profession that every elf
aspires to,And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.Only two weeks left till Christmas!I-It's a job only an elf can do.Our... our nimble fingers,Natural cheer and active mindsAre perfect for toy-building.They... they tried using gnomes
and trolls,But the gnomes drank too much......and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,And, as you may have guessed,That's where our story begins.Are you sleepy?Here we are.We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.Here we are.There you are.It's time to go to sleep.Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.Merry Christmas, my ángel.All right, all right.We've had another very successful
year.So, after all that hard work,It's time to start preparationsFor next Christmas!What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?A baby..."little buddy diapers."His name is buddy. He must've...Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.What do we do?So, Santa had a
Decision to make,And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,Santa's a... a pushover.So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elfWho had always wanted a child?But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.Santa.Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.I was his adopted father.Though buddy grew twice as fast,He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.Chuckles not too fast, buddy.I mean, not... not really.Before we learn how to build
The latestIn extreme graphic chipset
Processors,Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"Shall we?Number one."Treat every day like Christmas."Number two."There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."Number three."The best way to spread Christmas
CheerIs singing loud for all to hear."And one day, when buddy was
old enough,I made him my own personal
apprentice.I've never been in this room
before.Well, I think it's time you startYour tinker training.Santa's sleigh.You're gonna help me make it fly.I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.Well, silly as it sounds,A lot of people down southDon't believe in Santa Claus.What?!Well, who do they think puts all?
Their toys under the tree?Well, there's a rumor floating aroundThat, uh, that the parents do it.That's... that's ridiculous.I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.What about Santa's cookies?I suppose parents eat them, too?Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,Uh, and every earless and less
PeopleBelieve in Santa Claus.I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.That's shocking.That's why I came upWith this little beauty in the '60s.WH-what is it?It's a cringle 3000...A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.Without it, the sleigh couldn'tGet more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.Well, it looks like we gotA short in the thermo coupler.You wanna give mea hand with that?You want me to help?As much as, uh, buddy was acceptedBy his family and friends,There were a few drawbacksTo being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.Hey, Ming Ming.Um...I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.It's all right, buddy.Just how many etch-a-sketchesDid you get finished?Come on, buddy. How many?I made, uh... 85.Eighty-five?That puts you...915 off the pace.Ooh... that's bad.Why don't you just say it?I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.We all just have different talents
That's all.Seems like everyone elseHave the same talents
except for me.You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...Special talents?You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.You sure did... aaa's.And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...Won't he?And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.You bring us down whole octave.In a good way.See, buddy?You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.You're just... special.And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.Hey, foom foom...I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you couldHelp me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?No problem. I appreciate it.Buddy is killing me.I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.That was quick thinking yesterdayWith that ¡°special talents¡± thing.I feel bad for the guy.I just hope he doesn't get wise.Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,I don't think he ever will.If he hasn't figured
Out he's a humanBy now, I don't think he ever will.I think they're too small.You're just... special.You don't look so good, buddy.Are you okay?I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.Buddy...Buddy, are you okay?I'm sorry, papa.I just need some alone time.Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.Buddy, uh, I think there's somethingI... I probably should tell you.You probably should have found
out a long...A long time ago.I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his fatherHad fallen in love when he was
very youngWith a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,And how buddy was bornAnd put up for adoption by
his mother,And how she had later passed away.I... I told him his fatherHad never even known that
Buddy was born,And most importantly,I told him where his father was...Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.My dad works there?Empire state building.Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?Not now, arctic puffin.Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.Why the long face, partner?It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.'Course you're not. You're 6'3"And had a beard since you were 15.Papa says my real fatherLives in a magical place far away.I don't know what to do.At least you have a daddy.I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.Buddy, I've been around the world
Many timesWhen I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...Except dogs.Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.Oh, I know that.All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunityTo find out whom you really are.So, I hear you're goingOn a little journey to
the big city.Yup. Ahh.I'm kind a nervous.Leon says New York is pretty
different.Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.I've been to New York thousands
of times.Really?What's it like?Well, there are some things you
should know.First off, you see gum on
The street,Leave it there. It's not
free candy.Oh. Second,There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.They all claim to be the
Original,But the real one' son 11th.And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"That doesn't mean that
They're letting youLook at presents before Christmas.Can't wait to see my dad...We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.Yeah, that's the other thingI wanted to talk to you about.You know, buddy...Your father...Well... he's on the naughty list.No!You're taking the books back?See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,When, in actuality, you're the oneThat missed the payments.But the children love the books.I know that, uh...You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,But I like hearing that.Listen, some people, they just
Lose sightOf what's important in life.That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?Maybe all they needIs just a little Christmas spirit.Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.I know you are.And I'll...I'll always, uh,I'll always be here for you.Now, uh...Go... uh, get.Bye, guys.Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy.

dependency.An elf?What he needs is to be nurtured.Oh, I see.So, um, uh...You'd like me to breastfeed him?Walter, just bring him home.Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,And once... once he comes to

stay here.Clearly he has some serious issues.We can't just throw him out in
the snow.Why not? He loves the snow.He's told me 15 times.Walter, he's your son.Did you hear that?You are so weird.Dad?Dad?Dad!What?What?I am not gonna tuck you in.I... I promise I'll go right

at the farmWith, you know, a rabbit, and...No. No tomatoes...Too vulnerable.Kids, they're already vulnerable.No, you see? I... I told you guys.I told them the very same thing...And no farms.Every body's pushing small town
rural.A farm book would just be white
noise.What about this?Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.I have no time, so, you know,If you've got a story here...I've got about five or six great
starts here.I've got one idea that
I'm especiallyPsyched out of my mind about.You know, it's one of those ideasWhere you're just like, uh...Yes!Whoa!Uh, great, c-could we hear it?I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uhDad! I'm in love, I'm in love,And I don't care who knows it!Buddy, not now, uh,Can you please go back to the...

working here.Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.He doesn't, uh... get back toThe story, please. All right, okay.So, on the cover above the title...Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?Buddy... go back to the basement.Hey, jack weed,I get more action in a weekThan you've had your entire life.I've got houses in I.e., Paris,

peach that lives on a farm.What's more vulnerable than a
peach?What, uh, what do we do?I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.Uh, how much time we got?We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,

over there a ways.The engine? The engine, yeah.Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!I'm standing here outside
central parkWhere it is unclear exactly
what has happened.What we do know is that
authoritiesHave closed the parkAnd are in the process of
clearing it.The only thing that people can
seem to agree on hereIs that they saw something fall
from the sky.I've got an eyewitness with meWho claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.What did you actually see?You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.Oh, your daughter saw it?Sweetheart, can you tell meWhat you saw falling out of the
sky?It was Santa's sleigh!Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.Santa's in Manhattan.Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,But New York one has just receivedSome exclusive amateur news footageThat you just might Anna follow
up on.There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elfWandering through central park.Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting newsYou're used to covering in buffalo,

central park.It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.Dick, uh, according to authorities,The area has been cleared.Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.These forces are highly trained,But rarely see action.Some have accused them of being
too gung hoWhen called into duty,And their controversial crowd
control tacticsAt the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85Are still under investigation.I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!Slap it on real quick, we've got

Laboratories in San Francisco.</i><i>The lab technician now
known as Patient Zero...</i><i>was accidentally exposed
to retrovirus ALZ-113....</i><i>an Alzheimer's trial drug that
was being tested on chimpanzees.</i><i>The infected chimps showed signs of
erratic and aggressive behavior...</i><i>that led to their escape
from the facility.</i><i>The now-famous incident on

the apes disappearing into Muir woods.</i><i>Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed

150 million in the next 6 to 8 months.</i><i>Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness

we've come, Maurice.Seems long ago.Still think about them?Humans?Sometimes.Didn't know them like you did.Only saw their bad side.Good, bad... doesn't matter now.Humans destroyed each other.Apes fight too.But we are family.Wonder if they're really all gone.Ten winters now...Last two... no sign of them.They must be gone.That bear wouldn't get
me Blue Eyes. I'm quick!Shut up, Ash!Oh, God. It's okay.It's okay. It's okay. Freeze!Stay! Help!Help! No!Hey!Over here!I shot him! I shot him.They shot Ash! Shot my son!Rocket, wait...We don't mean any harm!They're apes, man. You think they
understand what you're saying?Do they look like just apes to you?- Dad.
- Malcolm, what are you doing?- Dad?
- Malcolm.It's okay.Put your guns down.- You can't be serious.
- Do it.Go!- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.Okay. Okay, we're going.Go!Slowly. Go, go, go!- My bag!
- Go!Koba!Follow!Did you find it?We need to talk.What? What's wrong?The dam is pretty much intact.It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.But there is a problem. Get in.I shot him. I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.- Jesus Christ. How many were there?
- There were a lot. There were like, 80.- At least.
- Okay...you're not hearing what
he's saying. They spoke!That is not possible.I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.Incredible? They're talking apes!- With big-ass spears!
- Please!I don't know exactly what
you think you saw or heard...but you have to calm down, okay?What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?We're all genetically immune or we
would've been dead a long time ago.- You don't know that for sure.
- She worked with the CDC. She knows.- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.- We need that power.
- He could've killed us, but he didn't.Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!- What do you mean, "he"?
- That's what we're trying to tell you.It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...- He was remarkable.
- Really? Is that what you thought?- It's what we saw.
- Yeah, it's what we all saw.Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?Not a word until we can
figure out what to do.- You gotta be kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.I don't want to create a panic.How are you doing, pal? Are you okay?- I dropped my bag.
- I know.- Was your sketchbook in there?
- It's gone.Carver just told me we're not gonna
tell anybody what happened up there.Not yet. No.Must attack them now!Before they attack us!We don't know how many there are.
How many guns they have?Or why they came up here?They shot your son, Rocket!Don't you want to fight?I follow Caesar.Koba's right!They almost killed you, Ash!No!If we go to war...We could lose all we've built...Home.Family.Future.I will decide by morning.Caesar.For years I was a
prisoner in their lab...They cut me... Tortured me.You freed me.I would do anything you ask.But we must show strength!We will, Koba.Coming through. Coming through.That's a hell of a lot
more than eighty!Malcolm!Apes...do not want war...but will fight...if we must.Ape home.Human home.Do not come back.Everyone!Everyone, you have to calm down!Everybody.Everybody!Please! We're all immune!We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!How did they find us?We found them.- You knew they were out there!
- What if they come back?Yeah!If they come back...
If they come back...they'll be sorry they ever did!Now, this city may not have the manpower
it once did but it has the firepower.Those stockpiles left behind by FEMA,the National Guard, we have it all.Look...I know why you're scared.I'm scared, too, believe me.But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.We've been through hell together.But you all know what
we're up against.We're almost out of fuel.Which means no more power...which means we could slip
back to the way things were.That dam up there was the answer.We just had no idea they
were up there, too.- So, what do we do now?
- Yeah!We find another way...because that power... is not
just about keeping the lights on.It's about giving us the tools to
reconnect to the rest of the world.To find out who else is out there...so that we can start to...
to rebuild...and reclaim...the world we lost.That was a great speech.There is no alternative power source.That dam is the only option.Well, then, we fight them.We're two weeks away from running
out of fuel. Maybe three, tops.- I know.
- And once that happens...I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...and calm everybody down.We need that power to get
the radio transmitter working.It's our only chance of
reaching the outside world.We have to find other survivors.Yeah. There's not
that many of us left.- We can't afford any more casualties.
- We founded this place...- you and I...
- I know....on the idea that power would lead
us back to the life we once had.If we can't stick together,- maybe we can't survive.
- I lost everything.The idea of losing
what little I have is...I want to go back up there.Listen to me. Give me three days.
Let me talk to him. If it doesn't work,- then we do it your way.
- And what if it backfires?What if he gets violent? I mean, how do
you know that he'll even understand you?He's more than just an ape.I'm gonna take some
men up to Fort Point.I'm gonna go through the armory.
I'm gonna see what's still working.Three days. You're not back in
three days we're going up there,and we're gonna kill
every last one of them.Carver is getting the trucks ready.He'll be here with Foster
and Kemp any minute.You're really taking Carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.I don't really have any choice.
He used to work at the water department.He's the only one who
knows how the dam works.Malcolm... what are you gonna do
up there? What are you gonna say?I'll tell him the truth.Hope I catch him in a good mood.You think I'm crazy.I'm worried.Yeah, so am I.I've gone over it in my head...and I think if I don't
at least try this...there's gonna be a war.Take me with you. What if someone
gets hurt? You'll need me there.I love you.But I need you to stay here.I don't want Alexander to be alone.I'm coming, too.Son, it's not safe.But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.I'm coming. Please.No one gets out of the trucks.No one.If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.It's gonna be okay.Please. Please. Please. Please.Please don't kill me.Just hear what I have to say.I know."Don't come back." I know. I just...I wouldn't be here unless it were...Okay! Okay! Okay!Okay, okay, okay.I need to show you something.
It's not far.- Human lies!
- No! No!No, no, no. No, I swear.If I could just show you,
then you'll understand. Please.Show me.This is what we used
to call a "small hydro."It was built to service areas
to the north of here...but we've been working to reroute
the power lines to the city...because the city used to run off nuclear
power, but that ran out years ago.So, we've been using diesel
generators and gasifiers.But if we can just get
this dam working...then we have a shot at
restoring limited power.Is any of this making
any sense to you?The... lights.Yes.The lights.This is your home and I don't want
to take it away from you, I promise.But if you can allow us...
let us do our work here...You brought others?Just a few.I'm not a threat. If I am...then I guess you can kill me.Come on!- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Stop, stop.We need to give them our guns.That's the one condition.- What does that mean?
- We can stay.If they get power,
they'll be more dangerous!Why help them?!They seem desperate...If we make them go, they'll attack.Let them.We'll destroy them
while they're weak.And how many apes will die?We have one chance for peace...Let them do their human work.
Then they'll go.Human work?Human work.Human work.Human work!Koba say...Apes should hate humans...Enough!From humans Koba learned hate...But nothing else.Hey. You need to eat.Okay.That was brave, what you did today.Malcolm. I know everyone's
depending on you...I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.I care about him.He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.I know.I have been trying
to get closer to him.But...You will.You know the scary thing about them?They don't need power, lights.Heat. Nothing.- Hey, pal.
- That's their advantage.That's what makes them stronger.Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.With what? They took our guns.If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.Maybe they're just taking their time.
They killed off half the planet already.Come on.- What?
- You can't honestly blame the apes.Who the hell else am I going
to blame? It was the Simian Flu.It was a virus created by scientists in
a lab. The chimps they were testing on- didn't have a say in the matter.
- Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.You're telling me you don't get sick
to your stomach at the sight of them?- Didn't you have a little girl?
- Carver, that's enough.- How did she die?
- That's enough!Or your wife, for that matter.Carver, you better shut up
before I kick your ass.Okay.I'm the asshole.Are you okay?You sound sick... You ok?Just need rest.You worry about the humans...Where's Koba?Still angry.Said he was going hunting...Look, humans below!Why are we here?Caesar trusts humans...Koba does not.- Most of the arsenal seems functional.
- Good.We're testing them out back.Hey!Don't you move! Don't move,
do you understand me?Terry! Terry, get in here, quick!Holy shit.What do we do? What do we do?Where did he come from?- Should we shoot him?
- Maybe. I don't know.You are one ugly son
of a bitch, aren't you?Whoa, man.Dude, I think he's hungry.He must have gotten
separated from the others.You lost? Trying to get home?Go on! Get out of here,
stupid monkey!- Go on. You heard him. Go!
- Go! Go!Enough guns here to kill every ape...Must warn Caesar.Who knows what humans
are really doing up there?We gotta clear this blockage.I didn't know you had a daughter.Yeah.What was her name?Sarah.I'm really sorry.Well, now I have you
and your dad, so...Yeah.All right, you got that straight?That's all the wire we got.Brace yourselves.Three... two... one.- Dad!
- Malcolm!Malcolm! Malcolm!Dad?I can't see Carver.Don't!- Leave it there.
- I got it.It's not broken.Let go. Let go. Good.Thank you.You saved our lives.We've got a lot of debris to clear now.
We might need a bit more time.How long?Hey, buddy.Hey... hey...What are you doing? Are you finished?What are you looking at?Hey! Hey!Hey, get out of there!- Hey! I'll kill you!
- Carver, what're you doing?Don't! Don't! Caesar, no!No.Said no guns!- No, don't.
- Please.I didn't know.Human leave now!Man, we screwed now.Malcolm?Malcolm, where are
you going? Malcolm.Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.This my home.- You should not be here.
- I understand.Malcolm.She's sick.How long has she been this way?I have medicine.Antibiotics.Maybe she can help.Do not trust you.I don't blame you.But believe me...
we are not all like him.Please.Let us help you.One day.You stay one day.- We might need a little more time.
- One day!Ape will help.I will not help!- This is bullshit, man!
- Get him out of here.Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.Come on, man.Okay?Move, come on!Get in!See you tomorrow, asshole.Just came from the city.
Humans very dangerous!Where is Caesar?With the humans...Yo, Alex. This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.Yeah.Caesar.Hey!No! No, no, no, don't! No! No! No!Where Caesar? Want Caesar.Caesar!Humans attack your sons.You let them stay!Put apes in danger!Caesar love humans more...than apes!More than your...sons.Ape...not...kill... ape.Forgive me.You are my son...I need you to listen...You didn't tell Caesar
about the guns we found?Neither will you.Your father doesn't trust me now.You need to protect him.His love for humans...Makes him blind.I know...As long as they are here...I fear for Caesar's life.For yesterday.Look. Look.Watch. Watch."It was Friday."A real nice afternoon."Warm."We were hanging... hanging..."We were hanging out..."at this kegger down
at the swimming hole."Hanging out.Hanging.Here. You can read?Now, this is the good stuff.- Cheers.
- Cheers.What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!No! No! Go!- He understood that, didn't he?
- Yeah.Hey, hey, hey!Hey, hey.Hey.- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.- I think he likes you.
- Shut up.All right, all right.You want a drink, fugly?Go on, give him some.Give him some, man. See what happens.There you go. Whoa, hey!Whoa, whoa, whoa!Shit!- That's good, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.- Hey, hey, hey!
- Okay. All right.- Easy.
- Yeah.- Easy.
- Easy.All right...Malcolm! Malcolm!What? What is it? What happened?It worked.At least here it did. We'll know
when we get back to the city.Trust.Son of a bitch.You son of a bitch!The... lights.Feeling better?Mother...?Human gun!Run.Humans kill Caesar!Burn ape home!Go! Get them!Apes must attack human city!Fight back!Come, fight for Caesar!Females and young stay in woods...We go to the city!We will avenge your father's death!Ellie!

- Where is he taking us?Malcolm, stop!I don't understand.
What are we doing here?It doesn't matter. We just
need a place to hide him...until we find out what's
going on at home.Go move the table.Okay. Right here.Okay.Dad, look.Look.We need to operate.
I don't have anything.There's a surgical kit

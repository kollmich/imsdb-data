Uh, you boys,
move on back now, OK?

54
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,373
Came all this way
to build us a factory,

55
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,243
make somethin' outta this town.

56

Yeah.

58
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:26,098
Sam, did he have a wallet,
identification, anything like that?

59
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,851
That's the first thing I looked for.
Whoever fixed him musta took 'em.

60
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,887
Nothin', huh?

61
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,933
- Any witnesses?
- I mean, not even a cat.

62
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,905
- How long's he been dead?
- Oh, less than an hour.

63
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,442
- Less than an hour.
- Maybe half that.

64
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,702
Maybe half.

65
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,412
Could have been a hitchhiker.

66
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,876
Check both ends of town, check the
depot, and check the pool hall. OK?

67
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,463
- Pool hall closes at one o'clock, Chief.
- I said check it, Sam.

68
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,046
Yes, sir.

69
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,127

70
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,511

71
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,268
Get against that wall.
Get them hands high!

72
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,358
You spread them fingers.
I wanna count all ten.

00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:54,488
You move before I tell you to, boy,
by God, I'm gonna clean your plow.

74
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,315
That's pretty fat there,
ain't it, boy? Huh?

75
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,490
Now, outside there's a police car.
You're gonna pick up that bag.

76
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,777
You're gonna walk out, and you're
gonna plant yourself in the back.

77
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,868
And you're gonna be a real
nice quiet boy all the way in.

78
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,328
You hear?!

79
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,605
C'mon, boy.

80
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,858
Move it!

81
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,788
Chief here?

82
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,745
- Hey, what's up, Sam?
-  Chief?

83
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,002
What's goin' on?

84
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,793
Sam?

85
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
- Wood?
- Yes, sir?

86
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,376
When's the last time I asked Courtney
to get oil for this damn thing?

87
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,038
Uh, last Wednesday.

88
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,674
Would you be kind enough to go outside
and remind him what day it is <i>today?</i>

89
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,758
Well, uh...
how about the prisoner here?

90
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,257
Don't you worry about him.

91
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,425
Got a name, boy?

92
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:22,969
Virgil Tibbs.

93
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,973
Virgil?

94
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,947
Well, I don't think we're gonna
have any trouble, are we, Virgil?

95
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,488
No trouble at all.

96
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,327
Oh, you can go now, Sam.

97
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,587
Yes, sir.

98
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,762
- What did you hit him with?
- Hit whom?

99
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,424
"Whom"?
Whom?

100
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,140
You a Northern boy? What's a Northern
boy like you doin' all the way down here?

101
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,910
I was waiting for the train.

102
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:09,382
There ain't no trains
this time of mornin'.

103
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,861
- Tuesdays only. 4:05 to Memphis.
- You say.

104
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,411
Well...
All right, you say right.

105
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,668
All right...
Virgil.

106
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,009
Oh!

107
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,265
Now look.

108
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,979
I try to run a nice, clean,
safe town here.

109
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:53,644
A town where a man can sneeze and not
get his brains beat out. You follow me?

110
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,233
Yes.

111
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:01,618
Why don't you tell me how you killed Mr.
Colbert? You'll feel a whole lot better.

112
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,283
Not now!

113
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,927
I was visiting my mother.

114
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,264
I came in on the 12:35 from Brownsville.

115
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,773
I was waiting to go
out on the 4:05.

116
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,145
Mm-hm.

117
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,703
Yeah.

118
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:54,747
And meanwhile, you killed yourself a
white man and picked yourself up $200!

119
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,711
I earned that money, ten hours
a day, seven days a week.

120
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,549
Colored can't earn that. It's more than I
make in a month! Where did you earn it?!

121
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,677
- Philadelphia.
- Mississippi?

122
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,140
- Pennsylvania.
- Just how do you earn that kinda money?

123
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,805
I'm a police officer.

124
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,561
Oh, yeah.

125
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,992
- Wood!
- Yes, sir!

126
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,239
- Did you question this man?
- No, sir.

127
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,836
Would you mind taking
a look at that?

128
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,510
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

129
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,926
I'll check on this wise city boy.
You take him outside and hold him.

130
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,890
Yes, sir.

131
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,273
May I suggest that you call my chief
rather than send a wire or anything?

132
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,811
I mean, it would be quicker.
And I'll pay for the call.

133
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,448
Did you hear? Did you hear him
say he'd pay for the call?

134
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,608
How much do they pay you
to do their police work?

135
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,655
$162.39 per week.

136
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:57,168
$162.39 a week!

137
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,456
Well, boy! Take him outside, Wood.
But treat him easy,

138
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,843
because a man that
makes $162.39 a week...

139
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,425
man, we do not wanna ruffle him!

140
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,683
No, sir!

141
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,896
Courtney... would you try
and get me long-distance?

142
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,075
Police business, honey.
Chief's on the line.

143
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,960
No. He catch you listenin' in, he'll
run your butt around the block.

144
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,716
- He don't panic me none.
- No?

145
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,217
- Where's the chief?
- You got the pictures of the dead man?

146
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,724
Sure do. I got him top,
bottom, sideways... you name it.

147
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,978
- Good. I'll take 'em, son.
- No, I wanna give 'em to the chief.

148
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,855
- I said I'd take 'em, Charlie.
- Do like he tells you, Charlie.

149
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,900
Somebody owes me
some money for those.

150
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,063
I had to buy paper and film
and developin'.

151
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,825
That's all right. Just bill the department.
Everything will be taken care of.

152
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,908
God Almighty.
He sure looks bad.

153
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,827
May I see the man
I am supposed to have killed?

154
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,713
Sure.
I don't know why not.

155
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,001
<i>Hey, Sam.
He's finished talkin'.</i>

156
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,053
- Here's the photos of the dead man.
- OK.

157
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,684
Got your chief on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

158
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,523
Hello? Yes, sir. I'm sorry to
have gotten you involved in this.

159
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,192
I really had no choice.

160
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,579
Yes, sir.

161
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:02,460
You can't be serious, sir. I mean, even if
I could be of help, they wouldn't want it.

162
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,497
No, sir. I'm not prejudiced.

163
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,178
Yes, sir. I am a police officer and
they're police officers, but...

164
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,725
Hello. This is Gillespie.
Yes, sir. Yep, well...

165
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,899
You don't say?

166
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,019
He's your number one
homicide expert?

167
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,108
Well, my, my, my.

168
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,491
I don't think we need any help.
We can wrap this up ourselves.

169
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,947
Yes, sir.
But I do want to thank you

170
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,616
for offering me such a powerful piece
of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.

171
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,705
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Yeah. Goodbye, now.

172
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:51,126
Oh, it's all there. We paid
for the phone call ourselves.

173
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,092
Now, you are the number one
homicide expert.

174
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,138
- That's right.
- I bet you look at a lot of dead bodies.

175
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,102
Lots.

176
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,265
Well?

177
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,902
- Well, what?
- Well...

178
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,737
I just thought maybe, uh... Maybe you
wouldn't mind takin' a look at this one?

179
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,361
No, thanks.

180
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,576
- Why not, expert?
- Because I've got a train to catch.

181
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,367
Wait a minute.
That train don't leave till noon.

182
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:29,039
They pay you $162.39 a week just to look
at bodies. Why can't you look at this one?

183
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,506
- Why can't you look at it for yourself?
- Because I'm not an expert...

184
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,839
Officer!

185
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:49,860
Ten cents, ten million dollars... just
doesn't matter when a man's time comes.

186
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,860
Mm-hm.

187
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,943
I could give him a nicer service
right here in Sparta

188
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,281
than he could ever get up there in
Chicago. And at half the price, too.

189
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,572
I got a rosewood casket out there...

190
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,667
Ted Ulam, Chief.
We haven't had the pleasure.

191
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,920
That's for sure.

192
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,090
He's with me.

193
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,511
Hello, Doc.

194
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,298
Yep.

195
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,224
Well...

196
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,560
Uh...

197
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,063
Do you wanna look at it?

198
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,802
New manicure.
That's good.

199
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,567
That's very good.

200
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,870
- I'll need a few things.
-  Such as?

201
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:36,712
Ammonium hydrosulfide,
benzidine, superoxide of hydrogen.

202
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,428
Copper powder, distilled water.

203
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,892
A six-inch celluloid scale.

204
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,645
Thermometer.

205
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,322
Some tweezers.

206
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,486
Calipers.
And some toothpicks.

207
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,622
Toothpicks?! Copper...?
What's goin' on here, Chief?

208
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,748
Who is this boy anyway?

209
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,332
I asked him to look at the body.
That's who he is.

210
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,542
It's 4:45.
What time was this man killed?

211
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:20,335
Sam found him at 3 a.m. The doctor
says it's he was killed an hour earlier.

212
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,634
- At two?
- Maybe a little later.

213
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,391
2115... 2:30?

214
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,143
Would you feel the
face and jaw, please?

215
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,397
Am I mistaken,
or has rigor begun?

216
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,559
It has.

217
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,855
You'll notice too that
postmortem lividity is present.

218
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,992
So the time of death really has
to be earlier. Wouldn't you say?

219
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,618
Mm.

220
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:50,532
Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that
as soon as I get a thermometer.

221
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,748
As you know, the loss of heat from
the brain is the most reliable way

222
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,413
of determining time of death.

223
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,965
Right, Chief?

224
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,336
Oh, yeah.

225
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,966
Well...

226
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,808
Which one of you gentlemen
will assist me?

227
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,742
Ulam's Funer...
It's for you, Chief.

228
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,285
Yeah. Talk to me.

229
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,325
When?

230
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,376
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I've
got a runaway suspect, boy. I gotta go.

231
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,756
Now listen, you. Anything he wants,
man, you better see that he gets it.

232
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,008
Where can I wash my hands?

233
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,990
This here's Shagbag, you hear?
He's headed for the river.

234
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,906
The river, you hear?
He's gonna be in Arkansas.

235
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,158
Shoot.

236
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,893
OK. I got him.

237
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,462
Mrs. Colbert.

238
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,475
How is she taking it?

239
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:35,405
Chief had to leave.
She don't know it yet.

240
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,928
Hey! You can't go in there, boy!

241
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,440
- Mrs. Colbert?
- Where's my husband?

242
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,650
What's happened to him? Why won't
anybody tell me what's happened to him?

243
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,536
Why won't anybody here tell me?
I have a right to know if he's hurt,

244
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,039
if he's been in an accident.
I want to know if he is all right!

245
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,576
Your husband is dead,
Mrs. Colbert.

246
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,751
Uh...

247
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,007
Somebody killed him.

248
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,919
We don't know who... yet.

249
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,485
It's, uh...

250
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,698
It's very hot in here.

251
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,367
It's very hot in this room.

252
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,291
Sit down.

253
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,960
No.

254
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,403
Would you...

255
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:35,997
Would you... leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

256
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,102
Virgil, we don't need you or your
microscopes. Tell that to your chief.

257
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,763
We don't need him... or you.

258
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,975
Mrs. Colbert's in there.

259
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,899
- I've already told her.
- I see.

260
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:46,112
Here is the examination results from
Ulam's. You wanna know what I found?

261
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,118
No. I don't need to
look at 'em now.

262
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,575
May I examine this prisoner?

263
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,867
Yeah, you can look at him.
C'mon, let him look. Go on.

264
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,520
All right, now! Steady!

265
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,445
You finished?

266
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,531
Thank you.

267
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,323
All right, Fryer,
bring him with me.

268
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,577
- Now we're grindin' corn!
- You shoulda been there!

269
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,498
If it weren't for them radios, we woulda
lost him goin' over that bridge.

270
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,634
That old boy highballing that
train like to cut us off.

271
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,920
And old Charlie's hound
dog got loose...

272
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,838
- Did he confess?
- Huh?

273
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,475
The man you arrested,
did he confess?

274
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,056
Well, I believe he will.

275
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,722
Yes siree, I believe he will.

276
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,265
I believe he will.

277
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,103
- He's left-handed, isn't he?
- How do <i>I</i> know?

278
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,354
Well, he seemed left-handed to me.

279
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:11,323
I believe Harvey <i>is</i> a southpaw.
Now, ain't he, Shagbag?

280
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,033
What if he is?
What's that make him?

281
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,540
Innocent.

282
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:22,837
Mrs. Colbert...
There's just one more thing.

283
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,927
Yeah.

284
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:38,471
I picked it up, I tell you. He was already
lyin' there. It was lyin' there next to him!

285
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,687
I just picked it up, ma'am.
That's all I did.

286
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,726
Shut up.

287
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,022
- Get him outta here.
- OK. C'mon, Harvey. Let's go.

288
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:05,748
Mrs. Colbert, I, uh... I wonder if you'd
mind if I have somebody drive you over

289
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:10,511
so you could, uh...
complete the identification?

290
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:35,286
Martin, I want you to take Mrs. Colbert
over to the funeral parlor.

291
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,491
And, Wood,
run Virgil down the depot.

292
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:42,376
Uh... Virge here, Chief,
he thinks that Harvey's innocent.

293
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:47,627
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Could I talk to you about it, in private?

294
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,215
No. Because I got Colbert's wallet in my
hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.

295
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,471
- You think he gave it to him?
- I don't know.

296
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,759
But Oberst could have come along
after the crime, found it, picked it up.

297
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,225
- I don't know.
- That's what the boy said he did.

298
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,190
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I say different.

299
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,569
When I examined the deceased, it was
obvious the fatal blow was struck

300
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,358
from an angle of 17 degrees
from the right, which makes it

301
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,276
almost certain the person
who did it is right-handed.

302
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,946
- So what?
-  Harve's left-handed, Chief.

303
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,614
Everybody in town knows that.

304
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,750
We figured that out.
Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.

305
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,968
You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny
name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.

306
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:37,552
- What do they call you up there?
- They call me Mr. Tibbs!

307
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:41,719
Mr. Tibbs! Well, Mr. Wood, take
Mr. Tibbs, take him down to the depot.

308
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,809
And I mean, boy, like now!

309
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,276
I'll have the FBI lab
send you the report on this.

310
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,741
Not that it'll make
any difference.

311
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,698
I'll take that.

312
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,456
No, you won't.

313
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,293
I'm sending it in personally.

314
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,924
My God!

315
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,770
What kind of people are you?

316
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,482
What kind of a place is this?

317
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,272
My husband is dead.

318
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,945
Somebody in this town killed him!
I want you to find out who!

319
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,170
You gonna give me that?

320
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,265
No, I'm not.

321
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,387
Wood, you take him,

322
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,683
and you lock him up
for withholding evidence.

323
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,983
Go on, move! Put him with
his friend, Harvey Oberst!

324
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:29,080
Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains
to the hogs, that's for damn sure.

325
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:34,464
Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.
We got another customer.

326
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,668
Hey, man, not in here.

327
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:42,009
- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button.

328
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,095
Play it cool, boy.
Play it cool.

329
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,226
Hey!

330
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,521
- Hey!

331
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:58,731
What you doin'
wearin' white man's clothes?

332
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,700
Where d'you come from?

333
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,246
You deaf or somethin'?

334
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,661
Listen, I'm get...

335
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,121
Keep cool, Harvey.

336
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,671
I'm on your side.

337
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,048
Well, I don't need you!

338
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,101
I'm all you've got.

339
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,313
Police?

340
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,865
You're a cop?

341
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,611
- You're a cop.
- Mm-hm.

342
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,654
Yeah?

343
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,495
So, how come they locked you up?
How come they lock up a cop?

344
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,911
Who said they locked me up?

345
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,753
How come with all these empty cells here
they'd throw me in with you? You dig?

346
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,930
Look.

347
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,808
I already told 'em.

348
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,770
I see this fella lyin' on
the street there.

349
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,271
And there's this wallet
lyin' beside him.

350
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,063
Boy, I mean, I come into
this world outta luck.

351
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,860
Here's the first good thing
to come my way. And I pick it up.

352
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,288
But when I see whose
wallet it is...

353
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,746
I mean, I start to sweat. But I heard
about this new chief. This Gillepsie?

354
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,039
Got no more smile
than a turnip.

355
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:43,460
So I cut across the fields, headin' for the
line, and got myself as far as the bridge

356
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,799
before Gillespie grabbed me.

357
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,465
What time did you find the wallet?

358
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,268
Well, I ain't got no watch, but it must have
been after two, by the courthouse clock.

359
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,775
I'm interested in eleven to two.
Where were you?

360
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,688
Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.
I got there about ten.

361
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,778
- What time'd you leave?
- Closin'. Must have been one.

362
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,116
- Anybody can swear for you?
- Packy, Burt, Les.

363
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,997
Ever been in trouble
with the police before?

364
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,126
Come on.

365
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,541
I could ask at the desk,
you know.

366
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,842
Well, they brought
me in one time.

367
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,013
- On account of this Delores Purdy.
- On what charge?

368
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,943
Well, uh, this Delores,
she, uh...

369
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,362
she's real proud of what nature
done for her, you know?

370
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,826
And, uh...

371
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,491
Well, we was on a date
up to Clarke's Point, and, uh...

372
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,668
she says, uh...

373
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,089
Anyway, she asks me,
she says, uh...

374
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,547
"Don't you think I got
a classy build?"

375
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,882
And I say "Sure."

376
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,843
And so she starts to show me.

377
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,385
But I didn't do nothin' wrong.

378
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,101
I just didn't stop her from
tryin' to prove her point.

379
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,938
Then this cop, Sam Wood,

380
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,275
comes chargin' outta the bush
and hauls me in.

381
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,277
He let you go, didn't he?

382
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,702
Told me not to mess with her no more.
She lives on Third, a block from me.

383
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,784
Traipsin' around in the altogether.
With the lights on.

384
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,041
Now, somebody sure oughta
make her stop doin' that.

385
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,920
Come here.

386
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,417
Let me see your right hand.

387
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,673
- What you doin'?
- Hold still.

388
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,956
All right now, give him
the waiver for false arrest.

389
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,538
<i>Forget it.</i>

390
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,625
I'm askin' you to sign it.
Please.

391
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,044
Give him a pen.
Give him a pen.

392
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,432
All right. Let him out.

393
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:54,276
You'll be able to catch
the 12:10 train.

394
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,282
It wouldn't be a bad idea to
change the charge against Oberst.

395
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:05,375
He was nowhere near the scene of the
crime, and I think he can prove it.

396
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,749
- I bet you know when Colbert was killed.
- About 12:30.

397
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:13,887
- While Harvey was still shooting pool.
- Wait a minute. I'll get it.

398
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,634
There's cue chalk under his nails,
not dried blood.

399
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,973
- Thank God I don't live in Philadelphia.
- One more thing.

400
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,685
Colbert wasn't killed
where the body was found.

401
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,477
- What do you mean?
- He was killed then moved to Main Street.

402
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,914
- Courtney?
- Yes, sir?

403
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,752
Change the charge to theft.

404
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,209
D'you mean Harve?

405
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,046
Who the hell else do
we have back there?!

406
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,302
Yes, sir.

407
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,515
Hey.

408
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,518
Didn't I ask you to fix that gate?

409
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:08,562
No, not me, sir. Must have been
my brother Harold. He's on days.

410
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,610
Harold.

411
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,706
Police department.

412
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,959
Yes, he's here.
Hold on, sir.

413
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,287
Mayor's on the line, Chief.

414
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:40,070
What's all this Mrs. Colbert's been
tellin' me about a... a cover-up arrest?

415
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,536
No, ma'am.
We ain't had no cover-up.

416
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,916
In fact, we just dropped the
charges for insufficient evidence.

417
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,628
Mrs. Colbert, I told you
he was nobody's man.

418
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,841
I came by to make it
as clear as I possibly can

419
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:01,175
that I do not want that Negro
officer taken off this case.

420
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,683
Negro officer?

421
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,930
Yeah, well, he, uh...
He comes from up North, you see.

422
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,691
And he was, uh, kinda...

423
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,277
- passin' through...
- If it wasn't for him,

424
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:24,910
your impartial chief of police would
still have the wrong man behind bars.

425
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,911
I want that officer
given a free hand.

426
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:34,671
Otherwise, I will pack up
my husband's engineers...

427
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,176
and leave you...

428
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,180
to yourselves.

429
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,856
Mrs. Colbert, now don't you
worry about a thing.

430
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,143
Believe me, we're gonna
take care of everything.

431
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,771
Bill?

432
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,948
I wanna see you come through
this now, you hear?

433
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,618
Even if we have to step
on Endicott's toes?

434
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,752
Even that.

435
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,005
But do it fast.

436
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,209
All right.

437
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,174
Now, Bill, how about
this here Negro officer?

438
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,839
Mrs. Colbert seems
to have confidence in him.

439
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,600
Oh, he ain't nothin'.
Some kind of a...

440
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,848
some kind of a homicide expert.
But I don't need him.

441
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,232
You mean you don't want him.
But you do need him.

442
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,450
Now look, Bill.
Suppose he turns up the killer.

443
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:50,956
He has no police power here. He's gonna
have to hand him over on a platter, right?

444
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,865
That's right.

445
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,626
And if he fails,
you're off the hook,

446
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,913
'cause it was Mrs. Colbert's idea
in the first place.

447
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,457
See what I mean?

448
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,718
Oh, yeah.

449
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,005
Works out all the way around, Bill.
For all of us.

450
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,308
Excuse me.

451
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,384
Any reason why you have
to leave today?

452
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,179
There's lots of reasons.

453
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:53,351
What would you say if
I asked you to stay for a while?

454
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,386
No.

455
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,868
This town needs a
factory, Virgil.

456
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,575
Colbert come down
from Chicago to build it.

457
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,913
I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.
Half of them'd be colored.

458
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:22,080
- Know what that means?
- Probably got him killed.

459
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:26,217
That's what Mrs. Colbert thinks.
She wants us to catch her a killer.

460
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,094
No killer, no factory.

461
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:33,508
Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta
colored people. You follow me?

462
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,971
- I'm going home, man.
- They're your people.

463
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:41,482
Not mine... yours.
You made this scene.

464
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,316
- What do you want me to do? Beg you?
- Look, I've had your town up to here!

465
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:51,155
Boy, it would give me a world of
satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!

466
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,742
My father used to say that.

467
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:07,132
- Even did, once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.

468
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,928
Now you listen to me.

469
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,714
Just once in my life
I'm gonna hold my temper.

470
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,054
I'm tellin' you that
you're gonna stay.

471
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,722
You'll stay here if I have to have your
chief remind you what he told you to do.

472
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,982
But I don't think
I have to do that, you see?

473
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,691
No. Because you're so damned smart.
You're smarter than any white man.

474
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,481
You're just gonna stay here
and show us all.

475
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:34,994
You could never live with yourself
unless you could put us all to shame.

476
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,414
You wanna know something, Virgil?

477
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:45,125
I don't think that you could let
an opportunity like that pass by.

478
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,454
Jess?

479
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,749
Jess, this is, uh...

480
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,589
This is Virgil.
He's workin' for me.

481
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,592
Give him somethin' that runs.
Fix him up.

482
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:39,258
What I fix, runs.
Who pays?

483
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,343
Police.

484
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,353
Well, you know
where to find me.

485
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,982
What you doin' here, man?

486
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,268
Policeman.

487
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,653
You're a policeman here in Sparta?

488
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,692
They've got a murder
they don't know what to do with.

489
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,451
They need a whipping boy.

490
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,212
You got a roof?

491
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:55,009
No. I'll find a motel.

492
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,221
Viola... We got company.

493
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,443
Know what's gonna happen?

494
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,696
He gonna get hisself killed.

495
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,274
You watch and see he don't.

496
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,116
I'm aware of the risk, Tom. But, like
it or not, we're stuck with him.

497
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,327
Not if the chief here
is right on the ball.

498
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,829
What do you say, Chief?

499
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:33,273
You got that old killer all lined
up in your front sights, hm?

500
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,217
I'm workin' on it.

501
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:39,595
Tom, climb off
of Gillespie's back now.

502
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,848
You know damn well we didn't
hire him off a homicide squad.

503
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,637
Yeah, well,
it's gonna be his week.

504
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,682
'Cause Colbert's only the start.

505
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,192
I say this nigger won't
live past Saturday.

506
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:09,079
Mrs. Colbert, can you tell me
about your husband's enemies?

507
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:13,371
That's Endicott.
He's been fighting us all the way.

508
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:17,587
He sits up on his hill
and runs this county.

509
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,423
Or did, until we moved in.

510
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:27,928
Did your husband tell you
where he was going last night?

511
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:33,975
He said he wasn't sleepy.
I went to bed.

512
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,981
What time was that?

513
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:40,235
A little after 11, I think.

514
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,864
Did he call you, or anybody
on your staff, after 11?

515
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,696
No.

516
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,122
Maybe the elevator boy
can tell us what time he went out.

517
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,708
They put it on
self-service after ten.

518
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,049
Did your husband use a car here?

519
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,337
Find anything?

520
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,175
- Whoever killed Colbert drove this oar.
- How do you know?

521
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,350
Where you goin'?

522
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:37,645
I'd drive up there, but I'm sure you
don't want me running up there by myself.

523
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,808
- Up where?
- Eric Endicott's.

524
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,477
Endicott's?!
Come on, now!

525
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,489
None of that for you,
huh, Virgil?

526
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,503

Listen. You know
something I don't know?

536
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,894
I found a piece of osmunda
in Colbert's car.

537
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,690
- A piece of what?
- On the brake pedal. Osmunda. Fern root.

538
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:54,531
Fern root?
Oh, is Mr. Endicott here?

539
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:58,368
Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.
Would you follow me, please?

540
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:26,475
- Gillespie.
- Mr. Endicott.

541
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,736
This here's Virgil.

542
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:33,573
- Mr. Tibbs.
- How do you do, sir?

543
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,362
Oh, may I have Henry fetch you
somethin'? Some light refreshment?

544
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:42,408
- No, thank you. We're all right...
- I'll have something cold, soft. Anything.

545
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,498
Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.
I'll have one, too.

546
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,754
Yes, sir.

547
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,168
I didn't know it was possible
to grow this species locally.

548
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,632
- Oh, you like flowers?
- I do.

549
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,092
Mr. Tibbs, do you know
anything about orchids?

550
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:01,226
- Not very much, but I do like them.
- Well, let me show you.

551
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,231
Endicott's folly.

552
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,735
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful. It's breathtaking.

553
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,836
Have you a favorite,
Mr. Tibbs?

554
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,769
Well, I'm partial to
any of the epiphytics.

555
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,405
Why, isn't that remarkable!

556
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,994
That of all the orchids in this place,
you should prefer the epiphytics.

557
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,253
I wonder if you know why.

558
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,373
Maybe it would be helpful
if you'd tell me.

559
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,463
Because, like the Negro,

560
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:38,506
they need care and
feedin' and cultivatin'.

561
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,641
And that takes time.

562
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:46,722
That's somethin' you can't make
some people understand.

563
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,357
That's somethin'
Mr. Colbert didn't realize.

564
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,576
Is this what the
epiphytics root in?

565
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,408
My point! They thrive on it.

566
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,323
Take it away from them,
they do poorly.

567
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,746
- What do you call this material?
- That's osmunda. Fern root.

568
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,798
Well, we don't wanna take any
more of your time, Mr. Endicott.

569
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,807
Why'd you two come here?

570
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,025
To ask you about Mr. Colbert.

571
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,161
Let me understand this.

572
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,120
You two came here...
to question me?

573
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,046
Well, your...

574
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,377
your attitudes, Mr. Endicott,

575
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,010
your points of view,
are a matter of record.

576
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:03,428
Some people... let us say the
people who work for Mr. Colbert...

577
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:08,221
might reasonably regard you as the person
least likely to mourn his passing.

578
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,646
We were just trying
to clarify some of the evidence.

579
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:19,607
Was Mr. Colbert ever in this greenhouse?
Say, last night, about midnight?

580
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,864
Gillespie?

581
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,999
Yeah?

582
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:34,038
- You saw it.
- Oh, I saw it.

583
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,711
What are you gonna do about it?

584
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,795
I don't know.

585
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,807
I'll remember that.

586
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:54,225
There was a time...
when I could have had you shot.

587
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:29,510
- You better clear out. And I mean fast!
- What about that speech you gave me?

588
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:32,304
I didn't know you'd slap any white man!
Least of all Endicott!

589
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,940
All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.

590
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:40,445
I can pull that fat cat down.
I can bring him right off this hill!

591
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,691
Oh, boy.

592
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,495
Man, you're just like
the rest of us.

593
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,077
Ain't ya?

594
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:10,050
It's all my fault.

595
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,181
But there's no point
in ducking it.

596
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,100
It's gonna be tough
to keep you in your job now.

597
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,528
Now look Bill. I don't have to tell you
how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.

598
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,864
- No. I already told him to go.
- All right.

599
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,076
Now, Mrs. Colbert is not
gonna be back till Thursday.

600
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,286
You catch your guilty
party by then,

601
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:38,044
she won't hold it against us we had
to send Tibbs home for his own good.

602
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,877
But you gotta do it, you hear?

603
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,133
I hear.

604
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,257
Bill?

605
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,141
What's made you change
your mind about Tibbs?

606
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,394
Who says I have?

607
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,514
Last chief we had,

608
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,062
he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he
slapped Endicott, claimed self-defense.

609
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,543
- Gillespie here.
- Courtney here, sir.

610
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:26,960
<i>- Did you take Virgil down the depot?
- No, sir. He just plain wouldn't go.</i>

611
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,255
- <i>Shagbag saw him headin' to River Road.</i>
- Check.

612
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,373
Hey! C'mon!
C'mon!

613
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,439
Hey! C'mon!

614
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,389
OK, black boy. We come here
to teach you some manners.

615
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:32,528
We told you about them bad manners,
boy. You better put that down.

616
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,449
Why don't you
come and get it, baby?

617
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:05,061
C'mon, man. You ain't nothin'.
C'mon. Let's get him.

618
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,646
We'll put that round your neck.

619
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,026
Hit him, man!
Get him from the side!

620
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,294
Get behind him!

621
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,170
All right, hold it!

622
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,810
All right, boys.

623
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,685
You've had your fun.
Now go on, you just run along home.

624
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,610
Nigger-lover.

625
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:13,667
- I didn't catch what you said.
- Get rid of the nigger.

626
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,130
You don't... we will.

627
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:21,842
Now, is that a suggestion,
or is that an order?

628
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,098
That's a warnin'!

629
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,011
I see.

630
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,931
I see.

631
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:40,485
Shut up and take this trash outta here!
Come on, move it and go!

632
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,167
Well, you finally get
the message, Virgil?!

633
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,175
May I get in?

634
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,975
- Thought you left town.
- Not yet.

635
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:19,897
Could you follow the same route you
followed Tuesday night, same speed?

636
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,565
- Why?
- Why not?

637
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:30,282
- Maybe I better check with the chief.
- I wouldn't want him to slap you down

638
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:33,042
for steppin' outta line,

639
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,999
makin' decisions on
your own, and all that.

640
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:40,667
He don't knock me outta my socks.

641
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,547
Let's get rollin', Virgil.

Take ten minutes to get myself a
king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.

657
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,838
That is, if that peckerwood
ain't sold out again.

658
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:11,800
- Can I bring you anything?
- No. I'm coming in.

659
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,025
I thought I told you to
get outta here.

660
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,031
- I'm not ready to leave.
- I was gonna tell you, Chief.

661
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,069
- You forget about those four maniacs?
- I need more time.

662
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:34,205
- Do I have to put you on the train myself?!
- I guess so!

663
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,457
Whoa.

664
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,625
All right, Virgil.
Just what the hell do you want?

665
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:46,926
I wanna know exactly where Sam was
at all times on the night of the murder.

666

668

Virgil, if you get killed, we'll have
one hell of a mess in this town.

669
01:15:58,706 --> 01:15:59,706
You know that?

670
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,526
I know.

671
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,836
Got some real luscious cream pie
for you tonight, Sam.

672
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,968
I mean Officer Wood.
Just like you always order.

673
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:33,597
You know I don't eat that stuff. The chief
likes his boys streamlined. Right, Chief?

674
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,259
Why don't you shut up, Sam?

675
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:41,101
- All right, what'll you have, Virgil?
- I ain't servin' him!

676
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:53,818
Tuesday night you walked
out of here at 2:40. Right?

677
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,078
Right on the button.

678
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,490
Two minutes from now.

679
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,965
That's for him.

680
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:35,026
Now, what'd you do
when you came out that night?

681
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,408
Well, I picked up the
radio and called in.

682
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,198
Do it, please.

683
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,867
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

684
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:55,346
Uh... Wood to radio.
I'm leavin' Compton's now.

685
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,758
<i>Sam, look sharp.
Gillespie's sniff in' around.</i>

686
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,018
Gimme that thing!

687
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:05,682
Courtney, your brother says I didn't tell
him to fix that hinge, so I told <i>you.</i>

688
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,725
Do you read me,
Courtney?

689
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:10,941
<i>- Oh, I'll get right on it, Chief.</i>
- I'd do that if I were you.

690
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,197
<i>Yes, sir. Ten-four.</i>

691
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:36,216
All right, you can move us.
Officer Wood.

692
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,429
- Why'd you do that, Sam?
- Do what?

693
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,515
Change your route
back there at the corner.

694
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,849
Who says I changed?

695
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,573
Look, I oughta know what I did!
Chief, do I have to put up with this?

696
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,200
Do I work for you,
or do I work for him?

697
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,207
Good night, gentlemen.

698
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,609
I don't know.

699
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,900
- I don't know.
- Well, I appreciate anything you can do.

700
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:25,655
- This is highly irregular.
- Yeah, I know that.

701
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:31,043
Showing our depositors' accounts?
Hm. I don't know.

702
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:37,667
- You sure this is an official request?
- Yes. It's official, yes.

703
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:44,715
- You willing to put that in writing?
- Yeah. I'll put it in writing.

704
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,135
On police department letterhead?

705
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:50,680
I would write it on the head
of a pin if you want it there.

706
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:54,942
- I gotta have somethin' for the file.
- I realize that, but I'm in a hurry.

707
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,104
Well, we'll see.

708
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:04,034
He's had an account with us
for several years now.

709
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,070
That so?

710
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,206
Not a large account.

711
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,126
Never more than... Yeah.

712
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:20,084
$208.

713
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,971
That was back in '62.
September.

714
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:29,390
I am not interested in '62 September.
I am interested in yesterday.

715
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,270
Yesterday? Well...

716
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:37,109
Well.

717
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:42,398
According to this,
he made a deposit of... $632.

718
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,532
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

719
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:48,571
- Thank you.
- Must have been when I was out to lunch.

720
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,365
A deposit that size,
I'd remember.

721
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:55,127
Oh, you'll send me that letter
for the file, you hear?

722
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:59,415
I'll tell you, baby brother, the chief
didn't like him, not even from the first.

723
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:04,177
- Morning.
- Where do you think you're goin'?

724
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,839
It's all right. Let him go.

725
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:16,311
I just talked to the FBI lab. We can
prove Colbert was in that greenhouse.

726
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,646
Endicott's covering up.

727
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,858
I'm afraid you're too late.
We already got the guilty man.

728
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,614
- Who?
- Sam.

729
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,447
- Sam?
- That's right.

730
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,790
Our man is Endicott.

731
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:37,328
You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?

732
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,794
And yesterday he makes
a big cash deposit at the bank.

733
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,379
If I told you once,
I told you a hundred times

734
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:47,092
that I won that matchin' quarters
and halves. It took me three years!

735
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,302
Then why was it in big bills?
I checked.

736
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,436
Because whenever I got enough change,
I'd trade it in on $20 bills.

737
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:56,643
And when I got up to $600, I took
it down and put it in the bank.

738
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:01,811
The day Colbert was killed, he cashed
a check for $900, $600 of which is gone,

739
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:06,323
$300 of which I believe you left in the
wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!

740
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:11,079
- What kinda man do you think I am?!
- Now, don't you push me, boy!

741
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,918
Now listen.

742
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,670
If you weren't
suspicious of Sam here,

743
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:25,005
why did you question him last
night when he changed his route?

744
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:30,130
- I knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?

745
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:34,177
He was afraid I'd see some naked
white girl down the block.

746
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,687
- What?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.

747
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:41,191
She parades around in the nude at
night to get her kicks. That's...

748
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:44,236
- How do you know?
- I know.

749
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,613
Well, I know. Do you understand?

750
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,867
I know that Colbert
cashed a check for $900.

751
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,619
I know that Sam made a
big cash deposit.

752
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,954
I know that you caught him in a lie.
And I know that's enough for me.

753
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,456
C'mon, Sam.

754
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,713
Martin, lock him up.

755
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,377
Well?

756
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,056
Well... you're making a mistake.

757
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,180
Don't you bet against it.

758
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,359
You can catch your
train now, Virgil.

759
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,293
Tibbs?

760
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,506
Do you think Sam did it?

761
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,805
- Where do I find the chief?
- What's it all about?

762
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:02,644
My business.

763
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,860
Hey, look, Purdy.

764
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:11,069
Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.

765
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,202
What I got to say,
I say to the chief.

766
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,035
It's about Sam Wood.

767
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,700
All right.

768
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:26,372
<i>Yeah?</i>

769
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,803
Purdy's out here, sir.
It's about Sam.

770
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,464
All right.
Send him in.

771
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:49,110
She is gonna have a baby.
Sam Wood's baby.

772
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,495
Well, ask her yourself
if you don't believe me!

773
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:01,532
What are you doin' here?

774
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,146
It's important that I hear this.

775
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:12,505
I ain't talkin' about this
with him in the room.

776
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:21,052
- Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!
- You be sensible. I'm a police officer.

777
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:26,060
You gonna get him outta here,
or do I gotta do it?!

778
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:31,737
You ain't gonna do nothin'.
You just stand there and shut up.

779
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:43,081
Sit down, little girl.

780
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:47,999
All right, now.

781
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:54,752
You tell me... all about it.
Just tell me how it happened.

782
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,390
Oh, come on.
Come on, girl, speak!

783
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:03,678
- Well, you know how hot it's been.
- Yeah.

784
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,347
Nights, they aren't any better.

785
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,434
My brother works nights.

786
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,942
He leaves me all alone.

787
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:17,153
This particular night,
I go out on the porch.

788
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:22,079
I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be
if I had a fountain drink.

789
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:26,617
Sam comes down our road.

790
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,920
Just like he comes every night.

791
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:35,297
Passin' like a lord
in that fine, big, shiny car.

792
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:41,010
Only, this time he stops.

793
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:45,015
He's got a nice face,
don't you think, Chief?

794
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,138
So he stopped.

795
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,320
-  He says...
- What? I didn't hear what you said.

796
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,573
<i>He says...</i>

797
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:01,284
"Hey, little girl,

798
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,535
you know what
the coolest spot in town is?"

799
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:11,204
And I said "No, Sam.
I guess I don't."

800
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:16,375
And he said...
"The cemetery. That's where."

801
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,757
"Know why?"

802
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:26,762
“Cause they got all of them
big, cool tombstones."

803
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:30,807
"Ever stretch out
on a tombstone, Delores?"

804
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:35,603
"Feel all that nice, cool marble
along your body?"

805
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:44,533
- He said that?
- You hear, Chief? You hear?

806
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,788
Yeah, I hear.
I hear.

807
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:52,586
All right. Sam comes along and stops in
front of your house and talks. What else?

808
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,669
Well, come on now, girl.
What else? What else? What else?

809
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,962
- Then I went for a ride with him.
- Where'd you go?

810
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,174
The cemetery.

811
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:06,433
So, Wood took you to the cemetery
in the patrol car, right?

812
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:10,221
And then things went a bit too far.
Is that what you're sayin'?

813
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,606
Did they get a little
bit outta line?

814
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,608
Come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?

815
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,769
Come on, girl!
Is it or ain't it?

816
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:20,655
- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!

817
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,235
Now, I got one more question.
Very important.

818
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,196
Did he force you,
or did you let him?

819
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,908
Don't mean a damn whether she
let him or not! She is still 16!

820
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:34,044
In this state, that's rape!
I know the plain law on that!

821
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:38,173
I know the laws in the state
of Mississippi, thank you!

822
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,213
- Are you sure you're pregnant?
- Yes, I am pregnant!

823
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,557
- Courtney!
- Yes, sir?

824
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,892
Better get in here with
a pad and a pencil.

825
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:01,238
Come on in. I want you
to take this all down.

826
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:05,989
You had no right to keep a nigger
in the room, shame my little sister.

827
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,534
You had no right.

828
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,998
Virge, what's happenin'?

829
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,457
- Hi, Harve.
- How are you?

830
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,214
- Fine.
- Man, uh...

831
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:26,506
- You sure saved my hide.
- Listen, Harvey. Man, uh...

832
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:32,512
If a guy knocks up a girl in this
town, where can he go for help?

833
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:38,733
- Barbershop.
- Barbershop?

834
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:42,775
Borrow Mr. Fanning's razor
and cut your throat!

835
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,440
Well...

836
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,535
But suppose
Mr. Fanning's razor is too dull.

837
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,322
Suppose he's got some
real money to spread around.

838
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:59,287
Uh...

839
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,331
Well, uh...

840
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,584
There used to be a colored gal.

841
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:11,347
But she kept bumpin' her price, and I
don't know if she's still in business.

842
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:15,138
- What's her name?
- Well, I ain't never had to look her up.

843
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:19,683
But, uh... Packy might know.

844
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:23,187
Where do I find Packy?

845
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:28,029
Down at the pool hall.
But, man, he wouldn't tell you.

846
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,910
Not unless I say so.

847
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:34,369
And how am I gonna say so
locked up in here?

848
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:38,206
Suppose I get word to Packy that you
wanna see him? Have him come here?

849
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,007
Will you let him
bring me a cheeseburger?

850
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:50,760
Onions?

851
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,175
Now you're talkin'!

852
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:56,219
Uh... Virge?

853
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,616
A little careless,
ain't you, Virgil?

854
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:56,781
Parked in the road, you could get yourself
killed. Anybody'd know where you are.

855
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:02,999
- You know what this land is?
- Yeah. It's the site for the new factory.

856
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:09,635
I found a piece of wood in Colbert's
scalp. The lab identified it as pine.

857
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:14,299
Three people saw Colbert drive by...
alone... on the way back from Endicott's.

858
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:19,140
Colbert must have picked up somebody
in town and then come out here.

859
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:22,101
I tell you he didn't
pick up nobody.

860
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:26,234
Sam followed him here, come up behind
him, just like I come up behind you.

861
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:30,022
- I heard you. Colbert would have too.
- He turned and he got smashed!

862
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:32,282
He was hit from behind!

863
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,740
If Delores Purdy hadn't come in,
I never would have seen the truth.

864
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:39,577
I was hung up trying to get Endicott,
for personal reasons.

865
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,159
Do you know what
I'm gonna do, Virgil?

866
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:45,625
I'm gonna take you to Brownsville
and put you on the bus myself.

867
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:49,462
You aren't taking me anywhere.
You dig? You're holding the wrong man!

868
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:54,471
The wrong man?! I got the motive, which
is money, and the body, which is dead!

869
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,973
- What makes you so sure?
- Why do you doubt it?!

870
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,430
Because Colbert was killed <i>here!</i>

871
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:02,812
Then driven back to town in his own
car and dumped on the streets.

872
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:05,770
Sam couldn't have
driven two cars!

873
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,597
What do you want?

874
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,594
Give me till morning.

875
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,556
You know...

876
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:31,352
You know, Virgil,
you are among the chosen few.

877
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,106
How's that?

878
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:41,324
Well, I think that you're the first
human being that's ever been in here.

879
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:49,169
Well, you can't be
too careful, man.

880
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,174
You know a lotta things,
don't you?

881
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:59,338
Well, just what do you know
about insomnia?

882
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,474
Bourbon can't cure it.

883
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:13,560
Well... that's for sure.

884
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:18,649
Now look.
I got no wife. I got no kids.

885
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:24,787
Boy, I got a town that...
don't want me.

886
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:33,080
And I got an air conditioner
that I have to oil myself,

887
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:37,258
and a desk with a busted leg.
And on top of that, I got...

888
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,837
this, uh...

889
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:44,057
place.

890
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:47,936
Now, don't you think that'd drive
a man to takin' a few drinks?

891
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:58,529
I'll tell you a secret.

892
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:00,782
Nobody comes here.

893
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:04,485
Never.

894
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,090
You married?

895
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,293
No.

896
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,805
Ever been?

897
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:27,842
No.

898
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:34,391
Ever been close to it?

899
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,948
Close to it.

900
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:59,674
Don't you get just...
a little lonely?

901
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,557
No lonelier than you, man.

902
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:17,105
Oh, now,
don't get smart, black boy.

903
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:22,613
I don't need it.

904
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,362
No pity, thank you.

905
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:37,170
No, thank you!

906
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:46,546
- Yeah?
- Chief?

907
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:50,637
- Yeah.
- You know where I can find Virgil?

908
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,677
Who are you?

909
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:57,270
Packy, Chief. Packy Harrison.
I'm a friend of Harve.

910
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:03,651
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

911
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:06,987
- Where you goin'?
- Where whitey ain't allowed.

912
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:12,076
- What the hell does that mean?
- You gave me till morning. Remember?

913
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:48,901
- Here's the car.
- He could have exchanged cars by now.

914
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:52,115
John, you stick here.
We'll keep cruisin'.

915
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:05,125
You find him,
come back for me, you hear?

916
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:12,389
That's her place, here.
You want me to wait?

917
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:16,895
No, thank you, Packy.
You go on home.

918
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:01,806
Mrs. Bellamy?

919
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:05,397
People around here
call me Mama Caleba.

920
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:10,106
Mama, I'm not from around here.
But you can put me on my train.

921
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:14,323
You talk crazy.
You gin-drunk?

922
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:18,156
Just homesick.

923
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:20,916
Lord, Lord!

924
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:24,579
Whisper two little words,
Mama, and I'm on my way.

925
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:30,923
Maybe... I don't want to sever
a beautiful child like you right out.

926
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:40,228
A man's name.

927
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:46,317
First name, last name.

928
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,901
The man who's paying you
for Delores Purdy's abortion.

929
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:53,657
You're the boy who
works for Mr. Charlie.

930
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:58,113
I thought that's who you was.

931
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:00,535
Why you wanna do that?

932
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:05,378
Why you wanna help the
police like that?

933
01:42:06,454 --> 01:42:09,298
They stealin' your soul.

934
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:12,677
They chew you up and
spit you out.

935
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:15,429
I'm not here to lay
a finger on you, Mama.

936
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:19,596
It's the white boy I want.

937
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:22,182
What you got against him?
He's paying for his fun.

938
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:25,770
How much? I bet you he's not
paying you more than a hundred.

939
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:29,519
You know how much he's got in his
pocket right now? More than $600!

940
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:34,611
That cracker?

941
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:37,948
- Where'd he come off getting 600?
- He killed Mr. Colbert.

942
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,208
You gone crazy out
of your mind.

943
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:47,211
Now listen.
Hear me good, Mama, please.

944
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,839
Don't make me have
to send you to jail.

945
01:42:50,956 --> 01:42:52,378
A lot you care!

946
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:56,296
There's white time in jail, and colored
time. The worst kind you can do

947
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,214
is colored time.

948
01:43:01,634 --> 01:43:05,013
Child... you promise...

949
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:09,559
give me understanding.

950
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:12,770
I got used to better.

951
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,402
You won't take it away?

952
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,987
I won't take it away.

953
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:27,168
Well... I don't know his name.

954
01:43:27,993 --> 01:43:31,418
But she's coming here tonight.

955
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,841
Get herself straight.

956
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:52,773
- Leave me alone! Let me go!
-  Let go of her!

957
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:56,735
- Let go of her!
- Let go of me!

958
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:01,535
Gonna teach you, boy!

959
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:05,331
No club this time, man?

960
01:44:06,031 --> 01:44:10,332
A gun's not smart. The way you
killed Colbert was much smarter.

961
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:13,422
You killed Colbert?!

962
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,585
He's crazy. Crazy.

963
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:42,284
OK, nigger.
Your time, nigger.

964
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:44,704
Look in her purse.

965
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:48,492
- What's that mean?
- She's got $100 to pay for an abortion.

966
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:51,376
Listen to that.
That's crazy.

967
01:44:51,535 --> 01:44:52,582
Money she got from Ralph.

968
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,799
You gonna listen to him?

969
01:44:56,957 --> 01:44:59,881
He got her to tell you
that Sam Wood did it.

970
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:02,096
He made a fool out
of you, Purdy.

971
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,308
- Delores?
- Liar!

972
01:45:07,927 --> 01:45:11,101
You stinkin' liar!

973
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:13,357
Gimme that purse!

974
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:31,785
You turned my little sister...
into a field slut?

975
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:37,005
<i>Lloyd! Lloyd!</i>

976
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:40,088
- Hey, man, stay back!
- He's got a gun!

977
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:44,513
He's dead.

978
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:59,190
When I left her house,
I was going to the diner.

979
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:02,402
Mr. Colbert drove by, so I hitched
a ride with him. That's all.

980
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:06,365
I said "I sure would like a job in that
new factory once you get started."

981
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:10,907
And he said "Sure." And I said
"Well, I wonder where it's gonna be."

982
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:15,920
He said that field we were comin' up to
was it, and he would stop and show me.

983
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:19,461
I said to myself
"Man, he's askin' for it."

984
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:23,761
I said "Now, Ralph,
all you gotta do when we get out...

985
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:29,385
is just sneak up behind him
and just... tap him."

986
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:34,643
"And then just claim that somebody
jumped us from the bushes."

987
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:41,862
That's all.

988
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:45,525
I didn't mean to kill him.

989
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:52,789
Yeah.

990
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:55,542
All right, Courtney.
That's enough.

991
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:09,052
All right. C'mon, Ralph.

992
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:24,697

993

01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:14,413

995
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:17,291
Here you are.

996
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:20,711
Thank you.

997
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:24,131
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

998
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,764
Virgil?

999
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:39,180
You take care. You hear?

01:48:44,018 --> 01:48:45,565

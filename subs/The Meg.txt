nothing new, my friend.</i><i>It just keeps getting worse.</i>D'Angelo, Marks,
talk to me.We've moved
to the sonar room.Just nine rescues so far.<i>It's a mess, man.</i><i>This is the worst
I've ever seen.</i>Help!Help!Somebody help me!Help! Who's there?I got
one more survivor.Heading back
to the rescue vehicle now.Marks. D'Angelo.<i>What the hell was that?</i>I have no idea.Listen.<i>Jonas, we got
something outside the ship.</i><i>There's something out there.</i>Here.You okay, pal?Oh, my God.<i>Something's crushing the hull.</i>Get back to
the rescue vehicle. Now.We're right behind you.You guys, move!Got him. Slide him up.Marks. D'Angelo. Report.You almost here?<i>Jonas, listen to me.
We're trapped!</i>What?The impact jammed the hatch!Coming back.<i>The sub
is starting to collapse.</i>Marks!<i>Jonas,
we need you down here</i>before it's too late.The sub's been breached.<i>There's water everywhere.</i><i>Jonas,
the room is flooding.</i><i>Marks, we gotta
get this hatch open.</i><i>Come on, Jonas.
Where are you?</i>- <i>It's not gonna work!</i>
- <i>Let us out!</i><i>Jonas, hurry, please!</i><i>We just need
more time! Don't leave us!</i><i>Jonas!</i><i>Let us know
when you're here!</i><i>Don't give up!</i><i>Jonas, please!</i><i>Come down here, now!
Where are you?</i><i>Jonas!</i>You've lost your mind!Back off, Heller.If we go back, everyone dies.Everyone.What have you done?Are we living the dream here
or what?Welcome to <i>Mana One,</i>
Mr. Morris.Get that thing away from me.What are you doing?Come on, bring it in.
There we go.Good to see you again,
Mr. Morris.- Yeah.
- This way, please.Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that? Sandalwood?It's impressive so far,
I'll say.Oh, here they are.Do you remember
my daughter Suyin?Our chief marine biologist.Hi.Sorry, what was that?- I didn't catch it.
- Uh...She says she likes your hat.- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.Yeah.- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah.Your granddaughter's
a pistol.Okay.What have we here?This is, um,really ugly.You know, I realize thatwe're under construction
and everything,but I really think thata world-class
research institutedeserves
a world-class entrance.Yeah, I couldn't agree more.<i>O-Level.</i>Whoa!Welcome to the O-Level.Nice.This is
our central hub,from which
researchers will accessall five labs
once it's finished.Wow!Oh, look at that.That's not something
you see every day.Did you have
those whales here on cue?I might have lured them
with some whale songs.This is Lucy
and her daughter Gracie.Incredible.Wow!<i>Dive control level.</i>- Here we are.
- Please.Follow me quickly.
I hope we are on time.Come on in.Oh.Oh, man.I'd like you
to meet our engineerand sub designer, Jaxx.Hey, Doc.- Hello.
- Hi.Doctor Heller.
Our medical officer.Nice to meet you.You're like Bones, huh?DJ here pilots
our remote explorer.How's it going?You're my first billionaire.And of course, Mac,
our station chief.Mr. Morris, just in time.So I keep hearing.Try that.Just in time for what?<i>Good morning,
Mr. Morris.</i>Lori Taylor,
our mission pilot.<i>Hi, Mr. Morris.</i>Welcome on board.
It's good to have you.<i>Hey.</i>How's it going down there?Where'd you learn
how to pilot a sub?<i>I spent ten years
with a certain</i>whale-saving
environmental groupthat shall remain unnamed
for legal reasons.Yeah, ask her
if she ever blew upa whaling ship
with a homemade torpedo.Hey.No.That is a good hire.<i>Eleven in two.</i><i>Water temperature
is at six degrees.</i>Mac, we are
through the thermocline.We are approaching
11,000 meters.One hundred meters
from the bottom.<i>Maybe.</i><i>Maybe from the bottom.</i>"Maybe"? What does
he mean, "maybe"?Come on. Look at this.Since 1875,we've all believed
the Mariana Trenchwas the deepest place
on Earth.I've had a theory that
what we think is the bottommight actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide.Beneath that cloud,and a freezing
cold thermocline,there could be
a completely new world.Wow!The <i>Origin</i> is about to see
if my father is right.If there is warm water below,that means we're going to be
the first to see it.And what if you're wrong?Then you have wasted
$1.3 billion.You're kidding.He's kidding, right?Copy that.Wait. What?Ten meters.
Approaching boundary.Hovering at five meters.Full stop.Final checks.- Jaxx?
- Good to go.- Doc?
- Crew are go.- DJ?
- Sub and rover are a go.<i>Origin</i> crew,we are go for insertion.Insertion.Is everything sexual
with you guys?Sex, food, power and...Money.Blow it up now.<i>Dive control,</i>we are a go for... insertion.We're in.You guys, we're in.<i>It's a cloud.
It is not the bottom.</i>Lori, be careful.
We don't know the depth<i>on the other side of this.</i><i>The sea floor could come
right up on you.</i><i>Copy that, Mac.
We're ready.</i>You guys,
we are through!<i>I have multiple
small sonar contacts.</i><i>There is life down here.</i><i>Congratulations!</i>Deploying the lights.Lights deployed.
I'm gonna come around.Whoa!Oh, my goodness.- Wow!
- Whoa!Mac, tell me
you're getting this.We're getting
all of it, Lori.Got a lot of
smiling faces up here.DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover.Copy.Launch is all yours.Okay.Rover isfree.Copy.<i>Water temperature</i><i>below three degrees Celsius.</i>How is this possible?This ecosystem
is completely cut offfrom the rest of the oceanby the freezing
cold thermocline.We should find
all sorts of speciescompletely unknown to science.Sounds like a good investment.Lori, I have a contact.Bearing zero eight zero.Huh. It's big.Oh, it's huge.And it's moving fast.DJ,
is the rover seeing this?Negative.Let me try
and bring up some more lights.Rover One, <i>signal interrupted.</i>Whoa! I just lost telemetry.What the hell?<i>Origin,</i> recommendan immediate right turn
to three-five-zero.<i>This could be a landslide.</i>Last time I checked,
landslides don't make<i>90-degree turns.</i>It's right on us!
It's right on us!What the hell was that?Lori, what's going on
down there?You guys...- What?
- Come look at this.Whoa!What could do that
to the rover?I don't think
I wanna know.It's coming back.Oh, my God!<i>Let's get out of here.
Blow the tanks.</i><i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>- <i>It's not starting!</i>
- <i>Mac, help!</i>- Whole system's down!
- Oh, my God.<i>Oh, my God. DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i><i>Jonas was right.</i><i>Jonas was right! Do you co...</i>Lori, come in.<i>Origin,</i> can you hear me?<i>Origin,</i> please respond.- Come on.
- Lori, come in.Wall, can you hear me?Toshi?Gather around, people.
Options.Not great.We know they're alive.I've still got telemetry
on their vitals.How long do they have?Maybe 18 hours.Ballast valves
are jammed,which means
it can't rise by itself.If we attempt to tow it,it's fifty-fifty
that the tanks will explode,and breach the capsule.- Can't we go hatch-to-hatch?
- Not a chance.The external camera's
showing severe hatch damage.We have to try something.They're six miles downand no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth.Well, that's not exactly true.No. No way.We can handle this.Not at 11,000 meters,
you can't.We've gone 5,000 meters.
8,000 meters.At some point,
it just becomes a number.Why don't you try this number?Three. That's how many people
have actually attempteda rescue below 10,000 meters.And the number one.That's how many are left alive
to talk about it.One man. Jonas Taylor.And look what happened
to that one manthe last time he went
to these depths.He saved eleven people,including you, Heller.
That's what happened.He left our friends to die,because he had
pressure-induced psychosis.Come on, Heller.
That was your diagnosis.Jonas said
something attacked them.Something big enough to
take out a nuclear submarine.He's a drunk.You're not listening!
You're not listening!He washed up on a beach
in Thailand.- Did you hear what Lori said?
- I'm listening. I heard it.- Were you there?
- That's enough.We all heard
Lori's last transmission.We have to considerthat <i>Origin</i> may have
encounteredsomething similar to what
Jonas Taylor described.Something he was able
to escape from.<i>Ba!</i> Please.Prep the helicopter.We must go to Thailand.Your boat,she's killing me.Number one engine
slips out of the gear,and there's some leak
in the hydraulics.Hey, I'll take a look
at it tonight.That's what you said
last nightand the night before that,and the night before that.Hey, I'm working up to it.You drink too much.Hey, now
you're only saying thatbecause I literally have
a beer in my hand.You always have beer
in your hand.You know why?Because I drink too much?Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening.You know
I like to make an entrance.Hell, Mac, after five years,just showing up
is making an entrance.What? You're living
above a bar? Really?Figured it was the only way
to get you to come visit.Jonas,
allow me to introduce...It's an honor to meet you,
Doctor Zhang.Always had a tremendous
respect for your work.You're too kind, Mr. Taylor.Yeah, no, I'm not.
You're a good man.Hey, can I offer
either of you two a beer?'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.It's not a social call, Jonas.You mean you didn't helicopter
in just to say "hi"?You wound me, Mac.- We have a serious...
- Problem?Thought so.Just like you knowI don't dive anymore.Done being responsible
for people, Mac.Mr. Taylor...Hey, I mean no offense,
Doctor Zhang.I mean, if there was
two people on this planetthat could get me
back into the water,it's probably you two.But you can't.You're gonna tell me your
problem, and I'll say no.You're gonna offer me money.I'll still say no.You're gonna appeal
to my better nature,and I'm gonna say no.Because I don't have one.So I say,
why don't we sit down?We'll enjoy a couple of beers,and then we can
get you on your way.Jonas.This happened this morning.<i>Let's get out
of here. Blow the tanks!</i><i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i><i>It's not starting!
Whole system's down!</i><i>Mac, help!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i><i>DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i><i>Jonas was right.</i><i>Jonas was right!
Do you co...</i>It's Lori.Your ex-wife
and her crew are trappedbelow 11,000 meters.I fear they may
have encounteredthe same species
you did down there.I have divers with less
experience willing to go.But I feel
I owe it to my crewto give this rescue
the best chance of success.Please.Lori,
hand me that hexa key.Thanks.Oh.Okay.Okay, if we can
short out the firewall,I can... I can probably
reboot the computers.Okay. Try it now.Auxiliary power's back.Heaters are online.There's no way that we'll
get the engine started,but we might be able
to get the ballast tanks back.What are you doing?
Taking notes?Letter to my wife.Just in case.Hey.We got this.Step by step.Come on. Give me
that fighting octopus.See?Works every time.No.- What?
- We gotta can the lights.Turn out the lights.<i>There was
something down there with us.</i><i>How can you be
sure if there were</i><i>no observation windows
on your craft?</i><i>'Cause whatever it was</i><i>caved in the entire starboard
side of a nuclear submarine.</i><i>That wasn't my imagination.</i><i>Is that why
you blew the hatch mid-rescue?</i><i>Hey, look, I brought 11 men
back safe and sound.</i><i>You left
eight more to die</i><i>because you panicked.</i><i>If I hadn't blown the hatch,</i><i>we all would have been
killed by that thing.</i><i>There was no thing.</i><i>There was no evidence
of anything.</i><i>Because
it was destroyed</i><i>in the explosion, Heller.</i><i>Look, there was no time left!
So I made the call!</i><i>And you left
our friends there to die</i><i>in an act of cowardice!</i>What do you think
happened down there?He lost it.And now we're
about to send himinto the exact same situation.Excuse me, Suyin.I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but we need you.It's an emergency.What's wrong, Jaxx?Now they're leaking oxygen.They've got a couple of hours.
Maybe more.- I'm going.
- No.Wait, what?I'll take one of the gliders,
grab the <i>Origin,</i>- and tow her up.
- Wait!If the <i>Origin's</i> ballast tanks
blow, you're gonna die, too.We have to try.Mummy?Meiying.Um...Uh...Communications check!Good to go.Suyin, you are go for launch.Richard Byrd.<i>Auto descent
sequence initiated.</i>- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi.- Sir, we've got a new problem.
- It's your daughter.She took a glider
to try and save them.Why did you let her go?Trust me,
I didn't let her do anything.I was sort of
under the impressionyou're supposed to try
to save peoplewho are dying
on the bottom of the ocean.Who's he?I'm the guy
who paid for all this.Uh-huh.You know, he looks heroic
and he walks fast,but he's kind of
got a negative attitude.What's the window?It'll be close.Who are you?I'm the one
that designed all this.So my life's in your hands?Pretty much. That a problem?Nah.You look like you mightactually know
what you're doing.<i>Dive control level.</i>Oh, I'm sorry.Mac, have Doctor Heller
meet us in the medical bay.Heller?Did I not mention that?You mother...He's in perfect shape.Just like the last time
you examined me.Suyin took a glider
15 minutes ago.She's planning
on taking the <i>Origin</i> back up.Take me to the sub.- We're not done here.
- Yeah, we are.Lori's running out of air,and we're in
international waters,which means legallyI can beat the ever-loving
shit out of youand get away with it.It's true.Legally, I mean.Good thing
he doesn't hold a grudge.Jonas, you do knowthat this sub is rated
for 12,000 meters, right?Like the one leaking
on the ocean floor?Ah. Good point.- We good?
- Yep.Once you strip back
the safetiesand go full manual,
like I know you're gonna do,the system's gonna
have problemstrying to keep up
with your pressure changes.Try not to blow
your ears out, brother.Thanks, mate.Hello, skipper.You must be the crazy guy.Now who called me that?My mom. Doctor Heller.Yeah, well, I'm not crazy.I've just seen things
no one else has.That's the definition
of crazy.Backup power. Backup power...So where are your parents?My mom's trying
to bring our friends backfrom the bottom of the ocean.My dad's with a Pilates
instructor in Taipei.Granddad says
Mom needs to move on,but Mom says
she needs some more timebecause she was
married to an a-hole.Sounds like
your mom's got a point.You know a lot.Eight-year-olds
hear everything.Mind if I give it a try?Bye.Hey, Crazy.Is my mom gonna die?I'll have <i>Captain Bubbles</i>
and your mom back in no time.I promise.Thank you, Emma.Evolution
<i>launch in T-minus 15 seconds.</i>- DJ?
- Yeah.Jaxx, we good?Doc?<i>Evolution,</i>we are go for dive.Fancy.<i>System go for descent.</i><i>System go for descent.</i>Hey, brother.
We're good to go.<i>System go for descent.</i><i>System go for descent.</i>Jonas.<i>System go for descent.</i>Evolution <i>successful launch.</i>Evolution <i>now passing</i>
<i>1,000 meters.</i><i>Caution.</i> Evolution
<i>secondary systems offline.</i>How is he descending so fast?Looks like he's diverted
all nonessential powerlike heat and life support
to the motors.He's gonna black out.His blood gases are dropping.Jonas.<i>Tell Heller
I'm not slowing down.</i><i>Suyin, be advised.</i>Evolution <i>is now en route.</i>Request you return
to <i>Mana One</i> immediately.<i>Negative.</i>He can give us
an escort on our way up.Tell her to get
out of the way, Mac.More people means more risk<i>and she's in
way over her head.</i>Jonas, you just
told her yourself.What?The little green button
on your intercom,that's for single channel
communication.Brilliant.<i>Entering thermocline.</i><i>Okay, Mac.</i><i>I am through.</i><i>Warning.</i><i>Pressure load
approaching 16,000 psi.</i><i>At this speed,</i><i>I'm gonna have to divert
power from the heaters</i><i>and shut down anything
that could ice over.</i><i>Call you from the other side.</i>You got Wi-Fi here?All right.Okay.Just... Just keep
pressure on that.Toshi, is it still out there?I can't tell.I can't see anything
right now.Oh.There it is.I've got visual
on the <i>Origin.</i><i>I can see most of it.</i>Okay. They're alive.I'm going to set up to tow.<i>Range to target. Six meters.</i><i>Four meters.</i><i>Target locked.</i>Firing magnetic hook.Three. Two.Suyin? Are you okay?
What's happening?<i>There is something
down here.</i><i>Something just hit my ship.</i><i>Suyin, what's happening?</i>It's a huge squid.It's got the glider.<i>Warning.
Capsule pressure.</i><i>Mac, it's crushing me.
It's crushing me!</i><i>I don't think
the glider can take it.</i>It's not gonna hold.<i>Suyin, engage
the pressure compensator.</i><i>Compensator
will not engage.</i><i>Capsule breach in ten seconds.</i><i>Capsule breach in five sec...</i>My God!It's a shark.<i>It's like 20, 25 meters.</i>It's a megalodon.<i>Impossible.</i><i>I'm so glad I'm not crazy.</i>Suyin, power down.It's drawn to the light.Shut everything down
and stay dark.<i>Shutdown in 30 seconds.</i><i>Shutting off
everything but comms.</i><i>It's circling back.</i><i>Here it comes, Suyin.</i><i>Shutdown in 25 seconds.</i><i>Suyin, there's no time.</i>Turn off your lights.<i>Shutdown in 20 seconds.</i><i>Turn them off. Now.</i><i>Shutdown in 15 seconds.</i><i>Mac, I have no control.</i><i>Hurry.</i><i>Ten, nine,</i><i>eight, seven,</i><i>six, five...</i>Now's your chance.
Blow your tanks.No. I can help you
save the crew.<i>Your glider's damaged.
There's nothing you can do.</i>Blow your tanks now.Damn it.<i>Doctor Zhang,</i><i>your daughter's clear.</i><i>I'm heading</i>
<i>for the</i> Origin <i>now.</i><i>Range to target: three meters.</i><i>Water extraction complete.</i>Let's do this, sweetheart.Tell me this isn't the world's
best "I told you so."You came all the way herejust to tell me that,
didn't you?Pretty much.Give me your hand.Ah, that doesn't look good.
Ready? One, two, three.She's coming.Let's move.If that thing hits us
while we're still attached...Then we're all gonna die.Come on, I've got you.It's gonna be close.Come on, move, move!Go! Go! Go!We're not
gonna make it.- Come on.
- Toshi, hurry!Toshi, no!<i>Come in,</i> Evolution.<i>Jonas, come in.</i><i>Are you all okay?</i><i>Doctor Heller has vitals
on Lori and The Wall,</i><i>but we don't have Toshi.</i><i>Is Toshi okay?</i><i>Jonas, is Toshi okay?</i>- All right.
- Nice and easy.Yeah. Yep.- Don't move her neck.
- Careful.That's good.
Grab a hold. We got her.You couldn't bring
Toshi back?- Why not?
- He closed the hatch.He saved us.You left him.You left him
because that's who you are.You are the guy
who leaves people behind.You go that deep,you take your life
in your hands.It was your choice
to send them down.This is why
I don't do this anymore, Mac.How is she?Well, the puncture
just missed her liver.She lost a lot of blood.But she's stable.Jonas.I'm sorry.I was wrong.You save Lori,we can call it even.I just want to apologize
for before.I was angry
and I lose my temper.And you did save my...You're naked.I know you did all you could.
So, thank you.Yeah.You're welcome.I know it's not easy
being the person who survives.I'm gonna go now.You should
put on some clothes.Yep. That's the original plan.Okay, then. Carry on.Hi. Uh... I was...It's all good.Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know?Uh-huh.Whole experiment
was over in a year.I didn't ask anything.I know.This is what
attacked us. A megalodon.How big is that thing?Between 70 and 90 feet.
21 to 27 meters.The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed.It feared nothing.It had no predators.Its jaws were stronger
than any other animal, ever.The meg could bite
a whale in half,crushing through the bones.We are
in uncharted territory.Until todaymegalodons were thought
to have been extinctfor over two million years.- Wrong.
- A living fossil.That living fossil
ate my friend.I cannot begin
to expressmy sadness for Toshi's death.We have the discovery
of a lifetime.This is what Toshi worked for.It's what
we've all worked for.But we're going
to have to proceed slowly.Yeah, that's really
not gonna work for me.What is <i>Mana One?</i>This station?Yes. And what's it doing?Hmm? Right now.Exactly.Nothing.20 million dollar rover, gone.Thirty million dollar sub,
gone.You are now sitting
in the most expensiveunderwater marine
biology day campin human history.Hey, Crazy.And now that
we've actuallyfound something amazing,we can't proceed slowly.Thank you
for keeping your promise.- You're welcome.
- You don't quittrying to get to the Moon
because you lose an astronaut.You charge forward,or someone else
will get there first.Other people will want
a piece of this thing,whether we like it or not.You seem to like it.- Excuse me?
- I said, you seem to like it.I'm sorry.
Is he part of this team?You're damn right
he's a part of this team.Okay.You ever think
that Mother Naturemight know what she's doing?The thermocline might
just be there for a reason?Hey, look, you wanna explore?
Go ahead, explore.But if you start sending
people back down there,don't call me
to come save your asses.Because in case what happened
down therewasn't clear to you,man vs. meg isn't a fight.It's a slaughter.<i>O-Level.</i>What you people discovered
is an even bigger goldminethan we ever thought
possible.We are completely unpreparedto deal with creatures
like megalodon.I understand,
and we can get prepared.I'm talking about
a long-term plan.That's gonna be
the other alternative.What's that?My daughter.Jonas.- Did you see Meiying?
- We can't find Meiying.Meiying? Meiying?- I'll take this way.
- Let's try this way.Meiying.Meiying?- Meiying.
- Mama.Are you okay?There's a monster
and it's watching us.It's okay.
It's just a whale.Wait. Where's Lucy?Where's the mom?Is the station all right?
Report.No leaks. No visible damage.All right, team.
Initiate emergency protocols.And nobody is to go
near the water.If you insist.Turn off
all the underwater lighting.Restrict the crew
to essential areas.You said it was impossible
for it to get up here.It should have been.You guys,
take a look at this.When the glider came up,
the thermocline was intact,so it was
one degree Celsius, right?Yeah.But a minute later,
when the <i>Evolution</i> came up,the temperature increased
by 25 degrees.A shark could come
right through there.20 sharks for that matter.When the meg hit the <i>Origin,</i>it slammed into
a thermal vent.Those can release millions
of gallons per minute.The heat from that vent
cleared the paththrough the freezing
cold layer.Are you saying we opened upa super highway
for giant sharks?Not exactly. It seems like
it was a transitory event.The temperatures
are returned to normaland the gap is closed.Yeah. But not before a massive
prehistoric killing machinedecided to come up
and say "Hi."Hey, look, we're wasting time.
That thing's out there.We need to find it
and kill it.No.We can't. We should explore
non-lethal options first.For the meg or for us?<i>Attention.</i>I've got
an emergency locator beacon.20 miles south, southwest.What does that mean?It means
a boat has gone down.- <i>Attention.</i>
- Three boats.That's the meg.
We need to get there. Now.Mac! I found something!These sharks have no fins.They were killed
by shark poachers.They cut off the fins and
throw the shark back to die.All for a bowl of soup.Looks like the meg
evened the score.One fish did all this?Ask it yourself.Okay.We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board.If we can shoot the megin a soft spot
like it's mouth or gills,we can inject it
with something lethal.Whoa! Whoa, whoa.It's gonna take at least
20 minutes to rig the cage.And that thing
will be gone in two.Why don't you just
put a tracker on it?Don't you guys
ever watch <i>Shark Week?</i>You have one of those, like,
GPS tracker tag thingamajigs.Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready.We should be able
to put a tracking dartin that dorsal fin.You're welcome.Yeah, but somehowwe have to get this boat
next to that meg.No, we can't.It's already proven
aggressive towards boats.The safest way to approach
is without a vehicle.Hold up. Hold up.You want someone
to swim out there?To a prehistoric shark
that ate our friend?Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat.Okay, who the hell
is gonna make that swim?Let's draw straws.I can't swim.Uh...Sorry, my body
made me say that.You sure about this?Not really.If I get eaten,
you're gonna feel really bad.This tracker rifle
only has a 100-foot range.100 feet?Get really close
before you shoot.Great.If you want me
to go instead, I will.I got this, Mac.Okay, good,
'cause I was lying.Be safe.Yeah, thanks, pal.I hope you're right
about this.Me, too.I'm an idiot.I am proceeding to
the enormous killer shark.Yeah, we got you, Jonas.<i>Sharks are
attracted to panic motion.</i><i>Keep it nice and smooth.</i>It's all gonna be fine.<i>âª Just keep swimming</i><i>âª Just keep swimming</i><i>âª Swimming, swimming</i><i>âª Just keep swimming</i>Oh, boy,
it's going under.He's done it.Mac, tracker is live!Great!
Reel him in, DJ.Stop! Stop!No vibration!Oh, shit. I'm in trouble.Jonas, it's coming at you.You think I didn't notice?Start the boat!
Start the boat!Pull him in.- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!You might be
a son of a bitch,but you're sure as hell
no coward.Good job.I prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine.A killer whale is knocked
out with 10 CCs.Dead with 20.
What do you think?I think we use
the whole damn bottle.Remind me again
why this is a good idea.What?
It's a shark cage.Plastic shark cage.I'm gonna ignore
that you just said that.This beautiful thing
is polycarbonate,specifically designed
not to crack,not to break, but to deform.And in this case,
at this thickness,it would take 20,000 pounds
per square inch.And if you're talking
about breaking,that's eight to nine
hundred thousand.I don't like it.Doesn't like it.I wouldn't get in there.Keep it coming.That's good!Hey.What did he say?He said, "be careful."That's his version
of I love you.Your father has
a lot of faith in you.I've done
hundreds of shark dives.Not like this.Yes.But I know shark anatomy.And I know where thiscan penetrate through
megalodon skin.- Suyin, let me go instead...
- Hey.Don't worry about me.
Let me do what I do best.<i>Everything okay up there?</i><i>Just a fresh
round of chum,</i>so you,
you know, taste good.<i>I'm so glad
you're looking out for me.</i>Thank you.
Bye-bye. Good luck.<i>What's happening
down there?</i><i>You okay?</i><i>Yeah. I'm okay.</i><i>Just some teeny,
tiny eight-foot sharks.</i><i>Here we go.</i>We've got her attention.Suyin, it's on its way.- 50 meters.

The poison is in.</i><i>Okay, Suyin,

I'm in its mouth!</i>That cage will not break.<i>That's the problem.
The cage is being swallowed.</i>Hell, yeah!- Not this again.
- Oh, man. Oh, man.<i>New problem. My mask
is broken. I'm losing air.</i>Help!Help!Come on, Jaxx!- Thank you.
- You're welcome.<i>No, Jonas.</i><i>Go! Get back to the ship.</i><i>It's not safe for you.</i><i>Jonas, go back.</i><i>Jonas.</i><i>Jonas,

to the bottom. Hurry!</i>Swing the second crane over.We're gonna set a trap.
Guys, I need some bait.Come on. Got him!Whoa!Over here!This way. Throw a rope.She's not breathing.Whoa, whoa, whoa!Take it easy.You were dead a minute ago.Doctor.You got me out.It was closer
than I woulda liked.Can I have

you might wanna see.Wow.Wow.- Hey! Look who's up.
- Hey.- How are ya?
- I'm better. Thank you.Jonas, get a picture of mewith this big smelly beast.Okay. Wait. Here.Hey, you want

it's funny.Look. Watch this.<i>âª We got The Wall
in the water</i><i>âª We got The Wall
in the water âª</i><i>âª We got The Wall
in the water âª</i>Hey, Suyin.Look at him next to the meg.Look, remember the bite marks
on the O-Level?Well, how do you like that?That was a serious
man vs. nature moment.I'm just glad
things went our way.It didn't go our way.Not for Toshi.And not for science.We did what people always do.Discover and then destroy.Ugh.Hey, I will end you.At least you can use this
as your dating app pic.Give you a little leg,
you know.Yeah!Oh, yeah!- Jellyfish.
- Whoo-hoo!Two! There's two?Nobody said there were two.How are there two?Help me!
Get me out of this water!Help! Somebody help, please!Help!What is wrong with you?I can't... I can't swim.No! Get outta here! Really?Don't pull that
racist stuff on me.Oh, come on, man.Give me a break.
I'm not being racist.You work, literally,
in the middle of the ocean.This wasn't
part of the job description.None of this was part
of the job description!They left that part out!It's time
to get some real help.Yeah. Go get some help.I'm quitting.Mac! Give me a hand.Hey, I need you
to find my location.Track my sat phone.
There's a second shark.Yes, two.How the hell should I know?Just hurry up
and get us some help.Thank you, Jonas. Thank you.Bring whatever
you got!Just relax. Relax.It's not good.He needs a hospital fast.Let's get the doctor.
Where's Doctor Heller?Jaxx?Jaxx, you okay?Yeah! Kind of.Jaxx...We can do this.Swim gently back to the boat.Nice and easy.Here it comes!Heller!We're not gonna make it.Jaxx.You're gonna be okay.- You're a good person, Jaxx.
- Wait, what?Don't look back.- Hey!
- No!Heller, no!- What are you doing?
- Hey!Hey, come on!Hey! Hey, come on!Hey!Heller!Almost there.- Come on.
- We got you.It's okay, Jaxx.You're gonna be okay.Thank you, Heller, thank you.What was that?
What the hell was that?- Okay, come on, DJ.
- No! No!This is why we don't
leave the station, okay?That's why you don't do that!And you went down there
and you pissed it off,now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!Now what are we
supposed to do?I shouldn't even be out here
in the first place.Swimming in this ocean.
That one ate the other one.Is another one
gonna eat this one?Man, it's...It just killed Heller.It killed The Wall.
It killed Toshi.These are my friends, man.Okay,
can I just point outthat this thing is sinking?What are we gonna do now?Where's Mac?Yes!What happened to your hair?What happened to your hair?Touche.Guys!That thing is the devil.10 miles, it's still with us.You got us?The ocean. The middle
of a freaking ocean!Do you think
it'd slow down the sharkif we threw him over?You got to work on yourself.Okay. Good news, guys.It's payback time.Oh, yeah!Yes! Get some!You seriously think
that a rifleis gonna hurt that thing?I didn't have
much notice, okay?I just wanted to get it
off our backs.Well done, Morris.Whoo!It's okay.Mummy! Mummy!Welcome back, Mummy.Come in.How's Meiying?She's sad.And confused.How are you?I really don't want
to accept it.Sometimes things happen
that change your life forever.Meanwhile,
the world just keeps going.You think maybe it would stop
just for a second...But it doesn't.How do you live with it?I don't.I left my two best friends
to die.I think about it
all the time.Every day I replay it.Could I have done more?It's not just about
the ones you lose.It's also about
the ones you save.I'm glad you're here.I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg.As well as the authorities
in Thailand,Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Australia.The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out.So, this is now officiallyand thankfully
out of our hands.I'm closing <i>Mana One</i>until the meg is killedand an evacuation ship is
coming here tomorrow morning.You damn right.And finally,
I just want to sayI'm sorry for your losses.Your friends.I came here
to celebrate with you,and now I'm mourning with you.Thanks for saving our asses.What do you got for me?These are Semtex high velocity
demolition charges.I had the men rig delay fuses
to give them time to sink.Essentially,
they're depth charges.That's right.I'm not sure this is
a advisable course of action.Every person that gets maimed
or killed by that thingis a potential lawsuit.A potential casualty.Relax, bro.
It's gonna be fun.- I can see your cards.
- Well, look at you two crooks.Hey.How are you feeling?Like I got off easy,compared to
the rest of you guys.Mmm.What do you got up there?Three kings.What? Come on! Every time.You owe me
a soda for that one.Fine.We'll square up
when you get back, okay?Fine. Fine. Fine.Just trying to take her mind
off things, you know.She's tougher than me,
that's for sure.I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.Well, you didn't
call me crazy.Yeah, but I didn't
call you sane.Yeah, well, "sane" wasn't
a word I heard very often.So, what now?I don't know.
Go back to Thailand, I guess.Mac told me
about you and Suyin.- Nothing to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be.You and Mac are unbelievable.How about you just
try something new?So the rest of your life
isn't a vast wastelandof misery and solitude.I think that's a good idea.You do, huh?Eight-year-olds
hear everything.Jonas...My mom likes you, too.This is possibly
the worst moment of my life.<i>Approaching target area.</i><i>I'll confirm visual.</i>Let me make myself
absolutely clear.We are not getting within
a mile of that monsteruntil the helicopter kills it.<i>We have a visual
on the target.</i>Stop the boat.Stop the boat.<i>Deploying
depth charges.</i>We got him.Hit it again.<i>Sir,
there's no way possible...</i>Hit it again.<i>Target is dead.
Repeat, target is dead.</i>Are you absolutely sure?Because I'm not getting eatenby some goddamn
prehistoric fish.<i>Affirmative, sir.
There's, uh...</i>Well, there's pieces of it
all over the place.<i>Shark chunks?</i>That's a good sign.All right. Take us in.Oh!Jump down there,
get me a couple of teeth.Big ones for my desk.- All right.
- Keep one for yourself.Nice.Oh, you seeing this?Crazy.That's sick.That's weird.Oh, man!
Don't do that to me.That thing
doesn't have any teeth.What?I think we killed a whale.It's right below us.Get us outta here!Wait! Wait,
you idiots! Wait!I'm over here! Wait!Oh, no!Oh!Yeah, I understand.
I understand, yep. Thank you.Let me guess,
Morris never called anyone.Didn't call anyone.No one knows
the shark's out there.No one. Not the Australians,not the Chinese. No one.The hell was he thinking?He wanted to make this go away
as quietly as possible.Mac, we need
to let everyone...Let everyone know.
Yeah, I'm on it.Jaxx, can you find that thing?Wait, wait, wait.
Why're you asking her that?I don't like the fact that you
asking her about that thing.You want me
to illegally hackinto Morris' satellite
tracking system- to find a prehistoric shark?
- Yeah.Okay.We use a tracker,
find the meg, and we kill it.Bro.We really gonna do this?A lot of people are gonna die
if we don't, Mac.- Well, I'm in.
- Me, too.Let's do this.How do you feel about
commandeering that evac ship?I'd say,it's a great day
to go fishing.Now let's get
everything on it.Construction explosives,
gliders.The whole lot. Everything.Because we're about
to evac, right?Like evacuate?Like, leave the area
of imminent dangerand go to a safe place
like normal people?What we got, Jaxx?
Anything?Yeah. Here's where we saw
Morris attack the shark.But here is where it's going.Sanya Bay. What's there?Oh, nothing.It only has some of the mostdensely populated beaches
in the world.Any luck with the authorities?No."Prehistoric shark" sounds
like a damn prank call.We can't rely on them
for anything.How long until the
shark gets to those people?20 minutes.- Can we get there first?
- Doubtful.Yeah, we're gonna have to.Getting there first
won't mean anythingif we don't have a plan.Maybe we have a plan.Here's where we do it.
Right here in the shallows.Use the gliders
and go after it.Okay, so, how are we
gonna get it here,when there's a beach full
of people to eat right here?You ask it out for dinner.So...
How do you wanna do this?Is that you asking my opinion?No.I was just being politebefore telling you
what we're actually doing,so you feel
better about yourself.Appreciate that.What?Nothing.We're ready.Pippin!Oh, my God!We're close enough.
Stop here.Jaxx, DJ, we gotta get
that thing in the water.Yeah, we're on it.Shark! Shark!<i>Any last
thoughts about our plan?</i>Not dying
would be a good start.Finally,
we agree on something.<i>Let's not make it a habit.</i><i>Suyin, look out!
Get out of there!</i>- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship.Jesus!<i>Jonas, it's on you.</i>Mac!Jonas, what's going on
down there?Trying to stay
out of its mouth.Jeez!Oops.<i>Suyin, are you set?
I'm coming to you.</i>I'm in position.<i>Shark's getting close.</i>I need a little
breathing room.- I'm ready to fire.
- <i>Take the shot.</i><i>Move! Move!</i>Anybody see it?<i>Can't see the shark, but
something's going on up here.</i><i>Okay,
I've got her attention.</i>Bring her to me.Here we come.Make your move, Suyin.Chew on this,
you ugly bastard.No, no, no! Shit!Jeez!No, no, no. Go! Go! Go!- Where's DJ?
- I don't know.- Where's Meiying?
- I don't know!- <i>I couldn't see her anywhere.</i>
- Jonas.- <i>Sorry, I...</i>
- Go, go. Take care of Meiying.Jonas!<i>I'm okay. I'm leading
it away from the ship.</i>- Oh, my God! Gotta get...
- Stop splashing!You have a life jacket on!- A life jacket?
- Yep.Oh, yeah.
I've got a life jacket on.It's right here. I can...The monster's here.The monster's here?No, don't worry
about the monster, I got you.- Everything's fine.
- Stop talking.Meiying!Mummy! It's you!That's good! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me.Wait for DJ,
wait for DJ. Yeah.- Yes.
- Come on.Mummy, are you okay?I'm okay.I'm okay, too.Come on. Come up!- Meiying, be careful.
- Jonas!Careful! Careful!- There it is.
- Oh, my God.Jonas!It's coming.We're sitting ducks
up here, Jonas.- <i>Mummy!</i>
- <i>It's coming.</i>- <i>Can you hear me, Jonas?</i>
- <i>Meiying, hold on.</i><i>Suyin, we're gonna
have to go. Through here.</i>Jonas, we've got nothing left.Almost nothing.How're you gonna kill it?<i>Evolution.</i>I'm gonna
make this thing bleed.<i>Suyin, what you said before,
you were right.</i>It's not about
the people you lose.<i>It's about the people
you save.</i>- Signing off.
- <i>Jonas!</i>Here we go.How do you like that? Bleed!Come on, come on, come on.Come on.Hey!Hey!Yes!Thank you.Beep-beep!
Coming through, Crazy.- Hi.
- Look who it is.Well,here's to being alive.And to our friends.Cheers!I don't know about you.But, uh,
I could use a vacation.Shall we ask my mum?Subtitles by explosiveskull

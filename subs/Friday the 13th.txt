Come here. Come here now.You're the last one.I've killed all the others.It'll be easier for you
than it was for Jason.Why are you doing this?You need to be punished
for what you did to him.- I didn't do anything.
- You let him drown.- Jason was my son.
- I didn't do anything.No. No. No. Please.You should have been watching him.Every minute.Jason.My special, special boy.They must be punished, Jason,
for what they did to you.For what they did to me.Kill for Mother.WADE: I'm serious.You gotta watch out for
mountain lions. They're all over.- RICHIE: Mountain lions?
- WADE: We'll be fine. They're afraid of fire.RICHIE: Dude, shut the
fuck up. I'm calling bullshit.MIKE: Richie's gonna call bullshit.- RICHIE: Bullshit!
- WADE: Richie's calling bullshit.- I'm not bullshitting.
- RICHIE: Bullshit.You'll see when a mountain
lion comes out...- MIKE: Dude, there's one right there!
- Nice try.(LAUGHING)I am more afraid to be
eaten by mosquitoes.Hey, you wanna slap that ass
one more time for Daddy?- Did Daddy like that?
- Yeah, Daddy does like it. A lot.Whitney? Where are you right now?- I'm here.
- Are you?I'm here. Right in the
middle of nowhere.- RICHIE: Hey, are you reading that right?
- WADE: I'm reading it right.- MIKE: Come on, Pizarro, let's go.
- Where are we going?- MIKE: These are heavy and it's hot.
- RICHIE: Where are we?Dude, we are way the fuck off.- No, we're not, act...
- Yes.No, we're not. Not everything
shows up on GPS, Richie.A sign said there was a mine
here. Did that come up?No. We're close, I think.You think? Dude, you don't
know how to use this thing.It's almost dark. Do
you know where it is?Look, I didn't plant
this shit, Richie, okay?I got this tip from a secondhand
source. We should be close.Look, we're gonna stop here.Tomorrow morning, you and me, we get
up at dawn. We go, we find the crop.We cut down as much as we can.
We ditch it in the truck.- Back here before breakfast, okay?
- Hey.- Guys. Guys.
- Nobody knows a thing.There's a perfect spot here.
It's already been cleared.Perfect. We'll camp here.Hey. Do you know how much money
we're gonna make selling this weed?- A lot of fucking money.
- Yeah, okay? So listen to me. Relax.- I am. You wanna know why?
- Why?- You know what rich people do?
- What?They relax. You need
to fucking relax.- RICHIE: I need to relax?
- WADE: You need to relax.Hey, guys. Guys.I just found some broken-down cabins
over there. It's gotta be the old camp.Who wants to go check it out?Is this all we brought
to drink? No Heineken?Fuck that Euro shit.This is Pabst Blue American
Ribbon, my friend.You do realize this camp was
closed down, like, 20 years ago?Some woman, she went fucking nuts.Killed all these counselors.Blamed them for her son's
drowning. He was like...deformed or retarded or something.Really?Mom got hers.Apparently there was one survivor.This girl...she cut that lady's head
off with a machete.It gets weirder.I'm sure it does.Her son, Jason...he came back.He was actually there.He watched his mom being beheaded.A friend of mine, he went
to camp around here...- RICHIE: Oh, jeez.
- He went to camp around here.He said the cops came. They were
looking for that Jason guy.All right, you know what?- Don't believe me.
- RICHIE: Nobody does.WADE: But I'm pretty sure,
the way the story goes...the place was called
Camp Crystal Lake.Do you know how many lakes are
probably called Crystal Lake?It's like Crystal Geyser, Crystal
Water. Go to a supermarket.Every single bottle of water
is "Crystal" something.- Aquafina.
- The...- Okay, fine.
- Okay.The story could have happened anywhere.
It's how they get kids to shit themselves.- How's that beer, beer-snob?
- Better than my own piss.You can drink that, by the way. Yours,
hers, mine. I swear, piss is sterile.- You will never drink my piss.
- That's what you think.What about me?- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mm-hm.I got marshmallow on my knee.- Where you guys going?
- Go make out.Oh, yeah?- Hey, Mikey?
- Sweet.Wear a condom.An extra small one.I get it, dude. You do what
you gotta do to survive.If we were all out here starving
to death and you were dead...I'd eat your leg.- That's really sweet. Yeah.
- Thank you.Why would you eat my leg, man? I can
teach you how to fish. Just go fishing.I don't eat fish.That's not what you told me.(LAUGHING)WHITNEY: Listen...I don't think I'm gonna
stay the whole time.Did Wade's story scare you?(CHUCKLES)Please.I just...I don't feel right being here...so far away from my mom.Your mom was the one that told me to
get you out of town for a few days.- Really?
- Yeah.And she's in good hands. She's
got her nurse right there.Come on.Have sex with your boyfriend
in a cramped little tent.We can get hammered, blow
some chunks in the woods.Then we can go back Monday
and deal with whatever.Hey.I'm a fucking idiot.Richie?- The ephemeris data just didn't sync up.
- Oh, dude, that sucks.WADE: Fucking right.- Do you know what this means?
- (MOUTHS) I wanna...What?We're, like... We're,
like, a half mile away.- Less.
- Shut up.WADE: You know what makes me happy,
Richie? Global positioning systems.GPS to the layperson.NASA technology...in the palm of your hand. Know
what this little fucker does?This guy sends a signal
up into outer space.(RICHIE MOUTHING)Signal.Satellite gets it, turns it around.It's like, "Oh, thank you, GPS.
I'm gonna send a signal to you."Back to the palm of your hand.
Technology, man.It is un-fucking-believable.Wade, you gotta bounce, dude.
Tell your dumb shit to somebody else.Why, because I'm fucking
teaching you something?Say, Richie, old buddy,
I'm gonna bounce.- RICHIE: You do that, brother. Okay.
- I'm spent.May the Force be
with your Schwartz.RICHIE: You're in so much trouble.(LAUGHING AND SCREAMING)(NIGHT RANGER'S "SISTER CHRISTIAN"
PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES)(SINGING "SISTER CHRISTIAN")(UNZIPS FLY)Oh.(URINATING)(ZIPS FLY)Fuck, yes.(MOANS)I love you.And you. And you.I even love you.Oh, my God. Look at this shit.What the fuck? What the fuck?!What's this? No, no! No! No!(METAL SLICING)MIKE: That must be the camp
that Wade was talking about.- Let's check it out.
- No, I wanna go this way.Come on.Come on.Wow, look at that.Mike, where are you going?- MIKE: Let's go inside.
- No.- Where's your sense of adventure?
- Oh, come on.MIKE:
Come on. What are you scared of?WHITNEY: No.I am willing to bet there's
some pretty cool shit in here.Mike, don't go in there. What if
some homeless person lives here?MIKE:
No homeless person lives here.(MIKE SHUDDERS)You hungry?Wow.Look at how old this shit is.It's like it was dragged
here from another century.Check this out.Hey. It looks like you.- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, it does.It's cool, you should keep it.It's a little kid's room.Wasn't Jason the name
from Wade's story?- I wanna go.
- What?- Like, right now.
- Oh, come on.Please?- RICHIE: You like that?
- Yeah. Wait for me. Wait for me.- No, I think I'm gonna...
- Oh, no. Don't do that again.(TWIGS CRACKING)- RICHIE: We'll do it at the same time.
- Hang on.- I'm almost there.
- Shit. I heard something.Stop it. Wait, I'm serious.- What?
- I think Wade's watching us.What?Well, fuck it, let the perv watch.Right?Shit.Wade.Dude, if you're out there whacking
off, man, that is not cool.Come on, dude.I think we're good.- AMANDA: Don't come yet.
- RICHIE: No, no.- Tell me when you want to.
- AMANDA: Wait.RICHIE: Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.(MOANING)(TWIGS CRACKING)Shit. Fuck. Shit.Okay.Wade!I'm gonna kill you.Okay?- Okay?
- Okay.No, go get him. Tell
him to leave us alone.I'm not gonna go out
there with a boner.Well, you're not getting
any until you do.- Go.
- Do not move, okay?Richie?(CRACKS)Richie, stop fucking around.(RUSTLES)Wade.Dude, you jump out from a tree, I'm gonna
punch you in your face, I shit you not.Come on, man. I gotta get
back to the fucking tent.Holy shit.You fucking jerk,
you found the weed.(CHUCKLES)Wade. Wade!(SCREAMING)Wade. Wade.(AMANDA SCREAMING)Amanda!(SCREAMING)Amanda! Goddamn!AMANDA: Richie!Fuck!Richie!Oh, God!MIKE: Cool.Whitney, you've gotta see this.Mike. Come on.No, I'm serious. You've gotta
see this. Somebody's been here.What is that?There's something in there.- Looks like some kind of a doll.
- Are you crazy?- MIKE: Oh, my God! Ah!
- Ah!(DOOR SLAMS)There's something out there.- Stay here.
- No.Ah! Oh, my God!(WHITNEY SCREAMING)MIKE: Get away, get back!Get off the floor!Holy fuck!- Ah!

- Go!Help me!- Mike! Mike!
- Run.Run! Run, Whitney!Oh, my God.Oh, God.Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Whitney! Whitney, help.
Whitney, please. Help!Whitney! Whitney.Whitney!(RICHIE SCREAMING)Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Shit.Come on. Shit.Oh, God. No. Come on.(WHITNEY SCREAMING)Oh, my God. Babies have
more space in the uterus.Hey, Lawrence, how
about a little help?Dude, you're gonna ask the one black
guy to pump the gas for you? Shit.Okay. Nolan.How about I pay, you pump?Sure, man. Hey, I give
a wicked blow job too.Okay, well, um, we'll
try that out later.(HORN BEEPS)Whoa. Hey, bro, that's... I have a
heart murmur. What are you doing?- CLAY: Thank you.
- MAN: Where'd you get a knapsack like that?It was a present, actually.
But I'm looking for my sister.She's gone missing, about
a month and a half ago.My parent's cabin is stocked. You
think you're actually gonna get laid?Your parents do not
have Combos or Funyuns.They definitely don't
have Fritos. And this is...not for sex.- What are you gonna use them for?
- It's an experiment.Okay. So just get behind me. I'm
not gonna pay for that shit.Would you mind if I maybe just put a
flyer in the window or something?Oh, I heard about that. That's sad.If it was up to me, you could wallpaper
the whole place with them...but the owner makes the rules.And he's a real:(FARTS)Um...Well, is he here? Maybe I could talk to him.
Maybe if he understands the situation...TRENT: Are you gonna buy something?I mean, you've been up here for
quite a while yapping, So...Sure. Yeah.Thanks. So we have two
waters and some gas.Two waters and some gas.Guess I'm an asshole.You okay, bro? Is everything good?CLAY:
Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks.But I'm not your bro.So you don't wanna be friends?
You don't wanna hang out?- JENNA: Let it go, Trent.
- It's not me. This guy's being a dick.Yeah, it's me. Obviously,
I'm the one being a dick.Sir, thank you very much anyways.- MAN: Yep.
- I'm sorry.Thank you.(BUMBLEBEEZ'S "FREAK YA
LONELINESS" PLAYING ON STEREO)Seat belts.(SIREN WAILS)Welcome back, Clay.You mean that, Officer Bracke?Son, I know you think
we're not on your side...that we're just a bunch of
dumb country hicks out here.I put two 10-year
veterans on that case.We did three dozen interviews and ran
a county-wide search for your sister.You know how many thousands of
people disappear every year...even in this state alone?But there's no evidence that
anything happened to Whitney...or any of those other kids at Crystal
Lake. There's no car, no witnesses.Nothing.One of those kids was
her boyfriend, right?Right.Well...they probably just
took off together.Our mother just died of cancer.
Did I tell you that?- No, sir.
- Well, she did.She was sick for a long time...and Whitney took care of
her every single day.And then my sister didn't
show up for the funeral.See, you just don't know my
sister. That's not possible.Well...she's not here, son.Might wanna try looking someplace else.
That's what the other families are doing.- CHEWIE: Can you say that with a...?
- Wow.CHEWIE: Can you say that
with a little more hatred?- LAWRENCE: Nice.
- Shit.CHEWIE: Sir Lancelot, thank you.- NOLAN: Oh, man down.
- Take it easy, guys.Is anyone getting a
signal out here?Are you fucking with me? I got
business I gotta do this weekend.What business?Music. I'm trying to start a label.Oh, yeah? Like what kind? Like rap?Why you gotta go racial?Look, don't put me
in a box, all right?What, because I'm black I
can't listen to Green Day?You're right, that was dumb.
So, what kind of music?Rap.TRENT: Here it is.- CHEWIE: Oh, my God.
- Yep.All right, we have two bedrooms
upstairs. We've got one down.Someone can take the couch.
It's comfy as hell.- CHELSEA: Wow.
- TRENT: Nice, huh?- LAWRENCE: Damn.
- CHEWIE: That is a fierce pussy.It's a bobcat. It's
my dad's first kill.I didn't think this long-ass car
ride was gonna be worth it...but it's kind of worth it.LAWRENCE:
This is bigger than the dorm.What can I say? Hey, take your
feet off the table, please.So make yourselves at home.(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)- What do you wanna do first?
- TRENT: What do you wanna do?Oh, well...I brought Sweet Lucille. I think
you all need to meet her.Lucille? Baby, is that you?- Lawrence, you've been cheating.
- No.- I saw you with a bowl the other night.
- No, you...CHEWIE: A bowl.CLAY: Hello?Hello?Hello?Hello?(DOG BARKING)Christ.- I just wanted to ask you a question.
- Hush.I wanted to ask you if maybe
you've seen somebody.My sister.She came camping up around
here with some friends...and she's gone missing.She ain't missing. She's dead.- What?
- People go missing around here...they're gone for good.Outsiders come, they don't
know where to walk.They bring trouble.We just wanna be left alone.And so does he.So does who?Ma'am, please. So does who?(YELLING)(WOMEN CHANTING)- NOLAN: You, baby. It's all you.
- Stop peer-pressuring me.- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.- Yes!
- CHEWIE: My fucking eye!Guys, watch the floor, all right,
please? That's stained oak.- This is an outside game. Come on.
- CHEWIE: Wait, I got foam in my contact.JENNA: Hey. This is a great spot.Do you wanna go for a hike?
Get some exercise?That'd be nice, but, well, I can't
exactly leave them here alone.What are you talking about?Have you seen what
they're doing inside?Crazy. Some drunken hoodlums.- Hoodlums?
- Hoodlums.What do you think they're gonna do?- I mean, steal the deer head?
- You're right.How are they gonna pull off the getaway?
We're leaving in the same car.Come on. Do you want some exercise?Because I have this really great
move that I've been practicing...and I need someone
to practice it with.Very charming. Very charming.Oh, come on.- You wanna go on a hike?
- You like hikes now?- I love hikes.
- I knew it.Will you get me a beer?(MACHINERY BUZZING)Excuse me.Sir?- Hey!
- Oh, shit. Jesus.Sorry.Jesus Christ.You're fucking lucky
there, stretch.Came that close to hitting the start
button on the whoop-ass machine, boy.Look, I didn't mean to startle you.
I was trying to get your attention.This is Mr. Garikes' property.You're lucky that old mummy fart
didn't put buckshots in your ass.Somebody's been stealing
his fucking kerosene too.Look, I just came in here
to ask you something, okay?I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen her?She's been missing
for about a month.I wish I had, man.- I ain't seen her, though.
- Thanks.- Take care.
- You too.Shit. Hey, hey, hey.I forgot, did you
wanna buy some weed?Seriously, I found a fucking shit ton of
it growing out there. A little bushel.- Sell you some.
- No. Thanks.- You sure? I got a whole bunch of it.
- I'm good.DONNIE: You sure?It's your fucking loss, dude.It'll fuck your shit up, boy.Good times...fucker.JENNA: Just relax, okay?
These guys are your guests.If you're...If you're not comfortable having them
here, then why did you invite them?So they could admire your place?No. I just wanted to have
a good weekend. You know?Hey, guys. Wanna check out the
other side of the lake with us?Um... You know what?
It's getting, you know...No. That's okay. It's... It's okay.
It's getting kind of late.- Yeah.
- Okay.Take my truck.- Nice.
- I trust you.Can you do me a favor? Will you
take the gas cans to the boat?It's on the south end of the lake.
Just take a right onto Town Road.- Take a right.
- Okay, and then?Why don't you just type
"boat" into the nav?- Technology, right?
- See you.- Have fun.
- Later.Don't drive my boat.I'm the only one that
drives the boat, okay?Aye, aye, captain.Damn straight.(CHELSEA SCREAMS)What does that say about me
that the second Trent said..."Don't take my boat out," it
was guaranteed that I would.It means you're a sociopath.Now, what does it say about
me that I find that hot?(KNOCKING)Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm looking for my sister and...Hey.- No luck?
- No. No, not yet.- May I?
- Yeah.- Thank you.
- Sure.She's pretty.Thanks.Do you wanna come in for
a second, grab a drink?Uh...I don't think your boyfriend
would like that too much.Don't worry. He'll be fine.And here we have the stoned
American male, foraging for food.Thanks.This should be interesting.Hey, Trent, you remember...Clay.Yeah. Of course I remember Clay.Why is he in my house?Hey, new guy. Beer?No, no. He's gotta get going.
You got flyers to pass out, right?Yeah.Right.- Look, if you're hungry, we...
- Okay.Look, Clay, obviously she's
just trying to be nice.But you can't stay here. No offense,
but this is a private party.- I don't know you.
- No, you don't know me.That's so funny, I just said that.Like two seconds ago,
that I don't know you.I would probably leave soon before
I get pissed off and, you know...- Yeah?
- Yeah.What happens then?Hey, look. Take it easy, Trent, all right?
I'll just... I'll walk you out.Yeah.Jenna. Jenna, come on.
Where you going?JENNA: Sorry about that.That's all right. It's
his house, you know?Where's your car?I do not have a car,
but I do have her.- Nice.
- Thanks.- This thing runs?
- Yeah. Yeah, it runs.So where you off to next?I haven't been to the other side of the
lake, so I was gonna go check that out.- Do you want some company?
- I'd love some company.It's a big motherfucker, huh?Fuck, yeah.You hot bitch.Let Daddy have a little lick.You like that, bitch?
You know you do.(CREAKING)What the fuck was that?Somebody better not be stealing
the kerosene up there.(CLATTERING)Shit.Gina.It's just you, baby.It's been a long time, Gina.You remember that
special night we had?You remember when you
took my virginity?You're sexy.You're still tight as ever. I'm
gonna fucking pound you so hard.What the fuck?(GRUNTING)(TEARS)What the...?That shit ain't fucking right,
dude. What the fuck?You think we should take the
boat out? He's gonna find out.- I knew it.
- What?You're inhibited. You talk a big game, but
inside you're just a scared little girl.CHELSEA:
Oh, really? Oh, okay, fine.You wanna find out who's
really scared? Let's do it.NOLAN: All right. Let's go.JENNA: So you and your
sister must be pretty close.We were pretty close when we
were younger. We kind of drifted.I mean, I bailed when I was 17,
and she stayed with my mom.She kind of had to, I guess.I don't know, she's always
been the responsible one.So when's the last time
you talked to her?About six months ago. We
got in a fight, actually.She called and said she wanted to see
me, said she was counting on me...and I never showed.Excuse me.JENNA: What is that?CLAY: It's a GPS.- All right, you ready?
- Ready. Let's do it.(SCREAMS)Yeah. Oh, shit.Yeah.(YELLS)Yeah.LAWRENCE: Pick it, pick it.Oh, you like the balls
in your hand, huh?Which one? Which one is it?
Is that the one?- Those feel good, don't they?
- That's the one.Shoot.(YELLING)Fuck.One of you has gotta
shoot the boot.That's you, babe.- Are you serious?

carrying you the entire game.- CHEWIE: Come on, baby.

shoot the boot, shoot the boot.Shoot the boot.Fuck that. I'm not drinking out
of your sweaty-ass sneaker.You lost 10 in a row. Shoot.My house, my rules.
I'm not drinking that shit.- CHEWIE: Fine.

last cabin, then we'll head back.Come on.You really should call the police.CLAY: I've already called. They're
not looking for her anymore.No one is, except for me.Then they should look
harder because...Oh! Ow.- You all right?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.- CLAY: You sure?
- Yeah.CLAY: Let's get out of here.Watch your step.Give me a sec, I gotta
change out my batteries.(RUSTLING)- Someone's coming.

- Shh.- I gotta follow him.
- JENNA: He had a dead body.- We gotta go. We gotta warn my friends.

1
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,630
To the Bank of England! Quickly!

2
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:18,190
Surround the building!

3
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,871
You go that way! You go this way!

4
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:31,061
There he is!

5
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,118
- Come on!
- After him, men!

6
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:01,576
That way!

7
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:28,666
- He came this way. I'm sure of it.
- Come on!

8
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:31,157
Come on, mates! Keep up!

9
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:37,884
Sorry, sir.

10
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:03,444
Today is the day I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible.

11
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:07,507
Man can break
the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.

12
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:11,043
And you're lucky
to be a part of it, Pierre.

13
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,565
- It's Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.

14
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:17,247
We will make history.
Or we will die trying.

15
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,708
- Die?
- This is very exciting.

16
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:24,070
That's it!
I refuse to be catapulted,

17
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:28,336
electrocuted, or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

18
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,124
I quit!

19
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,998
He is a very sick man!

20
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:42,494
The electrocution was not my fault!

21
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,795
You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

22
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:47,942
We're looking for a bank robber.

23
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,139
Is there no man brave enough
to be my valet?

24
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:55,445
Oh... Aah!

25
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:00,754
I'm your new valet.

26
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:04,613
Uh... I must commend
the valet service

27
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,023
on their impeccable foresight.

28
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:10,286
But they know I only
accept French valets.

29
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,392
Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!

30
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:17,106
I come from a long line
of French valets.

31
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:19,883
On my father's side.
Very, very French.

32
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,410
- But your accent.
- My father French. Never speak.

33
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:29,492
My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.

34
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:32,968
Very well.

35
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:37,041
Will you be willing to risk your life
to challenge the laws of physics?

36
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:41,593
- Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent. Pop this little hat on.

37
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:44,790
- He's got to be in here.
- He's this way!

38
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:53,260
And the throttle in your
right hand controls the speed.

39
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:01,787
- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!

40
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:21,108
Uh-uh-uh...

41
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:26,508
Twenty-five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.

42
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,713
We need more speed, man.

43
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:33,273
Waah! Wee-yoo!

44
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:36,655
Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.

45
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,453
Forty-seven.

46
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:46,112
Forty-eight.

47
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,975
Forty-nine.

48
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:50,009
Eureka! We've done it!

49
00:05:58,632 --> 00:05:59,974
Uh...

50
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,050
Waaah!

51
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,557
I say, I say. Uh, good morning.

52
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:08,350
- I'm looking for a man with...
- Over here!

53
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,299
There he is. There's my valet.

54
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:15,850
Sorry! New valet.

55
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:28,462
Whoa!

56
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,378
Whoa!

57
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,700
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

58
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:39,610
You'll be able to let go any second.

59
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,334
The pack will run out of steam

60
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:45,729
in exactly three, two, one.

61
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,670
Now.

62
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,986
Look out!

63
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:56,035
- That was incredible!
- We've broken the human speed barrier.

64
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:59,125
Good-bye, sir.

65
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:02,173
It's been very nice valeting for you.

66
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:06,959
Let's... do it again soon.

67
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,475
Please, wait!

68
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,537
With you as my brave valet,
I can test all my inventions.

69
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:13,787
No!

70
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:15,761
Spread out!

71
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,185
- Cover that...
- Yes, yes.

72
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,027
- I take the job.
- Splendid!

73
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:22,450
I can't wait to present
my results to the Academy.

74
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:27,783
Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.

75
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:32,494
And with this grant to develop
new applications for copper wire,

76
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:35,957
Dr. Ramsey invented this.

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,553
Needless to say,
the Royal Academy of Science

78
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:46,478
declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent,

79
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:50,732
and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum.

80
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:55,830
Sir. I have an urgent
announcement for you. Here.

81
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:58,568
Don't just stand there. Read it.

82
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,693
Oh. Um...

83
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:04,334
"It is with great distress

84
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:07,143
that Scotland Yard announces

85
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,978
that the Bank of England...
has been robbed."

86
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:15,211
My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!

87
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:18,916
You gave me every assurance that
the Bank of England was impenetrable!

88
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,625
Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."

89
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,491
It's the same thing, you idiot!

90
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,733
Please, please, not the quills!

91
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,770
Lord Salisbury!

92
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:34,747
Please contact General Fang
and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.

93
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:38,696
To forgo your obligation would
be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.

94
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:42,379
A woman in the Royal Academy?

95
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:46,141
The Jade Buddha was delivered
by us to the Bank of England.

96
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,425
- What happens while in British hands...
- Is absolutely your concern.

97
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:53,985
Colonel Kitchner,
chief of Scotland Yard,

98
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,516
please inform General Fang

99
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:58,129
what other items were stolen
from the bank.

100
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:01,628
Nothing else.

101
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:05,144
Exactly. It seems
your little land dispute

102
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:08,352
has spilled over
onto our noble shore.

103
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,943
Until the Jade Buddha
is back in my possession,

104
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:16,242
you and your cause will receive no
British military assistance whatsoever.

105
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,788
Kitchner.

106
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:25,409
My agents will retrieve the Jade
Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.

107
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:28,933
This time, do not let it
slip through your fingers.

108
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:48,582
A female general.

109
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:51,860
What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

110
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:57,745
Cor!

111
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,514
- Come away from here.
- Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?

112
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,053
My wind-powered pulley system

113
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:14,640
circulates the house with fresh air.

114
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,691
Kitchen items are to be placed
on the white boat,

115
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,258
and the blue is for laundry.

116
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:22,696
But most importantly,
this supplies the house

117
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:25,993
with a running current of electricity.

118
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,158
Electricity.

119
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:33,939
This is my comprehensive
data schedule and list of regulations.

120
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:37,917
It's quite simple. You're never
to divert one iota from my plans.

121
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:40,567
I must live my life
with total efficiency...

122
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:43,113
to maximize my inventing capacity,

123
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:46,960
thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind.

124
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:51,463
Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,
precise gentleman.

125
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:56,895
Thank you. Uh... Sorry.
What was your name? Ahem.

126
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:01,160
Passport. Too.

127
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:03,829
Passepartout.

128
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,885
Bottled light.

129
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:16,541
A miracle.

130
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,089
Hardly.

131
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:22,495
Just undiscovered science from
an American named Thomas Edison.

132
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:25,505
It turns on with a whistle.

133
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:30,793
Please don't do that.

134
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:32,940
Ah, I see your eye is drawn

135
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:36,579
to what I hope will one day
be my crowning achievement.

136
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,557
A giant moth?

137
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:43,273
- It's a flying machine.
- It can fly?

138
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:45,516
Yes.

139
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,362
No. But it will... one day.

140
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:51,483
One day it will transport people
through the air.

141
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:54,500
Perhaps over entire oceans.

142
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:58,267
Uh-oh.

143
00:11:58,424 --> 00:12:01,326
I'm going to have
to make a rule for this.

144
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,764
Dear Father:

145
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:20,480
I will find the fastest way
back to China...

146
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:23,081
to make our village safe once again.

147
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:40,240
Passepartout?

148
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:45,035
Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes.

149
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:46,613
Prepare my urban transport device.

150
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,595
Prepare my urban transport device.

151
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,402
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

152
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:52,308
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

153
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,207
Clear the way. Clear the way.

154
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,652
Mr. Fogg coming through.
Watch out! Watch out!

155
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,862
Excuse me. Out of way.

156
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:06,214
- Gangway.
- Fogg's arrived.

157
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:08,662
- Gangway. Ooh!
- Hey!

158
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:11,545
That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon.

159
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,661
That will be all.

160
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,994
Gentlemen.

161
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,473
Today I have proved that man

162
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:25,490
can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier

163
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,046
without disrupting
his internal organs.

164
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:32,664
Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

165
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:35,187
What am I thinking? What a fool.

166
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:38,354
That would mean that you
were a real scientist!

167
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:42,944
By your definition,
a real scientist's objective

168
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:45,300
would be to prevent man from progress.

169
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:48,338
We live in a golden age, Fogg.

170
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:51,436
Everything worth discovering
has been discovered.

171
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:53,676
Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist

172
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,036
on a past filled with dinosaurs...

173
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:58,705
and evolution.

174
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,948
And on a future filled

175
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:02,968
with motorized vehicles,

176
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:05,352
radio waves,

177
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,373
and flying machines!

178
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:10,620
Confound it! The bloody
Bank of England is a madhouse!

179
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:15,507
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.
An Asian chap.

180
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:19,030
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.

181
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:23,845
Nothing.

182
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:31,629
Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,
and he acted alone.

183
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:42,344
No. Actually,
they say he was Norwegian.

184
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:49,558
In fact, though, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians.

185
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,918
I heard it from a very reliable source

186
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,947
that it was a gang
of redheaded elderly Norwegians

187
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,477
with very tiny feet.

188
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,327
It's about time
someone robbed that bank.

189
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:04,646
Like this very institution,

190
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,752
the Bank of England is outdated.

191
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:09,847
As usual, your contempt
for tradition is appalling.

192
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:14,118
You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer,

193
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,998
but, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.

194
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:21,626
So now you're an expert
on the bank thief as well.

195
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:25,091
Give us the benefit
of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.

196
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:31,600
Twenty-six minutes ago,
a ship left Dover for Paris.

197
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,359
From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express,

198
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,803
where he transfers to a steamer,
from Istanbul to India.

199
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,433
In little over a month,
that man could be in China.

200
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:45,854
If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,
he will have circled the globe

201
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,974
and returned to England in a fortnight.

202
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,644
Actually, by my calculations, it would
be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.

203
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:08,077
Outstanding idea.

204
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,129
Well, then, Fogg,

205
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:13,027
let's see you circumnavigate the world

206
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:15,548
in 80 days.

207
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:20,542
I... That would be
a fruitless use of my time.

208
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:22,892
I'm on the verge of numerous...

209
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:25,423
countless... scientific breakthroughs.

210
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,727
You coward. Admit it.
It cannot be done.

211
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,380
It can! I could do it.

212
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,803
A wager.

213
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,068
£10,000.

214
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,036
Unlike you and your colleagues,
money does not inspire me.

215
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,221
I believe every man has his price.

216
00:16:47,446 --> 00:16:51,375
Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.

217
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:56,059
There must be something I could offer
that would be worthy of your time.

218
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:02,871
There is. Your position as head
of the Royal Academy.

219
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,354
I could lead Britain
and the rest of the world

220
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:12,057
into a new age of progress
and discovery.

221
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,333
- Fair enough.
- What?

222
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:22,959
I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow

223
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:27,590
to surrender my position as minister
of science to Phileas Fogg...

224
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:29,862
- No!
- No! No!

225
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:33,798
if he can circumnavigate
the globe...

226
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,483
in no more than 80 days.

227
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:40,338
But if he cannot,

228
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,362
he must never set foot
in this academy again,

229
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:50,220
he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore
he calls a laboratory,

230
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,965
and he must swear...

231
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:56,081
never to invent again.

232
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:02,157
Just as I always suspected, Fogg.

233
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:05,639
You promise so much, yet you deliver...

234
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:07,386
oh, nothing.

235
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,668
- I'll take your wager.
- What did you say?

236
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,524
I'll take your wager!

237
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:18,946
He did it.

238
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,367
Then it's done.

239
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:28,636
A man who has never set foot
out of England circling the globe.

240
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,907
This is going to be rather amusing.

241
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:39,478
History won't remember your amusement,
but it will be hard-pressed to forget

242
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,199
the moment I'm standing on the very top
step of the Royal Academy of Science.

243
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:47,399
By the strike of noon,

244
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:51,245
after I, Phileas Fogg,
have traveled around the world

245
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:54,245
in 80 days!

246
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,355
Oh, dear.

247
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:08,698
Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?

248
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:12,055
Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!

249
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:16,211
- Uh...
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?

250
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,153
Huh?

251
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,153
Uh, Passepartout.

252
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:24,182
Would you... sit with me a moment?

253
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:30,956
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,645
I risked everything,
my entire life's work.

255
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,989
For something you believe in.

256
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,092
Nothing could make
more sense than that, sir.

257
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,454
You are honorable, Passepartout.

258
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:59,250
But I'm afraid this was
a calamitous lapse of judgment.

259
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:05,301
- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?

260
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,828
- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.

261
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:13,482
This house and my inventions
are all I have.

262
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:23,046
And a brave French valet that will help
you make it around the world in 80 days.

263
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:30,751
- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.

264
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:34,188
Yes. Yes. Yes!

265
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:37,244
You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India.

266
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:41,688
We're with you, sir!

267
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:46,877
Good luck!

268
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,547
Halt!

269
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:59,812
- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.

270
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:05,630
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain
you and your valet until further notice.

271
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,162
This here doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code.

272
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:12,538
Vehicle code?

273
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,370
Code 431.

274
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:18,443
All vehicles
must be powered by horses.

275
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:22,362
Or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like,

276
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,378
excluding giraffes and...

277
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:26,051
You're driveling. Stand aside.

278
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:28,682
I'm about to embark upon
a journey around the world.

279
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:31,284
Not in this monstrosity,
you're not. No!

280
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,352
- Mm-mm.
- That's hot.

281
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,056
It's... Ow!

282
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:50,264
Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.

283
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,746
Stealing a police vehicle is not
an acceptable way to begin our journey.

284
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:56,058
- Not stealing. Borrowing.
- Excuse us.

285
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:59,091
We're borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris,

286
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:01,943
if someone could inform
the appropriate authorities.

287
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:14,270
Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!

288
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,238
Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.

289
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,801
What's the point of hiring
a corrupt police officer

290
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:24,348
if he can't abuse the law properly?

291
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:25,891
- Kitchner.
- Sir!

292
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,874
Tell Fix to pack his bags.

293
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,963
- He's going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.

294
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:21,388
Hmm. Smart man.

295
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,875
Passepartout, tell this
impudent fellow we must

296
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:28,266
leave within six and a half hours, or we
miss our connection in Constantinople.

297
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:31,297
Yes, sir. Please.
We are in a great hurry.

298
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:32,694
- Passepartout?
- Yes?

299
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,794
In French.

300
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:42,383
Sacre bleu, la champignon,

301
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:46,586
chateau, bien, françoise, voilà,
ooh-la-la, foie de gras.

302
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:54,832
- What did he say?
- Uh...

303
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:56,890
He say...

304
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,856
- What?
- He says not to worry.

305
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,949
The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.

306
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:14,638
Passepartout, this is
a scientific expedition, not a holiday!

307
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:16,869
I will not miss this train.

308
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:20,520
Ah!

309
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,326
- Very amazing.
- What?

310
00:24:22,468 --> 00:24:23,995
What does it say?

311
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:26,439
Eddie Thomason will be
showing his inventions.

312
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,745
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

313
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:31,778
What a chance for you
to meet another great inventor.

314
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:35,491
I would quite like to tell him
about my whistle modification.

315
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:36,795
Good idea.

316
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,289
See? Exposition. Science.

317
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:00,821
I assure you these are not
the works of Thomas Edison.

318
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:03,429
Uh, I think he is
somewhere around here.

319
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:07,787
Wait a moment. This isn't science.

320
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:10,406
This is art.

321
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,925
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

322
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,157
That painting is highly inaccurate.

323
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,971
It's not supposed
to be accurate.

324
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:22,000
The artist views reality
through imagination

325
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:25,327
rather than simply recording it.

326
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:28,117
It is called "lmpressionism."

327
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:32,668
Well, um, I'm not impressed.

328
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:36,287
Trees are not violet,
grass is not charcoal,

329
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:38,298
and a man cannot...

330
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:50,495
fly.

331
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,533
You feel something.

332
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:54,882
You dream of flying.

333
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,647
Or of naked men.

334
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:00,198
- Sometimes.
- Ah.

335
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:03,400
The flying. N-N-Not the men.

336
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,418
I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.

337
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,665
Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot
better than these amateurs.

338
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,885
What did he say?

339
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,233
Oh, no.

340
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:31,507
Non.

341
00:26:47,547 --> 00:26:50,264
Goodness. What was that all about?

342
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,225
Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.

343
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,844
Champagne for everyone!

344
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,064
I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.

345
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:19,529
Have you considered
a career in schematic drawing?

346
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,931
No. It would be far too limiting.

347
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:25,318
At least your work
shows genuine promise.

348
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,628
Thank you. Those I painted
many months ago.

349
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,712
I was lacking inspiration.

350
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:36,341
I found some men
to help me find Mr. "Edimon."

351
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:40,446
- This way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

352
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,677
He's very eager.

353
00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:47,247
Get him!

354
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:58,911
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it's terrible, no?

355
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,612
No, no, it's...

356
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:01,964
- clever.
- Oh.

357
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:03,233
Hmm. Yes.

358
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,218
- He's a clown.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,334
And yet...

360
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,632
he's incredibly angry.

361
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:13,124
The irony is, uh, terrifying.

362
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:15,254
- Is that good?
- Is it?

363
00:28:44,797 --> 00:28:46,138
Ah, this is interesting.

364
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:50,667
Without opposable thumbs,
a dog could never play poker.

365
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,009
Yes, they can.

366
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:55,081
Where have you seen
a dog playing poker?

367
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,733
Right there.

368
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:33,313
Perhaps I'm not the best judge.

369
00:29:35,747 --> 00:29:38,747
Bandits! They come to take away
all the paintings!

370
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:52,056
- Quickly! Come this way!
- Passepartout!

371
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:55,975
Go, go, go!

372
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:21,878
Thank you, Miss La Roche.
You may just have saved our trip.

373
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:24,515
- There you are.
- I would, uh...

374
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:27,378
- I would like to repay you.
- Take me with you.

375
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:31,143
- What?
- I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.

376
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:34,849
They think of me only
as a coat-check girl!

377
00:30:35,073 --> 00:30:38,422
- Why?
- Because I am the coat-check girl.

378
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,155
- Ah.
- Look.

379
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:42,797
The leading art critic in Paris.

380
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,369
Look what he wrote
about one of my paintings.

381
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:49,364
- I can't read this. It's French.
- I wish I couldn't.

382
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:51,179
Why do you carry it?

383
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:56,078
When I do succeed,
I can throw it in his face, but for now,

384
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:59,208
I need a world journey to inspire me.

385
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,463
I'm inspired to get us
back on schedule.

386
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,966
Let's see. Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots,

387
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,860
factoring in air density...

388
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:16,256
Outstanding!

389
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,511
Passepartout, onward! Ah.

390
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:29,692
There we go. Passepartout,
tell him to keep the change.

391
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:32,229
Uh...
fromage, por favor.

392
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:35,903
We are going around
the world in 80 days!

393
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:43,844
The balloon cannot
support all this weight!

394
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,408
Your hot air should compensate, no?

395
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:48,485
Get off!

396
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,937
- What are they doing?
- They're being disorderly.

397
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:01,065
Hey! Let go! Let go!

398
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,863
Hey! Passepartout!
My valise! It has all my money in it.

399
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:20,077
Hey, lady, lady, lady! It's my bag.

400
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:22,099
No, that is my bag.

401
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:24,734
No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!

402
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:25,929
- No!
- You crazy.

403
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,478
Yes.

404
00:32:27,618 --> 00:32:31,327
That tickles!

405
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:39,802
You took my bag.

406
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,687
Mr. Fogg!

407
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,345
- Good catch!
- Thank you.

408
00:32:57,347 --> 00:32:58,525
Ooh!

409
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:04,426
Those are the gallery bandits.

410
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,137
Oh, yes!

411
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,240
Ah.

412
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:25,568
He stole my purse!
This devil stole my purse!

413
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,655
My bag! He took my... Ah!

414
00:33:53,036 --> 00:33:56,746
- We've stolen that old lady's purse.
- Huh. Here.

415
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:04,036
We must help Passepartout.
How do I make this go lower?

416
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:06,900
What are you doing?
Decrease the overall weight...

417
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:09,222
- That's not going to work.
- Yes, it is.

418
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:15,180
Physics, no?

419
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,116
Yes.

420
00:34:31,508 --> 00:34:33,418
Ahhh...

421
00:34:33,578 --> 00:34:35,782
Ooh! Ay! Owww.

422
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,067
Bonjour.

423
00:34:47,224 --> 00:34:50,158
Bonjour.

424
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:53,171
- Eh?
- Bye-bye!

425
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:03,177
Wake up, lady! Wake up, lady!

426
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:10,078
Wake up! Lady, wake up!

427
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,045
- Bye, mama.
- Merci.

428
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:22,152
Bye, baby.

429
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:26,672
Ohh...

430
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,218
Very impressive. I'd have let go by now.

431
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:43,667
The statue's grabbing his trousers.

432
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,920
I don't think it's doing it on purpose.

433
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,493
Oh, dear.

434
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:14,492
Help!

435
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:24,113
Well done, Passepartout.

436
00:36:24,254 --> 00:36:27,102
We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves.

437
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,112
Yes, yes. Thank you.

438
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,228
Those art thieves
seemed to recognize you.

439
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:41,839
- I look like someone they know.
- Some other Frenchman, perhaps?

440
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:49,577
- So, where can we drop you off?
- We're not stopping.

441
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,727
Once we land to board
the Orient Express, you are free to go.

442
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,291
Thank you so much.

443
00:36:55,353 --> 00:36:57,774
- For what?
- I'm free to go with you.

444
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:00,409
I did not say you were free to come.

445
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,348
- I said you were free to go.
- Where?

446
00:37:03,393 --> 00:37:05,727
- Anywhere.
- Thank you. I will go with you.

447
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:10,864
- No, you will not, Miss La Roche.
- Monique.

448
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:12,214
Miss... Monique!

449
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:14,165
There! Now we are getting along.

450
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,382
Comme c'est beau.

451
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:21,584
C'est magnifique.

452
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:25,006
Toutes ces couleurs.

453
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:28,761
Look at the sunrise.
There is only one word for it.

454
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:31,474
- "Magical."
- Miss La Roche!

455
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:34,525
I refuse to allow you
to continue traveling with us.

456
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:38,588
I'm not traveling with you.
I'm making my own way.

457
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:40,717
Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.

458
00:37:40,864 --> 00:37:43,385
This is what happens
when you leave your home.

459
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,350
You meet... people!

460
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:57,910
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

461
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:06,601
Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,
and together he and I can speculate.

462
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:20,160
A very sacred object
was stolen from my village.

463
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:22,312
I have taken it back.

464
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:33,761
Incroyable.

465
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:38,461
For many centuries, the Jade Buddha
has protected my people.

466
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:41,788
It has never left our village until now.

467
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:47,696
And those art thieves. Who are they?

468
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:52,274
The Black Scorpions.
They work for an evil warlord. Fang.

469
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:55,983
She wants the Buddha
so she can take over my village.

470
00:38:56,206 --> 00:39:00,101
I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.

471
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:03,027
Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.

472
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:07,960
Perhaps, then,
we can help one another.

473
00:39:08,852 --> 00:39:12,431
I will keep your secret,
and you convince Mr. Fogg

474
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:15,078
to allow me to travel
the world with you.

475
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,577
Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!

476
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:32,365
Merely pointing out if they coordinated
their coal-shoveling technique,

477
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:35,838
they could maximize our speed.

478
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:42,422
When we reach Constantinople, I suggest
you board a train we are not on.

479
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:48,159
- Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.
- And why is that?

480
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:53,063
Uh, we just discovered that we are
related from the same family.

481
00:39:56,266 --> 00:40:01,384
I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side. French.

482
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:07,050
Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train
go faster, I can come with you, oui?

483
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:09,863
Yes.

484
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,968
I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.

485
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:35,060
If there's anything else you would like,
just let us know, Miss La Roche.

486
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:37,596
Ah! Voilà.

487
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:41,768
Champagne with your first-class seats,
Mademoiselle La Roche.

488
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:43,092
Merci.

489
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,421
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

490
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,277
- Merci.
- Monsieur.

491
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,435
A tea?

492
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:23,033
Okay.

493
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:28,338
How to make English tea.

494
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,778
Precisely 96 degrees.

495
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,680
Ooh.

496
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:41,364
Excuse me, sir.

497
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:44,351
- Fogg's valet!

498
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:47,443
- A jade Buddha!
- This is not a jade Buddha.

499
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:51,669
- Oh, yes, it is!
- You're right. But I'm not a valet.

500
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:53,825
Oh. Really?

501
00:41:55,585 --> 00:41:56,730
Owww!

502
00:41:58,021 --> 00:41:59,963
Me bloody nose!

503
00:42:00,157 --> 00:42:03,801
Let me in!
You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!

504
00:42:18,508 --> 00:42:21,028
Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.

505
00:42:22,312 --> 00:42:25,312
Ow! Oh! Ow!

506
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:28,515
Ahhh!

507
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,628
You're under arrest!

508
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:34,892
Ah! Ooh! Ow!

509
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,301
Sorry!

510
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:56,220
Why the devil are we stopping?

511
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:06,324
Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Fogg

512
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:08,693
and his traveling companions
at his banquet.

513
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:10,486
How very flattering.

514
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:14,557
But please inform Prince "Happy"
that we are on a very tight schedule.

515
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:18,416
Prince Hapi demands it.

516
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:22,368
Then Prince Hapi
will have to get accustomed

517
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:24,712
to not getting everything he wants.

518
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:34,324
It is magnificent.

519
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:37,202
Mr. Fogg, his house
is even bigger than yours.

520
00:43:37,388 --> 00:43:41,033
His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.

521
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:42,688
Yes, it is.

522
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:46,930
Not good.
Very old. Look. Broken.

523
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:50,001
And where is His Highness?

524
00:43:58,676 --> 00:44:02,321
Oh. The prince is also
a talented musician.

525
00:44:02,547 --> 00:44:05,165
If I did nothing
but lounge about the palace,

526
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,389
I'd learn to pluck a few notes.

527
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:22,917
Let's make this brief.
I'll pose for photographs,

528
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,021
wearing a turban,
holding an atlas...

529
00:44:25,202 --> 00:44:26,609
Mademoiselle.

530
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:33,829
How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?

531
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:35,639
Is that what you call it

532
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:38,332
when one stops a train
and kidnaps its passengers?

533
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:40,524
Phileas Fogg.

534
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:42,145
Please forgive me,

535
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:46,695
but I feel like Aphrodite herself
descended to Earth.

536
00:44:47,725 --> 00:44:49,635
What is a ravishing
woman like you...

537
00:44:51,695 --> 00:44:56,451
- I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.

538
00:44:56,734 --> 00:44:58,392
- Yes. Well, I mean...
- No!

539
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:00,456
Don't touch it!

540
00:45:00,638 --> 00:45:05,821
- That is my most treasured possession.
- I was only pointing. I was just...

541
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,899
Don't even point.

542
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:09,605
Rodin.

543
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:12,747
Yes. A Rodin.

544
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,292
Oh.

545
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:17,767
I have never seen a more beautiful...
muscular form.

546
00:45:17,988 --> 00:45:21,817
Well, I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.

547
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,191
Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!

548
00:45:25,396 --> 00:45:26,541
Yes.

549
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:29,633
"Hapi Birthday.
Your pal, Rodin."

550
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:33,064
- Come, my dear. Let us dine.
- Yes.

551
00:45:35,073 --> 00:45:37,920
Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.

552
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:40,018
No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.

553
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:42,993
We will join you, actually.
But just one drink.

554
00:45:49,053 --> 00:45:52,217
After the duke and the duchess
sat down in the bath,

555
00:45:52,423 --> 00:45:54,976
I realized I forgot
to put on my bathing suit.

556
00:46:01,098 --> 00:46:02,374
I'm such a fool.

557
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:06,395
Always embarrassing myself
in front of visiting dignitaries.

558
00:46:06,671 --> 00:46:09,573
But you know how that can be,
right, Phil?

559
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:11,694
Uh, yes.

560
00:46:11,843 --> 00:46:14,461
Uh, it's Phileas, actually.

561
00:46:14,645 --> 00:46:18,158
So, Foggy, tell me.
I heard you're an inventor.

562
00:46:18,382 --> 00:46:21,611
Well, I try to apply myself
to thinking of new ways

563
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:24,307
to help better mankind,
if that's what you mean.

564
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,344
Well, I'm not an inventor,

565
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,970
but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land

566
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:33,041
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.

567
00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:34,343
Oh.

568
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,375
Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.

569
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:43,761
Not now, Passepartout.

570
00:46:46,043 --> 00:46:47,766
Oh.

571
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:49,318
Mmm.

572
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:50,907
- Miss La Roche.
- Hmm?

573
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:55,075
It is mesmerizing,
the way your face illuminates.

574
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:56,464
Oh...

575
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:59,270
Her discoloration could be
an allergic reaction

576
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:02,009
or a mild form of hives.

577
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:07,493
Although I've noticed a certain

578
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:11,243
luminescent glow about her
complexion when she's drawing.

579
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:15,846
And sometimes, when she's...
concentrating on her latest work,

580
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,595
her ears will actually flutter.

581
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:25,854
- It's rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.

582
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:29,051
U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.

583
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:33,575
Shouldn't we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.

584
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:35,732
Thank you for your hospitality.

585
00:47:35,893 --> 00:47:39,439
It's been absolutely fascinating,
but I'm afraid we must push on.

586
00:47:39,664 --> 00:47:40,646
Yes.

587
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:42,686
Very well.
The gentlemen are free to go.

588
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:46,150
But Miss La Roche...
stays here with me.

589
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,880
- To be my wife.
- Hmm?

590
00:47:49,073 --> 00:47:51,561
Yes. Wife number seven.

591
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,541
- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.

592
00:47:58,282 --> 00:48:01,577
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!

593
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:03,191
Prince Hapi has spoken!

594
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:09,404
Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we're leaving.

595
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:11,666
I can tell when we're not wanted.

596
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:16,881
Monsieur Fogg!

597
00:48:18,168 --> 00:48:20,340
Do Tuesdays work for you?

598
00:48:21,472 --> 00:48:24,123
- Good-bye.
- Thank you!

599
00:48:28,212 --> 00:48:30,546
No!

600
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:32,697
Halt!

601
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:34,845
Or Hapi gets smashed!

602
00:48:34,986 --> 00:48:38,946
Please! Anything but my statue of me!

603
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:42,571
Miss La Roche,
please join us, if you will.

604
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:48,406
- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!

605
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:52,519
- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!

606
00:48:52,737 --> 00:48:55,998
- Now!
- Let's go. Come on.

607
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:06,769
Now, take off your clothes
and throw them... Uh...

608
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:10,792
I assure you the statue is not
armed... harmed in any way.

609
00:49:26,537 --> 00:49:29,319
Get them!

610
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,784
His arm!

611
00:49:35,145 --> 00:49:37,317
Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.

612
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:40,035
Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.

613
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:43,348
This is exactly why
I should never have let you come along.

614
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:44,732
Kill them!

615
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:49,001
I want my arm!

616
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:52,227
No!

617
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,008
Sir! I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix.

618
00:49:56,265 --> 00:49:58,370
- A-ha!
- According to him,

619
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:01,668
the bank thief and Fogg's valet
are the same man.

620
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:04,806
Fogg doesn't realize
he's transporting the bank thief!

621
00:50:05,008 --> 00:50:09,198
Or does he?
He did leave town in quite a hurry.

622
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:11,333
Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

623
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:13,336
Indeed, Lord Salisbury.

624
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:15,425
Eh, evading arrest,

625
00:50:15,587 --> 00:50:17,856
stealing a police vehicle,

626
00:50:18,022 --> 00:50:20,640
sounds rather incriminating to me.

627
00:50:20,824 --> 00:50:22,647
One can almost deduce

628
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,444
this entire bet was merely a ruse

629
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,637
to facilitate his escape.

630
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:32,208
- Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.

631
00:50:32,437 --> 00:50:33,997
Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.

632
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:37,816
I shall name a beef-related entrée
after you in your honor! Kitchner!

633
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,049
- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yard

634
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:45,393
that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt
the man who robbed the Bank of England!

635
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:49,099
- Where are they now?
- They're taking a train across India,

636
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:50,781
from Bombay to Calcutta.

637
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,093
Thank God we own India!

638
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,527
I want their faces
in every police station,

639
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:58,081
army barracks, post office,
railway station and outhouse in India!

640
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,983
We're going to stop Fogg
and get my Jade Buddha back

641
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:05,819
by any means necessary!

642
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,298
Agra is where we will capture them!

643
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:26,891
Intercept them at Agra!

644
00:51:27,058 --> 00:51:28,716
Carry on, Cutter!

645
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,193
Move it! Move it! Fall in!

646
00:51:42,372 --> 00:51:45,089
And they were
the greatest kung fu boxers.

647
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:47,731
Ten Tigers of Canton.

648
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:49,154
Brothers in arms.

649
00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:51,930
They fought to keep order
and justice in China.

650
00:51:52,115 --> 00:51:55,432
The most famous of Ten Tigers
is Wong Fei Hung.

651
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:02,792
Armed with
only bamboo sticks...

652
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:04,936
It's salivating on... please.

653
00:52:05,095 --> 00:52:06,523
Is this your goat?

654
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:08,736
Did they really fight like tigers?

655
00:52:08,932 --> 00:52:12,031
Each Tiger have their own
animal fighting style.

656
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,473
Like tiger.

657
00:52:14,638 --> 00:52:17,572
Snake. Snake head, snake tail,
snake mouth, snake tongue!

658
00:52:18,743 --> 00:52:20,401
Where are my calculations?

659
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:21,885
Monkey!

660
00:52:23,013 --> 00:52:26,493
The goat! Passepartout, I'm being
attacked by a ferocious animal!

661
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:30,686
- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.

662
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:33,669
Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me.

663
00:52:33,856 --> 00:52:35,831
And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.

664
00:52:35,993 --> 00:52:38,775
Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?

665
00:52:39,463 --> 00:52:41,121
It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.

666
00:52:41,898 --> 00:52:46,121
How could a man learn to defend himself
by watching animals behave like...

667
00:52:46,404 --> 00:52:48,705
- animals?
- It is famous legend.

668
00:52:48,872 --> 00:52:52,669
- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.

669
00:52:52,943 --> 00:52:54,633
Yes.

670
00:52:54,778 --> 00:52:58,095
But all truths are born from facts.

671
00:52:58,316 --> 00:53:00,901
Solid, tangible facts
that can be calculated

672
00:53:01,084 --> 00:53:02,742
and written down on paper.

673
00:53:02,885 --> 00:53:06,562
And then eaten by a goat.

674
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:09,725
Mr. Feelsillious,
when I tell the story

675
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:13,057
of the man who circled
the entire world in 80 days,

676
00:53:13,263 --> 00:53:15,500
would that not be a legend?

677
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:21,054
Only if the man's name
was Feelsillious Frog.

678
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:30,382
- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way! Come on!

679
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:33,397
Look sharp, now. Get 'em!

680
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:35,077
Find these men!

681
00:53:35,218 --> 00:53:40,040
Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England.

682
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:43,324
Preposterous. This is a desperate
attempt by Lord Kelvin

683
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,673
to impede my journey.

684
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:47,150
I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.

685
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,508
Except bullets.

686
00:53:52,637 --> 00:53:54,841
Listen up!
Have you seen these men?

687
00:53:56,606 --> 00:53:58,613
Come on!

688
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:12,943
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

689
00:54:13,091 --> 00:54:15,611
They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.

690
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,254
They won't get past us, sir!

691
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:21,882
Ladies, have you seen these two men?

692
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,629
Look closely. They're very dangerous.

693
00:54:26,837 --> 00:54:29,739
They're everywhere!
This is not going to work!

694
00:54:29,973 --> 00:54:33,421
- Just act like ladies.
- Not a problem.

695
00:54:33,643 --> 00:54:36,360
Hello. Hello! Ah.

696
00:54:37,814 --> 00:54:40,945
- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!

697
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,224
No, but I am.

698
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:52,957
Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?

699
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:02,291
What nice hand,
nice eye, nice hair...

700
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,580
Hang about!

701
00:55:09,045 --> 00:55:11,914
Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.

702
00:55:12,115 --> 00:55:13,741
Stop, stop.

703
00:55:16,052 --> 00:55:19,827
Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.

704
00:55:20,056 --> 00:55:22,260
Passepartout, we did it.

705
00:55:27,664 --> 00:55:29,574
Hey, wrong way.

706
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:30,944
Ah!

707
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:37,711
Phileas? No! No!

708
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,285
Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!

709
00:55:44,481 --> 00:55:46,074
Ah! Ah!

710
00:55:46,183 --> 00:55:47,743
Ahhh!

711
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:49,641
Fogg's valet! Heh!

712
00:55:50,288 --> 00:55:52,426
- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!

713
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:54,617
Hand over the Jade Buddha!

714
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:57,008
Oh!

715
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:02,707
You're under arrest! Whoa!
Watch me plums! Ooh!

716
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:11,115
Now you get him very mad! Let's go.

717
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:13,446
Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!

718
00:56:22,552 --> 00:56:24,462
Run!

719
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,994
- Which way?
- Down!

720
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:30,068
Again!

721
00:56:31,528 --> 00:56:32,739
Down!

722
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,512
Jump!

723
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,953
- Go, go, go!
- What's upsetting him?

724
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:45,889
- He wants the Jade Buddha!
- Then give it to him!

725
00:56:49,846 --> 00:56:53,523
- Phileas, wake up!
- Please, please. You must go.

726
00:56:54,684 --> 00:56:58,459
- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!

727
00:57:11,301 --> 00:57:13,189
Ow! Ay!

728
00:57:17,174 --> 00:57:18,767
Phileas, help!

729
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:20,730
Leave her alone! I'll protect you!

730
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:22,732
Ah!

731
00:57:23,813 --> 00:57:25,307
I'm here, my dear.

732
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:28,351
Uh, that stumble was
simply to buy me time.

733
00:57:29,486 --> 00:57:32,650
This cane is not as it appears.

734
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:37,461
If I depress this button, it would
deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.

735
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:43,654
This... is...

736
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:46,420
a strange knife.

737
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:48,043
Isn't it a sextant?

738
00:57:49,005 --> 00:57:50,892
Yes.

739
00:57:57,681 --> 00:57:59,087
Huh.

740
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,562
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!

741
00:58:07,824 --> 00:58:09,679
You men, come with me!

742
00:58:09,826 --> 00:58:12,925
You'd better put this on.

743
00:58:13,129 --> 00:58:15,780
Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often.

744
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:22,447
Oh.

745
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:24,101
We should run.

746
00:58:24,273 --> 00:58:26,128
- What, now?
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,704
Yes, we should run.

748
00:58:33,116 --> 00:58:35,123
- Break down the door!
- Okay.

749
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,797
No, not me brains!

750
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:52,800
- Give me the Jade "Bu-ddha"!
- Okay, okay.

751
00:58:53,002 --> 00:58:54,692
What's "Bu-ddha"?

752
00:58:57,207 --> 00:58:59,826
Get ready to jump! Now!

753
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,922
It is him, the Englishman
who robbed the Bank of England!

754
00:59:17,126 --> 00:59:19,712
He's escaping in that palkee-garry!

755
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:22,166
Hey, there he is!

756
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,122
They'll check all trains heading east.

757
00:59:26,336 --> 00:59:30,526
If we could make it to the coast, we
can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.

758
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:33,971
- They're both British colonies.
- Does England own everything in Asia?

759
00:59:34,178 --> 00:59:37,494
Not China. Not yet.

760
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:33,143
Passepartout?

761
01:00:34,538 --> 01:00:39,393
- You look troubled.
- I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.

762
01:00:39,676 --> 01:00:41,269
You did what you had to.

763
01:00:41,411 --> 01:00:43,833
The fate of your village
is of far greater importance

764
01:00:44,048 --> 01:00:46,765
than any bet Phileas has made.

765
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:50,048
If he loses, all it will
cost him his money and pride.

766
01:00:50,254 --> 01:00:53,570
No, Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that.

767
01:00:54,657 --> 01:00:57,526
What do you mean?

768
01:01:02,232 --> 01:01:04,272
My village!

769
01:01:07,537 --> 01:01:11,083
- Your village?
- Uh... I mean,

770
01:01:11,307 --> 01:01:13,161
my, what a village!

771
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,717
Oh, it's beautiful!

772
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:19,049
We do need to stop and
resupply, but we must be off by morning.

773
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,358
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.

774
01:01:41,538 --> 01:01:44,124
Lau Xing.

775
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:47,439
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

776
01:01:56,887 --> 01:02:00,465
Goodness, that's quite a welcome.
Do these people know him?

777
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:04,367
It must be their custom,
the way they welcome all strangers.

778
01:02:04,594 --> 01:02:06,601
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

779
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:23,782
Whoo!

780
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:26,396
Lau Xing.

781
01:02:38,494 --> 01:02:39,923
Lau Xing.

782
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:43,554
Lau Xing.

783
01:02:45,669 --> 01:02:47,229
Ah. Uh...

784
01:03:14,064 --> 01:03:15,470
Oh. It's beautiful.

785
01:03:15,598 --> 01:03:17,485
You are very talented.

786
01:03:17,634 --> 01:03:18,943
Thank you.

787
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:22,179
You need more blue.

788
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:31,729
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.

789
01:03:34,484 --> 01:03:36,786
Sorry?

790
01:03:46,263 --> 01:03:47,277
Vile.

791
01:03:47,397 --> 01:03:50,212
Absolutely vile.

792
01:03:58,775 --> 01:04:00,630
Welcome home, Lau Xing.

793
01:04:04,414 --> 01:04:06,138
Your brothers will be proud.

794
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:09,000
The whole notion of
a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,

795
01:04:09,186 --> 01:04:11,706
unless you can
harness the power of helium.

796
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:13,830
Or hydrogen, which is far better...

797
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,329
Yes, well, couldn't have
put it better myself.

798
01:04:19,495 --> 01:04:24,351
As for this Englishman, do you think
such an association is wise?

799
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:27,701
He is the most disciplined man
I have ever met.

800
01:04:28,738 --> 01:04:30,625
The crane!

801
01:04:30,774 --> 01:04:32,813
The monkey. Very frightening.

802
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:36,791
Snake.

803
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:39,401
And, of course, the eagle.

804
01:04:42,686 --> 01:04:43,733
Phileas?

805
01:04:45,855 --> 01:04:49,019
Phileas, I made this for you.

806
01:04:49,225 --> 01:04:53,480
Oh, yes.
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.

807
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,875
What does this say?

808
01:04:54,997 --> 01:04:57,867
Stupid.

809
01:05:00,203 --> 01:05:01,577
Lau Xing...

810
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:31,708
I've had quite enough.

811
01:05:31,902 --> 01:05:33,844
I just... I...

812
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:02,078
Ahhh.

813
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:05,395
I am going to be abominably ill.

814
01:06:19,248 --> 01:06:21,583
I... I want to die.

815
01:06:22,686 --> 01:06:24,791
Please kill me.

816
01:06:58,354 --> 01:07:00,525
"Dear Father:

817
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,723
I will find the fastest way to China."

818
01:07:07,697 --> 01:07:09,355
It's strong.

819
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:20,426
Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.

820
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:30,212
- This is your family.
- My name is not Passepartout.

821
01:07:30,453 --> 01:07:32,144
It is Lau Xing.

822
01:07:33,022 --> 01:07:37,756
- I robbed the Bank of England.
- You robbed the Bank of England?

823
01:07:38,027 --> 01:07:41,605
Not for gold or money,
but for the Jade Buddha.

824
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:44,199
It was stolen from our village.

825
01:07:44,401 --> 01:07:49,932
Phileas, he had no other choice.
This was his only way to get home.

826
01:07:53,175 --> 01:07:56,404
- You knew about this?
- Well...

827
01:07:58,314 --> 01:08:00,867
I have nothing but respect
for you, Mr. Fogg.

828
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:05,804
Then respect my deductive reasoning.

829
01:08:05,988 --> 01:08:09,054
You have both used me.

830
01:08:09,258 --> 01:08:11,047
You to escape to China,

831
01:08:11,193 --> 01:08:14,259
and you to travel to further
your impressionistic humbug!

832
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:17,862
Your overtures of... comradeship,

833
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,042
of friendship, of...

834
01:08:24,473 --> 01:08:27,473
All that was a means to ensure
I would take you along.

835
01:08:27,678 --> 01:08:31,834
My entire life,
I got along splendidly by myself.

836
01:08:32,081 --> 01:08:35,975
You've been pebbles in my shoe,
slowing me down, endangering my life,

837
01:08:37,286 --> 01:08:40,221
risking everything,
all I've ever lived for.

838
01:08:40,423 --> 01:08:42,211
And you!

839
01:08:43,693 --> 01:08:45,286
You knew that.

840
01:08:58,809 --> 01:09:01,907
Don't let him go.
He'll be lost by midnight.

841
01:09:02,713 --> 01:09:04,306
Go!

842
01:09:08,284 --> 01:09:11,480
More of your relatives, I suppose.

843
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,658
You can just forget
about a reference.

844
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:23,245
I beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Fogg.

845
01:09:32,776 --> 01:09:34,685
What's he screaming about?

846
01:09:34,844 --> 01:09:37,299
He's saying, "Please, let me go.
I'm bored."

847
01:09:40,816 --> 01:09:42,758
Why is he in prison?

848
01:09:49,559 --> 01:09:51,730
Urinating in public.

849
01:09:51,894 --> 01:09:54,611
Charming.

850
01:09:54,798 --> 01:09:57,797
At least he had the decency
to be forthcoming about it.

851
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:00,882
Is there anything you've told me
that's even remotely true?

852
01:10:01,103 --> 01:10:02,729
I really can sing.

853
01:10:03,606 --> 01:10:06,573
# Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

854
01:10:06,776 --> 01:10:08,532
# Dormez-vous

855
01:10:08,678 --> 01:10:10,052
# Dormez-vous

856
01:10:10,179 --> 01:10:12,830
# Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines

857
01:10:13,015 --> 01:10:15,317
# Ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding #

858
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:18,419
Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.
Ding, dang, dong.

859
01:10:18,622 --> 01:10:20,891
Look!

860
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:28,329
Oh, good. Here comes
Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.

861
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:38,527
- Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off killing me.

862
01:10:39,909 --> 01:10:44,065
You have nerve.
Are your comrades so brave?

863
01:10:45,015 --> 01:10:48,276
Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your silly bracelet.

864
01:10:50,086 --> 01:10:52,769
All right. It's not silly.

865
01:10:52,955 --> 01:10:56,785
I spit on you! France spits on you!

866
01:10:57,027 --> 01:10:58,401
Vive I'Anjou!

867
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:02,212
- Your turn will come soon enough.
- Coward!

868
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,246
Leave them alone. Fight me.

869
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:07,410
Yes, fight him.

870
01:11:08,406 --> 01:11:10,740
Let's see how ferocious you really are.

871
01:11:58,922 --> 01:12:00,897
Hey, that's cheating!

872
01:12:02,325 --> 01:12:04,114
- Look out!
- Huh?

873
01:12:04,262 --> 01:12:06,302
Left!

874
01:12:10,268 --> 01:12:11,577
Behind you!

875
01:12:14,905 --> 01:12:16,530
No!

876
01:12:16,673 --> 01:12:19,805
- Hit them!
- Silence!

877
01:12:25,715 --> 01:12:26,893
You savages!

878
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:30,012
Phileas, help him!

879
01:12:30,153 --> 01:12:32,935
- Watch out on the right.
- Huh?

880
01:12:33,124 --> 01:12:34,552
No, my right.

881
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,134
Stop helping me!

882
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,049
What's happening?

883
01:12:39,197 --> 01:12:40,473
Where is Passepartout?

884
01:12:40,597 --> 01:12:42,026
How is he getting on?

885
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:46,256
I wouldn't say he's winning,
but, uh, I think he's doing all right.

886
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:56,650
Go home to mama.

887
01:13:11,161 --> 01:13:13,333
Huh?

888
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:17,814
- What took you so long?
- I had to finish my lunch.

889
01:13:28,044 --> 01:13:29,026
Wong Fei Hung!

890
01:13:30,081 --> 01:13:33,790
Surely you're not foolish enough
to take on all of my men by yourself?

891
01:13:39,556 --> 01:13:40,571
Ten Tigers?

892
01:13:49,066 --> 01:13:50,757
Kill them!

893
01:14:01,379 --> 01:14:04,477
Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!

894
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,882
What's happening?

895
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:21,289
Phileas!

896
01:14:27,904 --> 01:14:29,311
Ohhh!

897
01:14:31,275 --> 01:14:33,097
Passepartout... Knife!

898
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,594
- Merci.
- You're welcome.

899
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:13,547
You promise me that Black Scorpions
will never come back to Lanzhou.

900
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:37,977
These are my brothers and sister.
The Ten Tigers.

901
01:16:38,234 --> 01:16:41,267
- But there are only nine.
- Including me.

902
01:16:41,505 --> 01:16:42,879
They're real.

903
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,600
The legend was true.

904
01:17:33,656 --> 01:17:35,860
- Mr. Fogg...
- Passepartout,

905
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:38,360
or whatever your name is,
save your apologies.

906
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:42,238
Phileas, he risked his life
for what he believes in.

907
01:17:42,465 --> 01:17:44,472
If anyone understands that, you do.

908
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:48,082
Please ensure Miss La Roche
finds safe passage home.

909
01:17:48,338 --> 01:17:51,088
This should be adequate.

910
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:57,018
Oh.

911
01:17:57,147 --> 01:17:59,863
I, uh, believe this is your veil.

912
01:18:04,087 --> 01:18:07,121
I will never dress like a woman again.

913
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:10,545
Ever.

914
01:18:10,694 --> 01:18:13,955
Mr. Fogg.
Please let me help you win your bet.

915
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:19,307
I have secured the services
of a more reliable gentleman.

916
01:18:31,614 --> 01:18:33,588
Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,

917
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,343
travel alone.

918
01:19:27,571 --> 01:19:31,368
Fifi La Belle!
She sings! She dances!

919
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:35,121
She does the dance of the...
You, sir, come right in.

920
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:37,963
See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...

921
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:42,490
Ah, the most modern city in the world.

922
01:19:42,752 --> 01:19:45,567
Finally, civilization.

923
01:19:52,629 --> 01:19:55,150
Excuse me. Pardon me.

924
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:59,161
Can anyone direct me
to the Pacific Railroad Station?

925
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,126
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

926
01:20:04,307 --> 01:20:07,340
I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.

927
01:20:07,543 --> 01:20:09,878
No, no, no.
Please, it's my fault entirely.

928
01:20:10,046 --> 01:20:13,210
- Let me, uh...
- Oh... Ah!

929
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:16,199
Oh. Oh, Lord,
I think I sprained my knee.

930
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:18,328
Uh! Ooh.

931
01:20:18,488 --> 01:20:20,593
I should find you a physician.

932
01:20:20,757 --> 01:20:23,375
There's a doctor who has
an office around the corner.

933
01:20:23,559 --> 01:20:27,105
Excellent.
Well, uh, I'll get him for you.

934
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,410
Thank you.

935
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:31,826
There should be more people
like you in this world.

936
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,887
Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!

937
01:20:41,078 --> 01:20:43,631
Whoo!

938
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,583
Mon Dieu.

939
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:58,073
Can you imagine Phileas alone
in a place like this?

940
01:20:58,294 --> 01:20:59,788
I'm sure he's fine.

941
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:03,951
Alms.

942
01:21:04,134 --> 01:21:05,922
Alms.

943
01:21:07,336 --> 01:21:09,060
Alms for the poor?

944
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:14,855
Arms?

945
01:21:16,012 --> 01:21:19,427
You already got arms.
It's money you need.

946
01:21:20,484 --> 01:21:23,583
I can't even scrounge proficiently.

947
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:25,160
Hey.

948
01:21:25,822 --> 01:21:29,400
Cheer up, pal. You just gotta
figure out what'll work for you.

949
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:33,619
Now, what makes you
different from them?

950
01:21:33,864 --> 01:21:36,133
I'm hungry and miserable.

951
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,853
No. You stink.

952
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:43,824
Your stink is your most powerful weapon
in your begging arsenal.

953
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:45,733
Watch this.

954
01:21:48,377 --> 01:21:50,101
Hey.

955
01:21:50,246 --> 01:21:52,734
- Give me money.
- Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.

956
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:57,265
- That guy smells like a dead horse!
- I'm not proud of it.

957
01:21:57,453 --> 01:22:00,103
Simple, yet effective.

958
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:01,718
- Yeah, I see.
- You try.

959
01:22:01,858 --> 01:22:04,793
Give it a shot. I got faith in you.

960
01:22:05,729 --> 01:22:09,657
Excuse me. Now, uh, you...

961
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:14,217
Ah.

962
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:18,079
I'm not gonna lie to you.
That's gonna happen about half the time.

963
01:22:20,911 --> 01:22:22,820
It's a volume business.

964
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:28,114
- Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes, I would rather...

965
01:22:28,317 --> 01:22:29,844
Maybe later.

966
01:22:31,455 --> 01:22:34,270
What are them drawings?
You some kind of devil worshipper?

967
01:22:35,259 --> 01:22:37,714
Don't you be putting a hex on me.
I'll cut you.

968
01:22:39,196 --> 01:22:42,130
- I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.

969
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:44,568
Or, rather, I was.

970
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:56,705
One day I will build a machine
that will allow man to fly.

971
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,750
Flying men? Where?

972
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:04,629
- Nowhere.
- Where are the flying men?

973
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:06,926
- Where are the flying men?
- Over there.

974
01:23:07,089 --> 01:23:09,293
The bird men are coming! I knew it!

975
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:12,393
The bird men are coming!
The bird men are coming!

976
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:14,865
The birds! The bird men!

977
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,919
Bird men! Birds!

978
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:29,275
"I traveled the world for inspiration

979
01:23:29,478 --> 01:23:34,148
and found it in a man...
who lives what he dreams."

980
01:24:15,224 --> 01:24:18,159
- Phileas?
- No.

981
01:24:19,195 --> 01:24:21,616
Passepartout! Monique!

982
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:25,282
Mr. Fogg.

983
01:24:27,837 --> 01:24:31,612
You crossed the Pacific Ocean.
For me?

984
01:24:31,842 --> 01:24:35,770
- We will help you win your bet.
- Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.

985
01:24:36,979 --> 01:24:40,328
- But why would you do this?
- Because you are our friend,

986
01:24:40,549 --> 01:24:43,299
and perhaps... more.

987
01:24:45,021 --> 01:24:48,501
More with her. You and me?
We just stick with friends.

988
01:24:50,726 --> 01:24:52,287
- Ooh.
- Oof!

989
01:24:52,429 --> 01:24:56,455
Lord Kelvin, I can
offer you something much more precious

990
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:58,771
than a single Jade Buddha.

991
01:24:58,935 --> 01:25:02,612
Beneath Lanzhou are a series
of untapped jade reserves.

992
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:07,474
If the town were to be overrun,
those reserves would be ours.

993
01:25:07,741 --> 01:25:08,854
I see.

994
01:25:08,976 --> 01:25:12,009
However, should Phileas Fogg
win this race,

995
01:25:12,212 --> 01:25:17,002
I will have neither the power nor
the means to hand over any arsenal.

996
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:22,303
Then I will see to it personally
that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.

997
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:26,616
Very well.
Let us consider our deal to be...

998
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:31,977
Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.

999
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:36,323
What's this blocking my jade reserves?
That will have to be demolished.

1000
01:25:36,603 --> 01:25:37,880
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1001
01:25:38,005 --> 01:25:39,892
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1002
01:25:41,075 --> 01:25:42,668
It's not that great.

1003
01:25:53,087 --> 01:25:56,283
Passepartout went
to get help hours ago.

1004
01:25:56,491 --> 01:25:58,727
What if he's lost, or...

1005
01:25:58,892 --> 01:26:00,616
Don't fret, my dear.

1006
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:04,852
Passepartout's a warrior
with impeccable survival instincts.

1007
01:26:05,099 --> 01:26:09,092
No doubt he'll return with help, and we
will board our train with time to spare.

1008
01:26:09,371 --> 01:26:10,778
Agua.

1009
01:26:11,872 --> 01:26:14,556
Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.

1010
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:15,952
Help!

1011
01:26:16,076 --> 01:26:17,898
- Help us!
- Help!

1012
01:26:18,046 --> 01:26:20,053
Ah! A rattlesnake!

1013
01:26:20,215 --> 01:26:21,197
Help!

1014
01:26:21,315 --> 01:26:23,486
I don't want to die!

1015
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:25,789
Ah. Good morning.

1016
01:26:27,821 --> 01:26:29,512
- Howdy.
- Hey.

1017
01:26:29,656 --> 01:26:31,958
Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.

1018
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:35,901
How's about going someplace else?
You're blocking the path.

1019
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:38,040
Wilbur, it's him.

1020
01:26:40,068 --> 01:26:41,245
I'll be damned.

1021
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:46,613
Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.
This is my brother, Wilbur.

1022
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,135
- We're big fans of yours.
- Fan's a strong word.

1023
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:54,949
Better way to say it's we got a lot
of money riding on you to win your bet.

1024
01:26:55,216 --> 01:26:57,453
We're gonna use
our winnings to build this.

1025
01:26:58,086 --> 01:27:00,900
Orville, maybe now is not the time.
Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.

1026
01:27:01,089 --> 01:27:05,628
Just one second. Forgive my brother.
He's got his head up in the clouds.

1027
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:10,203
He's one of these dreamers who thinks
man's gonna go swooshing around

1028
01:27:10,464 --> 01:27:13,431
on the planet
like a little hummingbird.

1029
01:27:13,635 --> 01:27:16,285
Yeah, we're all gonna fly.
He thinks so, too.

1030
01:27:16,503 --> 01:27:19,373
It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.
He's kind of a moron.

1031
01:27:19,606 --> 01:27:23,861
He's mastered the cable steering system.
The drag-and-lift ratio.

1032
01:27:24,112 --> 01:27:26,021
- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.

1033
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:29,049
That's what I've been saying,
but Orville doesn't listen.

1034
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:32,064
All that stuff about mastering...
That's what I say.

1035
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:35,994
You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.

1036
01:27:36,223 --> 01:27:38,874
- But you told me...
- You gotta have confidence.

1037
01:27:39,059 --> 01:27:42,027
- You've got to speak up and support me.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1038
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:44,618
Have you come across our friend
on your way here?

1039
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:47,741
Who are we looking for?

1040
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:48,982
Passepartout.

1041
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,042
You mean the crazy,
half-naked Chinese guy

1042
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:54,214
we saw running around,
where he was like...

1043
01:27:54,409 --> 01:27:57,027
- Singing "Frère Jacques"?
- With a cow skull on his head?

1044
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,108
- Possibly.
- Yes.

1045
01:27:59,246 --> 01:28:02,508
- He's in the back of the wagon.
- Passepartout.

1046
01:28:02,716 --> 01:28:05,138
- You are alive!
- Is that you, Grandma?

1047
01:28:08,889 --> 01:28:11,256
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck. Go win the bet.

1048
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:15,070
- No pressure, but you gotta win it.
- Bye.

1049
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:19,125
Now, you see, to get the real
classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.

1050
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:21,788
I did.

1051
01:28:22,002 --> 01:28:23,890
"I did"? What's with the "I did"?

1052
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:27,169
We're the Wright Brothers.
We did. Now go.

1053
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:30,289
Hyah!

1054
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:41,338
They're not going to make it!

1055
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:57,516
Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!

1056
01:28:57,738 --> 01:29:00,105
So much to see! So little time!

1057
01:29:00,275 --> 01:29:02,544
Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!

1058
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,597
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

1059
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:17,323
- We're never going to make it.
- Phileas Fogg?

1060
01:29:21,129 --> 01:29:23,495
Autograph this for me?
It's for the wife.

1061
01:29:23,665 --> 01:29:27,559
Certainly. This business about me
robbing the Bank of England...

1062
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:30,103
Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.

1063
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:36,745
The boat. Follow me.
I know a shortcut. Make a lane!

1064
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:43,570
Make a lane!

1065
01:29:52,493 --> 01:29:54,216
Where are we?

1066
01:29:54,963 --> 01:29:57,450
- Ah!
- Whoa!

1067
01:29:57,631 --> 01:30:01,788
- That's a big man.
- It is a lady. A French lady.

1068
01:30:02,202 --> 01:30:05,497
She looks like an evil
Chinese warlord to me.

1069
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:19,632
Your journey has caused
quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,

1070
01:30:19,821 --> 01:30:21,675
but I'm afraid it ends here.

1071
01:30:21,823 --> 01:30:24,441
Leave them alone.
This has nothing to do with them.

1072
01:30:25,827 --> 01:30:28,128
On the contrary, Lau Xing,

1073
01:30:28,295 --> 01:30:32,518
Lord Kelvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.

1074
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:34,676
Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,

1075
01:30:34,868 --> 01:30:37,868
they entail his... permanent detour.

1076
01:30:38,106 --> 01:30:39,666
I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,

1077
01:30:39,841 --> 01:30:42,655
but to align himself
with such a little scoundrel!

1078
01:30:43,878 --> 01:30:46,529
You're not a scoundrel,
but you are quite small!

1079
01:30:48,782 --> 01:30:53,998
As in petite, but most definitely lethal
and generally very scary.

1080
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,345
One, two...

1081
01:30:59,259 --> 01:31:01,332
- Go!
- Three!

1082
01:31:06,967 --> 01:31:09,106
- Go up there.
- Stop them.

1083
01:31:15,677 --> 01:31:18,044
Passepartout, my cane!

1084
01:31:21,448 --> 01:31:22,561
Uh, there.

1085
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,607
Passepartout!
Help! We are trapped!

1086
01:32:06,493 --> 01:32:08,020
Help!

1087
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:14,046
Passepartout! Help!

1088
01:32:32,419 --> 01:32:33,696
There you are!

1089
01:32:36,956 --> 01:32:39,323
You have a knife in your buttock.

1090
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:08,592
It's the evil Chinese warlord!

1091
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:10,064
- Ooh!
- Huh?

1092
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,361
She's coming!

1093
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:17,152
The boat!

1094
01:33:17,297 --> 01:33:20,079
Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!

1095
01:33:21,234 --> 01:33:23,885
Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.

1096
01:33:42,656 --> 01:33:44,893
Wait, wait! What am I thinking?

1097
01:33:45,092 --> 01:33:46,750
Passepartout can't defeat them.

1098
01:33:46,861 --> 01:33:48,966
He's nine Tigers short.

1099
01:33:51,364 --> 01:33:56,001
Phileas, I do believe you are becoming
the man of my dreams.

1100
01:33:56,302 --> 01:33:58,724
When this is over,
let's hope the arms and legs

1101
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:01,754
of the man of your dreams
are still attached to the torso...

1102
01:34:01,942 --> 01:34:03,830
of the man of your dreams.

1103
01:34:31,071 --> 01:34:35,097
- You have failed to stop him.
- Then your death will have to suffice.

1104
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:56,335
Let go of me!

1105
01:34:56,463 --> 01:35:00,238
The book! It's going to fall!
How can we save...

1106
01:35:00,467 --> 01:35:02,540
- Phileas?
- I will save him...

1107
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:05,257
Wah!

1108
01:35:13,714 --> 01:35:15,339
Mr. Fogg!

1109
01:35:28,295 --> 01:35:30,084
No!

1110
01:35:42,443 --> 01:35:44,450
Oh. Passepartout?

1111
01:35:54,522 --> 01:35:56,824
Passepartout!

1112
01:35:56,991 --> 01:35:58,169
- Huh?
- You're alive!

1113
01:35:59,293 --> 01:36:01,748
Are you injured?

1114
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:09,812
Yes, well, uh...
Rules are made to be broken.

1115
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:12,788
Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.

1116
01:36:12,973 --> 01:36:16,803
Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.
You'll lose your bet.

1117
01:36:17,077 --> 01:36:20,590
Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.

1118
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:33,958
You must be the eleventh Tiger.

1119
01:36:34,495 --> 01:36:36,088
Meow!

1120
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:44,403
- Let's go. We must catch the next ship.
- It would never reach London in time.

1121
01:36:48,008 --> 01:36:50,375
No. No! No!

1122
01:36:50,577 --> 01:36:54,407
We are not giving up!
I almost died! You almost died!

1123
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:57,910
We take the next ship
and win that bet!

1124
01:37:00,754 --> 01:37:03,056
Very well.

1125
01:37:03,224 --> 01:37:04,817
- Let's go.
- Yes!

1126
01:37:05,893 --> 01:37:07,486
Thank you.

1127
01:37:42,962 --> 01:37:45,832
Yes. Yes! Yes!

1128
01:37:47,635 --> 01:37:49,610
Oh, it's hopeless.

1129
01:37:49,803 --> 01:37:52,618
By those calculations,
I'm still behind by one day.

1130
01:37:52,806 --> 01:37:57,541
- There must be some way!
- Phileas Fogg on my boat?

1131
01:37:58,611 --> 01:38:01,262
What an honor, sir!

1132
01:38:01,448 --> 01:38:05,060
I've quite a penny wagered on you.
The wife's none too happy about it.

1133
01:38:05,285 --> 01:38:09,922
Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile
since that shark almost devoured me.

1134
01:38:10,791 --> 01:38:13,027
Got 'em both in one bite.

1135
01:38:28,676 --> 01:38:31,294
Ah, it's Inspector Fix!

1136
01:38:31,478 --> 01:38:34,991
My goodness! He made it
around the world before Fogg!

1137
01:38:35,816 --> 01:38:39,111
I came back from India
the short way, you ninny!

1138
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,987
I take it you don't have
Phileas Fogg in that valise.

1139
01:38:48,528 --> 01:38:50,284
A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?

1140
01:39:04,145 --> 01:39:06,633
That's the last
of the coal, Captain.

1141
01:39:17,025 --> 01:39:19,359
Mr. Fogg.

1142
01:39:19,527 --> 01:39:22,429
I'm sorry to say,
we've burnt the last of the coal.

1143
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:25,183
But I've had a word with the crew,

1144
01:39:25,367 --> 01:39:27,701
and all of them...

1145
01:39:28,469 --> 01:39:30,541
have agreed to burn their shoes.

1146
01:39:31,906 --> 01:39:34,077
The effort is appreciated, Captain.

1147
01:39:34,241 --> 01:39:37,056
Unfortunately,
we've gained a mere six hours.

1148
01:39:37,845 --> 01:39:42,482
- Even shoes cannot help us now.
- Must be something we can do.

1149
01:39:51,358 --> 01:39:54,620
That's it.
I've got it.

1150
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:56,978
Birds.

1151
01:39:57,097 --> 01:39:59,486
Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!

1152
01:39:59,667 --> 01:40:01,806
No, we'll fly to London.

1153
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:05,581
We follow the laws of physics
mastered by the birds millennia ago

1154
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,615
and combine it with the Wright
Brothers' steering system.

1155
01:40:10,445 --> 01:40:12,812
Most people would laugh at you.

1156
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:16,296
But not us. We care about you.

1157
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:26,940
Captain, I'm afraid
I have to ask permission

1158
01:40:27,161 --> 01:40:29,582
to dismantle your ship
to build this machine.

1159
01:40:29,763 --> 01:40:31,836
Dismantle Carmen?

1160
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,815
But she's me livelihood,
me most loyal companion.

1161
01:40:35,035 --> 01:40:36,213
Never, never, ever!

1162
01:40:36,371 --> 01:40:39,666
What if I could direct you
to an impeccable physician

1163
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:42,908
who could replace both your nipples,
at my expense,

1164
01:40:43,143 --> 01:40:46,372
and I will give you enough money
to buy a brand-new ship?

1165
01:40:47,982 --> 01:40:50,502
You had me at the nipples.

1166
01:40:50,951 --> 01:40:54,912
- Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!
- Aye, aye, Captain!

1167
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:58,032
One, two! One, two!

1168
01:41:04,265 --> 01:41:06,175
Timber!

1169
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:40,454
I'll go sharpen the propeller.

1170
01:41:50,244 --> 01:41:51,967
Wrong way. Not looking.

1171
01:42:28,283 --> 01:42:30,225
Just one more.

1172
01:42:30,384 --> 01:42:33,067
That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!

1173
01:42:33,253 --> 01:42:37,596
The Greenwich time zone. The last time
I shall set my watch ahead.

1174
01:42:38,026 --> 01:42:40,131
Well...

1175
01:42:40,295 --> 01:42:43,142
- Shall we fly?
- Let's.

1176
01:42:43,999 --> 01:42:48,025
Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!

1177
01:42:48,302 --> 01:42:50,244
Hurrah!

1178
01:42:51,939 --> 01:42:53,826
Inspiring words.

1179
01:42:54,975 --> 01:42:58,391
- Very well. Prepare for takeoff!
- Yes, sir!

1180
01:43:12,126 --> 01:43:15,225
- Mr. Fogg, are you sure?
- No!

1181
01:43:17,097 --> 01:43:19,202
Whoa!

1182
01:43:26,341 --> 01:43:28,730
How the hell are we getting back?

1183
01:43:28,942 --> 01:43:31,692
Whoa!

1184
01:43:34,581 --> 01:43:36,850
- Now!
- Ohhh!

1185
01:43:43,757 --> 01:43:46,954
You did it, Phileas! We are flying!

1186
01:43:47,127 --> 01:43:49,778
My God! It's...

1187
01:43:50,898 --> 01:43:52,108
magical!

1188
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:55,965
- Better than your dreams?
- Better than my dreams.

1189
01:43:56,204 --> 01:43:57,960
Hey! Don't forget to steer!

1190
01:44:19,027 --> 01:44:21,394
It's a...

1191
01:44:21,563 --> 01:44:23,668
a telegram from...

1192
01:44:23,832 --> 01:44:25,839
General Fang, sir.

1193
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,128
We're going to make it!

1194
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,385
- This all right?
- Oh, dear.

1195
01:44:42,549 --> 01:44:45,997
- This is exactly like a dream I had.
- You dream of winning the race?

1196
01:44:46,253 --> 01:44:50,890
- No, of crashing to my death.
- Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.

1197
01:44:53,894 --> 01:44:56,164
- Look up there!
- Great Scott!

1198
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:58,371
Look! A flying machine!

1199
01:44:59,099 --> 01:45:02,482
- Don't step on the wing!
- It's Phileas Fogg!

1200
01:45:03,771 --> 01:45:06,967
Sir, rumor has it a flying machine
is heading for the Royal Academy,

1201
01:45:07,175 --> 01:45:09,280
our bank thief at the pedals.

1202
01:45:09,444 --> 01:45:11,997
Some people will believe anything.

1203
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,601
A flying machine is
heading for the Academy!

1204
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:18,676
- The bank thief is pedaling!
- See what I mean?

1205
01:45:18,918 --> 01:45:20,773
Help!

1206
01:45:20,921 --> 01:45:23,223
Well done, Passepartout!

1207
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:25,284
The wing ropes!

1208
01:45:26,628 --> 01:45:30,621
Just a minor setback.
Another minor setback.

1209
01:45:31,798 --> 01:45:35,475
All right, this is a major setback.

1210
01:45:36,136 --> 01:45:38,591
A flying machine is headed
for the Royal Academy,

1211
01:45:38,805 --> 01:45:41,620
and witnesses swear
that it's Phileas Fogg.

1212
01:45:43,344 --> 01:45:46,639
Faster, Passepartout! Faster!

1213
01:45:46,848 --> 01:45:49,401
- We're losing altitude!
- Landing gear?

1214
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:52,039
That would have been
an excellent idea!

1215
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:57,397
The bird men are here!

1216
01:46:00,495 --> 01:46:03,397
No. I will not lose this wager!

1217
01:46:03,597 --> 01:46:07,788
He is not to reach the top step.
Get the police. Here. Now!

1218
01:46:08,035 --> 01:46:11,166
I want Fogg arrested the moment
his feet touch British soil!

1219
01:46:11,406 --> 01:46:12,616
Oh!

1220
01:46:12,774 --> 01:46:14,628
- I'm sorry...
- Right in my ear!

1221
01:46:14,776 --> 01:46:17,645
Passepartout, get back in your seat.

1222
01:46:17,878 --> 01:46:20,660
We're going to return to the ground!

1223
01:46:26,454 --> 01:46:28,593
Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!

1224
01:46:29,389 --> 01:46:31,811
Why are they fleeing?

1225
01:46:31,992 --> 01:46:34,065
Cowards!

1226
01:46:38,832 --> 01:46:40,239
Hold on!

1227
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:13,019
Make it to the top step!

1228
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:15,915
- New Zealand. We didn't go there.
- Top step.

1229
01:47:16,136 --> 01:47:19,136
Arrest them!
They robbed the Bank of England!

1230
01:47:20,008 --> 01:47:23,204
No, no!
Nonsense! Where is your proof?

1231
01:47:23,410 --> 01:47:26,029
This is the Royal Academy of Science!

1232
01:47:26,214 --> 01:47:29,116
We don't need to prove anything!

1233
01:47:29,316 --> 01:47:32,448
Besides which,
by the time you get out of jail,

1234
01:47:32,653 --> 01:47:35,042
you'll have lost the wager.

1235
01:47:40,094 --> 01:47:41,588
Noon.

1236
01:47:41,728 --> 01:47:43,037
We did our best.

1237
01:47:44,597 --> 01:47:48,558
Out of me way! Move it!
I used to be somebody important!

1238
01:47:49,269 --> 01:47:51,473
Should have thrown him
through a higher window.

1239
01:47:51,672 --> 01:47:54,322
- Get off!
- Get rid of this buffoon!

1240
01:47:54,509 --> 01:47:58,916
That's the thanks I get for going
halfway around the world to stop Fogg?

1241
01:48:00,246 --> 01:48:04,305
He also sent a Chinese warlord
to kill Phileas Fogg!

1242
01:48:04,551 --> 01:48:06,177
That's right. He did!

1243
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:09,860
Lies! All of it!

1244
01:48:13,627 --> 01:48:14,707
- Kitchner!
- Yes?

1245
01:48:15,595 --> 01:48:18,213
- Tell them!
- Oh, well, yes, uh...

1246
01:48:18,398 --> 01:48:21,693
- Well, the thing of it...
- You mumbling moron!

1247
01:48:21,935 --> 01:48:24,204
Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.

1248
01:48:24,404 --> 01:48:27,251
I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!

1249
01:48:27,442 --> 01:48:30,376
- Rhodes!
- The thing of it is,

1250
01:48:31,144 --> 01:48:33,031
I don't want to make a fuss.

1251
01:48:33,181 --> 01:48:36,858
You spineless cretins!

1252
01:48:37,085 --> 01:48:41,689
That man stuck me with quills!
Bunches of them!

1253
01:48:41,955 --> 01:48:45,501
Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!

1254
01:48:45,759 --> 01:48:50,844
It's true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered lord.

1255
01:48:51,099 --> 01:48:54,099
- No!
- Oh, boo-hoo!

1256
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:57,400
So what if I did
try to kill Phileas Fogg?

1257
01:48:57,904 --> 01:49:01,100
What are you gutless peons
going to do about it?

1258
01:49:01,308 --> 01:49:05,018
I hold all the power!
I run everything!

1259
01:49:05,245 --> 01:49:10,363
So which of you half-wits
is going to stop me? You? You? You?

1260
01:49:10,651 --> 01:49:13,684
- The queen!
- The queen?

1261
01:49:13,888 --> 01:49:16,638
Oh, the queen!

1262
01:49:16,823 --> 01:49:20,784
That inbred, antiquated old cow!

1263
01:49:21,028 --> 01:49:25,850
The only way she could stop me
is if she sat on me!

1264
01:49:27,067 --> 01:49:30,515
With her big, fat royal bottom!

1265
01:49:34,341 --> 01:49:36,763
She's behind me, isn't she?

1266
01:49:37,544 --> 01:49:39,715
Oh, Your Majesty.

1267
01:49:39,881 --> 01:49:44,071
I have just apprehended the culprits
who robbed the Bank of England.

1268
01:49:44,318 --> 01:49:46,652
- No, Majesty!
- Rubbish!

1269
01:49:48,355 --> 01:49:50,265
Quiet!

1270
01:49:51,692 --> 01:49:54,059
I love being able to do that.

1271
01:49:54,227 --> 01:49:56,780
So, Lord Kelvin,

1272
01:49:56,963 --> 01:50:00,411
unsportsmanlike conduct,
attempted murder,

1273
01:50:00,633 --> 01:50:03,699
trading my arsenal for Buddhas.

1274
01:50:03,937 --> 01:50:06,326
How do you know about that?
I never said...

1275
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:10,730
Admit it. You've been
a naughty boy, haven't you?

1276
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:18,234
Your Majesty, I assure you,
there is an explanation for all of this.

1277
01:50:18,518 --> 01:50:20,787
What it was, was, was...

1278
01:50:20,954 --> 01:50:23,954
I was... I... I was simply...

1279
01:50:24,157 --> 01:50:25,750
simply...

1280
01:50:27,661 --> 01:50:29,385
Why do they always run?

1281
01:50:29,529 --> 01:50:30,990
Arrest him.

1282
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:35,768
Get out of my way, you fools!
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?

1283
01:50:36,904 --> 01:50:40,384
I'll kill you!
I'll have you for this, Fogg!

1284
01:50:40,641 --> 01:50:45,147
So, is this Phileas Fogg's
miraculous flying invention?

1285
01:50:46,012 --> 01:50:48,663
Your Majesty, we all invented it.

1286
01:50:48,849 --> 01:50:52,394
I'm very impressed,
and that doesn't happen often.

1287
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:53,897
Thank you.

1288
01:50:54,021 --> 01:50:57,501
But still, we failed
to help Phileas win his bet.

1289
01:50:59,326 --> 01:51:03,123
- I'm sorry, Phileas.
- Don't be, my chéri.

1290
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:07,423
I saw the world.
I learnt of new cultures.

1291
01:51:07,667 --> 01:51:09,903
I flew across an ocean.

1292
01:51:10,103 --> 01:51:11,696
I wore women's clothing.

1293
01:51:12,672 --> 01:51:14,843
Oh?

1294
01:51:15,943 --> 01:51:18,277
Made a friend.

1295
01:51:19,813 --> 01:51:22,366
Fell in love.

1296
01:51:22,549 --> 01:51:25,713
- Who cares if I lost a wager?
- I do.

1297
01:51:25,919 --> 01:51:31,549
- I've got 20 quid riding on you.
- Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.

1298
01:51:31,858 --> 01:51:35,273
Correct. Which gives you
24 hours remaining.

1299
01:51:36,163 --> 01:51:38,912
- Could we have miscounted?
- No.

1300
01:51:39,099 --> 01:51:42,841
I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour
as we passed each time zone.

1301
01:51:44,405 --> 01:51:46,794
The international date line.

1302
01:51:47,007 --> 01:51:49,855
We set our watches forward
at 20 more time zones, so...

1303
01:51:50,076 --> 01:51:52,945
here it's still day 79.

1304
01:51:53,147 --> 01:51:55,700
- So, we've...
- We've won!

1305
01:52:02,923 --> 01:52:04,385
We won, we won...

1306
01:52:04,524 --> 01:52:07,044
Thank God. Ah!

1307
01:52:11,565 --> 01:52:14,500
Your Majesty, I...
I apologize. Do forgive me.

1308
01:52:14,701 --> 01:52:18,629
- I quite forgot myself.
- Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.

1309
01:52:18,905 --> 01:52:21,840
I shall need a new minister of science.

1310
01:52:24,444 --> 01:52:28,154
Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.

1311
01:52:30,651 --> 01:52:32,920
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1312
01:52:34,054 --> 01:52:37,469
Go!

1313
01:52:42,763 --> 01:52:44,650
- We won, Phileas! We won!
- Yes!

1314
01:52:44,832 --> 01:52:46,425
We won!

1315
01:52:48,935 --> 01:52:50,877
Oh, well done!

1316
01:52:57,878 --> 01:52:59,088
Go ahead.

- But she knew I was there.That doctor, in the operating room......she looked right at me.She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.No one can see you

- They canceled it.- Who canceled it?
- Sheffield.Why are you telling me?He was busy.He was chickenshit.- Maggie, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.You're sick and you can't operate.They've rescheduled for Monday.
It's elective. No big deal.It is unprofessional and it embarrasses me
in front of my staff.I saw the chart on Balford.- What?
- I'm on the committee. It's on review.- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.Then what's the problem?I don't know.Maggie, you put up a terrific fight.Yeah.We fight for people's lives, right?Uh-huh.Don't you ever wonder
who it is we're fighting with?- So I'm crazy and I'm chemically imbalanced.
- You're tired.You have moments.Why didn't you call me?Because I never sleep
when you stay over.You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.You're good.You know it.Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.Doctor?I'll see you.<i>"... shore of the pond in my shirtsleeves..."</i><i>"... Amazon basin in the north,

- What am I, a prisoner?You wanna get well

Save the 30 grand.If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to......I'd be sucking carrots through

- What are you doing here?I was on my way up to X-Ray......and I thought I'd stop in and just......hide.From what?I should've gone into pediatrics.Oh, no.Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.Poor little guy.Yeah, okay.He never stops crying.- What's wrong with him?
- No insurance.Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.We worked him up the wazoo
for everything......from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.May I?Yeah.Did you do an ultrasound?- You hear a murmur?
- Worth a shot.Yeah.Okay, baby. Yes.So, what are you hiding from?My patient's wife.She wants me to tell her
that her husband is gonna be okay......that I have every confidence......and I don't.And after all this time,
and after all this work......I suddenly have this feeling that......none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.And if it isn't...
If it isn't, what do I do with that?Excuse me.Are you a visitor?Yes.Well, visiting hours have been over
since 8:00.Why do they have that?- What?
- Hours.Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?Who are you visiting? Mr. Messinger?Right now?Yeah.You.I don't need a visitor.You're not ill?No.I'm one of the doctors here.Are you in despair?I lost a patient.You did everything you could?I was holding his heart in my hand
when he died.Then he wasn't alone.Yes, he was.People die.Not on my table.People die when their bodies give out.It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?It wasn't your fault, Maggie.I wanted him to live.He is living.Just not the way you think.I don't believe in that.Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.How did you know my name?What's yours?Seth.Seth.You better get out of here, Seth......or Security's gonna think

âYou knew there'd always be a spring."How did you know that...?What are you talking about?
I didn't give you this book.You didn't?Where'd you get it?Hi. I'm a physician and I think
a patient left that in my office.- Can you tell me who checked it out?
- I can't tell you who.I can tell you when.- Okay.
- All right, give me 5 minutes.Hello, Maggie.It's nice to see you again.It's weird to see you again.Weird is nice.You like Hemingway?Yeah. Yeah, I'm starting to.- May I?
- Yeah."As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea......and their faint metallic taste......as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell......and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine......I lost the empty feeling......and began to be happy."He never forgets to describe
how things taste.I like that.Do you come here a lot?I live here.What do you do?Read.No, I mean, ha, ha, your work.I'm a messenger.What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?No, I'm a messenger of God.Got a message for me?I already gave it to you.Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.You've definitely been beeped.- How is Messinger?
- He's good.The operation went really well.- It was a good day.
- It was.Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.- You're an excellent doctor.
- How do you know?I have a feeling.That's pretty flimsy evidence.Close your eyes.It's just for a moment.What am I doing?You're touching me.Touch.How do you know?Because I feel it.You should trust that.You don't trust it enough.- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?I don't care.What do you want to do?Anything.What's that like?What's it taste like?Describe it. Like Hemingway.Well, it tastes like, um......a pear.You don't know what a pear tastes like?I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.Sweet......juicy.Soft on your tongue.
Grainy......like sugary sand
that dissolves in your mouth.How's that?It's perfect.The first time I looked in a microscope......that's when I knew I
wanted to be a doctor.Okay, let me have your hand.What for?We'll take a look at your blood.Not a possibility.Oh. Ha, ha. Men.I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain......is nine times higher than a man's.Okay, take a...Take a look at that.That's bright.That's me.All those cells.That's all you are.That and all the space in between.If this is all you are......these cells......then when they die, that's the end.I don't know. I think so.How do you explain it?What?The enduring myth of heaven.I used to think that I had it
all figured out.But you didn't?No.No.Because something happened.
Something happened in my OR and I got......this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something......bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it...Does that sound crazy?No.Because I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right......and I couldn't fix him.That's not supposed to happen.And I...And you cried.Yeah.- Why do people cry?
- What do you mean?I mean, what happens physically?Well, um...Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.Why? Why do they overact?I don't know.Maybe...Maybe emotion becomes so intense......your body just can't contain it.Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.Your body weeps.I have to go.I gotta go. Stay right here.Don't go anywhere.Stay right there.- Get the tube out.
- He can't breathe.It's because the tube is blocked.How you feeling?Ready to hit the waves.Well, I'm afraid your
bodysurfing days are over.You got a mean tattoo going there.What does your wife think of that?That is my wife.Okay.Check his vitals every 15.I can't see you,
but I know you're there.Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.Not yet.Where have you been?Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.Dinner?- With who?
- Well, he's a...Uh...A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.Did you pack my backpack?What else?Well, we talked......and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.Why did you pack my backpack?Earl, what are you doing?I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin......maybe do a little hiking.What?God. Is it...?Maggie, it's just a tick.- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.- We can't just be burning tick heads.
- Then get some alcohol.I don't have any.- You don't have any alcohol?
- I don't operate here.Well, how about some olive oil?Okay. All right.Which kind? Jalapefio or rosemary?Rosemary.So, what did you and your friend...?
What did you say his name was?Seth.What did you two talk about?Dying.Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?I hope you're not gonna become
one of those surgeons who prays in the OR.Can we talk for a minute?We'll talk while camping.No, Jordan, I can't go camping now.We need to spend some time together.Okay. All right, let's see if we can
just spend five minutes.Let's see if we can just stand still
for five minutes and be together.Doing what?Just being here.- I'll get the trail map.
- No. No, no.No, I mean it.Nothing but us.What am I supposed to do?Just look at me.You can't do it.You can't do it.- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.<i>That old black magic called</i><i>Love</i><i>Thank you very much.</i><i>Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.</i>You want to watch anything?Me neither.How do you know when I'm here?I know.Jeez, you look good.I forgot how good everybody looked.Thirty years of silence.You got guts, kid, showing yourself like that.
I appreciate that. I do.It's gonna make it easier.I gotta tell you, I feel fine.You might want to check your orders
because I sure don't feel like I'm dying.You're not dying.Oh, right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.Unless...Could it be......the doctor?Sure.The doctor.Oh, she's pretty.A little flat-chested......but all you need's a handful.- Who are you?
- This is good.This is what they call......"serendipitous."Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.Thank you. Thank you, okay?Okay.You ready to deal?Because I can answer
all your questions, friend.How's the French toast this evening?Fabulous.Well, set me up.Guess I should introduce myself.Come on, give me your hand.Put it in mine. There you go.A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.No, that's too much.There you go. Good grip.Nathaniel Messinger.Glutton, hedonist......former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.I don't believe you.You want proof?You hang out at a library.You can speak every language.You travel with the speed of thought.<i>And you're reading
my mind right now.</i>Stop that.You're doing it.It's impossible."Some things are true
whether you believe them or not."How?- You choose.
- Choose?To fall to Earth.You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.You just make up your mind to do it
and you do it.You wake up all smelly
and aching from head to toe......and hungrier than you've
ever been......only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff......so it's all real confusing and painful,
but very, very good.Human.Listen, kid:He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.You think he didn't give it to us too?Which gift?Free will, brother.Free will.Couldn't get a job.No past, no training.No ID.Then one day,
I was walking past a building site.A skyscraper.And I thought, "I could do that."You see, these people down here......a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?That makes me uniquely qualified.And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.And I like what I do.I'm good at it.These things'll kill you.Are there others?Others like you?Yeah, they're out there.You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.Then why'd you do it?My daughter, Ruth......her stupid husband, Frank......and my grandkids.Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.And this is my wife, Teresa.Did you......tell her who you were?I started to try once or twice.Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"Do what?It's too much for them.People don't believe in us anymore.Do they still gather together
at sunrise?And sunset, yes.Take me there?Can you hear it?No.I can't hear that!But you can't feel this!Nathan!You have to go back.Not until I catch the big wave.Wait.Wait.Wait for what?Swim!And then you just......fall.- Fall?

a kind of a welcome-home party.Are you...?Will you be going?Will you be going?This is Earl.He told me.What else does he tell you?He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.Sometimes I think Earl's
the only one who understands me.What about your boyfriend?Do you love him?Love? I don't know.What does that mean?I was hoping you could tell me.Well, it's a word......that describes a chemical react...It's just crap. I'm full of crap.I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you......and I don't even know you.What do you want to know?Why you wear the same
clothes all the time?Why won't you give me
your phone number?Are you married?No.Are you homeless?No.Are you a drummer?Why don't you ever touch me?I don't want to hurt you.You won't hurt me.Did you feel that?If I could make you understand...I understand.I'll see you around.Hey, doc!No, give me the whole package.

- Oh, yeah?Listen. Can you hear?I'm growing.Smile, Hannah.Oh, how cute.How long have you known Seth?Not very long.But I feel like I've known him forever.Honey, that hurts.You're just like Grandpa.Come on.Let's see if the cookies are done.Come on, Seth.- Can I help you?
- Yeah, great.How did you two meet?He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.I thought he was a messenger.Yeah, he's one of those......"hyphenates."I'll be right back.Seth, Seth.Hey.Here, can you cut this up?So in what province is it in Canada
were you born?I wasn't born in Canada.What are your parents' names?No parents.You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.I'm not a construction worker.Very pale hands. Let me see.- Why did you do that?
- Let me see your hand.No.What's your last name?You know my last name.No, I don't.Plate.Seth Plate?I cut you.I cut you.I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.Not the way you do.The way I do?
What does that mean?You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?The way......a human does.I have no sense of touch.You feel that?You don't have to be frightened.You freak!You liar!Who... What are you?I came to take Mr. Balford......and I saw you.I couldn't take my eyes off you.How you fought for him.And you looked right at me......like I was a man.- "To take Mr. Balford"?
- I was there.- We're always there in every room.
- What are you talking about?I was there in the stairwell......when you cried for your patient.And I touched you. Remember?Why are you doing this?Because I'm in love with you.I don't believe you.Do you feel that?You don't want to believe me.I cannot conceive of it!- Maggie.
- Just get out!Get out!Doctor?Doctor?Hello?Seth?Are you here?I wanna see you.Let me see you.Just stay.Just stay until I fall asleep.Oh, yes!Thank you.- Maggie.

- Hey.Choanal atresia.There's hardly any air getting through.How did you know?I just......knew!Maggie?Yeah.Are you alone?Yeah.Pretty intuitive call on the baby.Think so?I couldn't have done it better.Well, that's a compliment.What are you doing?I'm spending time with you.Will you marry me?We can finally get up to Tahoe.Get married on the Nevada side......honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?What do you want me to say?We belong together.We're the same species.- Jordan...
- I'm not...I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean......the proverbial heart.Please be my wife.Just...Just think about it.Breathe in.Breathe in.I'm good.I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.He didn't tell you.Tell me what?Maybe you should ask him.No, I'm asking you.Seth knows no fear......no pain......no hunger.He hears music in the sunrise.But he'd give it all up.He loves you that much.I don't understand.He can fall.He can give up his existence
as he knows it.He can give up eternity and become......one of us.It's up to you.How do you know this?Because I did it.Seth?Seth?Seth?Seth, I need to talk to you.Seth, please.Please be here.Oh, God, help me through this.You are so beautiful.You'll always be that way.Jordan asked me to go away with him......and get married.He knows me.He knows the demands of my work.You don't love him.He and I are the same.And I want that.And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.But you can feel me.You felt me.I want to say goodbye.I don't want to see you again.Yoo-hoo!Hey. Hey, buddy.You can't be in here.Do you see me?Do you see me?Can you see me?Oh, yeah.

- No.I wanted to show you everything.You will.You came all this way.I'm sorry.Oh, God, no, Maggie.To touch you......and to feel you.To be able to hold your hand right now.You know what that means?Do you know how much I love you?Keep looking at me, okay?Look right in my eyes.- Someone's out there.
- Maggie.Don't look at them.
Please, Maggie, no, don't you look at them.Is this what happens?Yes.This is what happens.I'm not afraid.When they ask me......what I liked the best......I'll tell them......it was you.God!I can't see you,
but I know you're there.I'm sorry.Get out.Seth.Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?No.Why did he do this?I don't know.Because her number was up?What do you want me to say?- Am I being punished?
- You know better than that.That's life.You're living now.And one day......you'll be dying.What's it like?What?Warmth.It's wonderful.If you'd known this
was going to happen......would you have done it?I would rather have had......one breath of her hair......one kiss of her mouth......one touch of her hand......than an eternity without it.One.[English - US - SDH]

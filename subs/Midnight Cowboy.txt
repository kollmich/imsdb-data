I mean, I understand.A dame starts cryin',
I'd cut my heart out for her.I'd call that a very minor operation.In fact, you just sit comfyand I'll cut it out

into your pocket?- Well, suppose you let me work...
- Oh, but I guess he's got that all figured out.Good night, sweets.Faggot.- [man] Provolone.
- Faggot.Look, with these gals that wanna buy it,most of them are old and dignified.Social register types.
You know what I mean?They can't be trottin' down to Times Square

You know what I mean?- [tires screech, horn honks]
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!I'm walkin' here!- Up yours, you son of a bitch!
- Get out of the way!You don't talk to me that way!

to pick up insurance.[Ratso] It's crazy, a stud like you paying that
dame that you told me about double sawbucks.You know, with proper management,you could be takin' home $50,
maybe $100 a day, easy.Hey, Brucie. Hang in there, baby.What's that?Him I placed with O'Daniel
about two weeks ago.He ain't much of a stud either,
from what I hear.All right, all right.- Hey, horse.
- [Ratso coughs]How about you take me to meet
this Mr. O'Diddleburg right now?- What do you say about that?
- Well, Joe, you're a nice guy.And I'd be doin' both of youse a favor.
But, you know, for what?What am I draggin' my bum leg
around town for, you know?Tomorrow, some peach like that is liable to be
scratching your back over there at the Plaza.And where am I gonna be, you know? Where?H-Hold on. Hold it right there.
You think I'm that kind of a son of a bitch?Well, you just name your cut.Whatever you want, you got it right now.
I swear.It's all right.What you want? Five? Ten?What, are you kidding me?
You know what? I'd "ax" somebody else.- There's ten right there.
- All right, all right. Forget it.I'll take the ten.But when I take you over

it a privilege if you'd have dinner with me.Anywhere you say. There's a little
French restaurant not too far from here.Italian restaurant? Does that appeal to you?Don't worry about how you're dressed.
They know me.Besides, I'll tell 'em you're with the rodeo.There's always a rodeo in town, damn it.Besides, you look very elegant.Oh, but damn it all, we can't do that.
I'm expecting a telephone call at the hotel.Mama? A coincidence.Guess who was being discussed.Have you got that thing turned up?Well, why aren't you wearing it?Oh, really, Mama, this is just impossible.I mean, why go to all the expense?- Why go to all the expense, Mama? The expense.

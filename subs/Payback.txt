I figure, what the hell?Now you threaten to kill me?
That much a buddy of Val's I am not.He's in the city.
That's all l know.How do you know that?-He said so.
-When?When he came. Said he squared
himself with the syndicate.Said he was back
in the big time for good.He was very excited.You tell him that Porter is back too.And he wants his money.I'll come back for you
when these kids are not around.When would l tell him this?[DlNGS][RlNGS]Talk to me. Ahem.MAN [ON PHONE]: There's a young lady

I wouldn't know her.Maybe you know somebody who would.-Why you looking for her?
-l'm her brother.I got cancer.
I want to see her.You two look close.Got a cigarette?Your sister sounds expensive.Try Michael,
bartender at the Regal Hotel.That wasn't the name
I was looking for.The only one I got.[CHUCKLES]I tried to call you, but you

How much you owe him?None of your business.I just got the feeling
he'd like to kill you.Oh, Christ!Porter.What?What'd you tell him?Nothing!-What could l tell him?
-You tell him about the money? Heroin?He had it with him!
I told him I delivered it.Nothing else?I don't know nothing else!You gave him something. A name.
Someone who knows where to find me.I swear on my mother--Fuck your mother!-That's not nice. Take it easy.

Come on, sweetheart.Meet the nastiest dog
who ever lived.What's his name?Porter.He took your job after you left.He's just as tough,
but he won't leave me. Mwah.I need a favor.A favor?Maybe you're not the same as ever.I'm looking for a syndicate boy.It's the Outfit.
We don't say "syndicate" anymore.You know what l mean.
Whatever.Don't get touchy, Porter.
What's his name?Val Resnick.That son of a bitch.You know him?I met up with him once
a few years ago.He can't use Star's service.
He beats up the girls.He almost killed one.You?Does it matter?
You quit looking after me, remember?Would you know where he might be?I suppose he's at the hotel.-Which one?
-The Outfit hotel.The address?[CHUCKLES]We're friends, right?I mean, we used to be.
But l'm an employee too.The Outfit wouldn't like me
telling you, would they?How strong are you?Personally, I think you are
the strongest man I've ever met.But l wonder if it's enough.For what?You want this guy
for something he won't like.I'm going to kill him.That's something he won't like.What if they grab you and ask you
how you found out?You know I wouldn't turn you in.-l wouldn't talk.
-What if they ask you hard?I'll say it was
a cab dispatcher named Stegman.The Oakwood Arms, Union and 1 7th.[VAL GRUNTS]Hi, Val.Where's my money?[VAL & PEARL GRUNT][DEAN MARTIN'S "AIN'T THAT

Did you hurt her?What's that have to do
with anything?[GRUNTS]I've got a few minutes.So go boil an egg.[GRUNTS]Phillip says you have a problem
you need help with.VAL:
Yes, sir.Is it your problem. . .. ..who breached our security
last night?Yes, sir. Ahem.He breaks into my apartment--There's an old expression
that has served me well:"Do not shit where you eat."Or "live.""Do not shit where you live."I like that better.I'm sorry, Mr. Carter.There are three ways
we can handle this.One: We help you.
Two: We allow you to help yourself.Three: We have you replaced.We have an investment in you, Resnick,
of time, money and training.So assisting you would be. . .. ..in a way, protecting our investment.And that is always
good business policy.Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.Thank you.
You won't regret it.According to Phillip,
a man has come to town to kill you?Yes, sir.You say he's alone and that, uh,
he's a professional robber. Correct?Yes, sir. He does, uh, payroll jobs,
banks, stuff like that.CARTER:
Hmm.-What's his name?
-Porter.What's his first name?Uh, I don't know. He never called
himself anything but Porter. Ha, ha.Oh.Where did you get the $1 30,000?That's why this man
has come to town, huh?The $1 30,000 you paid us back.Uh, yes, sir.
But only $70,000 of it was his.We never asked you where you got it.
It's none of our business.Now it appears
it has become our business.[PH lL CLEARS THROAT]PH lL:
Here's his file, Mr. Carter.Do you understand your value
to the organization?You're a sadist, you lack compunction.
That comes in handy.But now, an area of your personal life
has become a danger to us.A man in our organization needs
to be tough, self-reliant.Were you to handle this problem
on your own. . .. ..there would be no doubt.... ..you're the kind of man we want.I want to. Ahem.I want to handle it myself.Great.Until it is handled, l want you
to move out of the Oakwood Arms.Uh, ahem, but l don't have a place, uh--I don't want any more
unpleasantness at the hotel.Yes, sir.[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]Excuse me, but it might be easier
if Resnick just disappeared.I thought about that.But l'm not worried about Resnick.He wouldn't last two minutes
on the street without us.It's that other mutt
I'm thinking about.-What's his name?
-Porter.Takes a lot of moxie to walk into
the Outfit and whack our guys around.Either that or he's shit nuts.Frankly, I don't understand it
for $1 30,000.It was $70,000, his share.That's even worse.I don't want
Mr. Bronson hearing about this.He'll think l'm getting soft.His principle has always been:"If you don't understand it,
get rid of it."A stitch in time, so to speak.Stitch this mutt up, Phil.Any Polaroids or trophies?No, not this time.[PHONE RlNGING]MAN: Aah!

I'm coming to get you.BRONSON:

Damn shame, Porter.But don't let the bastards
get you down. Ha, ha.That's right. Don't give up.Can l have my piece?Oh, yeah.[SIGHS]LEARY:

will they?No.[SCOFFS]I'm sorry.I'm sorry I got you involved.So why did you?You're a clever guy.
You didn't need me.So why did you?Yeah, you're right.When I came back,
I came back here with nothing.No life. No hope.You were the only good thing
that hadn't been taken.I couldn't stay away.I had to see you to make sure
I wasn't in hell.So why don't we get out of here?-We can't.

Call Mr. Bronson.See what we can do
about getting my money back.[SIGHS]He let Carter die.That poor bastard's
better off dead anyway.[CHUCKLES]He'd probably let me die too.With Carter,
he thought l was bluffing.Try him. He might be more
receptive than you think.All right.You two are fired.Hello? Well, it's like this.I'm in my living room.
There's a man named Porter.... ..who says that
he, uh, expects you to pay him.Of course.He wants to talk to you.Put it on the speaker.[MEN GROAN lNG]-This is Porter.

in the ass. A mosquito.To get rid of you,
I'll swat you with 1 30 grand.[SCOFFS]It's not a hund---What the hell are you doing?
BRONSON: Fairfax?It's all right. He's just
killing my alligator bags.. .. ..and shooting holes in my suits.That's mean, man!You aren't listening.
It's not 1 30--BRONSON:
No, you listen.You'll get your money,
but you'll never live to enjoy it.PORTER:
You let me worry about that.I want you to deliver
the money yourself.You're one hell of an optimist.What makes you think
I'll deliver it myself?If you don't,
you'll never see Johnny again.Didn't come home last night, did he?He's a good-looking kid,
but you indulge him too much.I told him so.Bullshit. You haven't got him.-You're not that stupid.
-My dad never bought me a Ferrari.I had to steal my first one.Nice inscription on the key chain.A little sappy.
Want me to read it?You're dead.
Nobody fucks with my family.You hear me?You're a dead man.That's Johnny, unless you
turn up with the money.Is that a yes? Hmm?What? Cat got your crotch?Some decisions are hard, Mr. Bronson.Where?I'll let you know.I'l l be in touch.[LINE BUZZING][SIGHS][HANGS UP PHONE]You just signed your own
death warrant for $1 30,000.I don't get that. What is it?The principle or something, huh?Stop it, l'm getting misty.

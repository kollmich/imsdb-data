across the border, man.- Hey, what are we smuggling?
- Upholstery, man.He's got an upholstery shop
in Beverly Hills,but he gets all the work done here, man,
'cause it's cheaper.<i>The smuggling of marijuana
from Mexico into the United States</i><i>has reached a dangerous high.</i><i>The methods have become
unbelievably devious,</i>and these are the seeds which may sow
the destruction of the human race.Gentlemen, I don't think
we need to commenton the seriousness of the situation.Harry, will you cool that?
Just stop that, Harry.Gentlemen, we are on the thresholdof copping one of the largest shipments
of marijuanathat has ever crossed
the Mexican borderinto the United States.The question is, how are they going
to transport it across the border?- By boat.
- Carrier pigeon.- Plane.
- Freight.Piggyback.- Plaster casts.
- Long trucks.Long trucks.Let me show you.Inside TV sets.No, Harry. No, no, no.
Not inside TV sets.The TV set itself is the marijuana.The tube, the picture,
the aerial, the whole works.How can you make a TV set
out of marijuana?That's a good question, Harry.
I'll show you.Now, the weed is separated from seed.The weed is then
transformed into liquid.The liquid is then
acted upon by a chemicalwhich makes it hard like a plastic.The plastic is then
transformed into a spray.This spray, gentlemen,
is called fiberweed,and it's pure marijuana.Thanks to the efforts
of our undercover maninside the dope factory,
we have some very interesting facts.Now, that is quite a quantity
of marijuana, gentlemen.It is not a lid, it is not a kilo,
it is not a gram.Just how much do you think
is in this dope factory?A million pounds.- Harry?
- A shitload.Harry.What we do know
is that the dope factory is disguised<i>as an upholstery warehouse.</i>Hey, this is the street, man. Come on.- How can you eat this stuff, man?
- I love them. Don't you like these?I told you not to buy it, man. God.What did you do that for, man?
I would have ate it.You never know what's in that stuff,
man. Could be a dog or something.- You got the address?
- Good dog, man.Hey!- Son of a...
-181...Is that seven or a one? It looks seven.
Come on. Let's go check this place out.Hey, we're here to pick up the van, man.We're here to pick up the van.Have a seat.
The boss will be right back.Okay. The boss will be right back, man.

one of them burritos, too, man?Supposed to eat
a little bit of ice cream with it.Come on, ice cream.Even though we do not know
what we are looking for,we do know the approximate value
of the weed itself.Gentlemen, I would like
to hear your opinions.A million?The television set alone
is worth close to a million.- A billion dollars.
- Now we're getting somewhere.I'm freezing at 200 million.- Sarge, I think it's four billion.
- You're all wrong.Nine billion big ones, boys.And you know what that means.The better the bust,- the bigger the boost.
- The bigger the boost.Excellent.Well, I guess that about wraps it up.Any questions?Where'd you learn how to
roll them big joints, man?Hey, you like that, man?They're heavy.Yeah, I used to be a roadie
for the Doobie Brothers, you know.What a groovy gig.Yeah. That's how
I learned to play drums.- Oh, yeah?
- Beating on the drums.Hey, I dig Mexico, man.I'd like to come back here
when we got more time.Oh, man, are we at the border already?Looks that way, man.Oh, shit.
Hey, man, well, get rid of the stuff, man.- Oh, yeah. Better get rid of this shit.
- Yeah, hurry up.Man, just put it down, man.
Get rid of it, man. Oh, shit.We're at the border, man.Shit.Lookit.Hey, get rid of it. Not that way, man.
Throw it out.Throw it out.This is Toyota Kawasaki,here at
the Mexican-United States border,where a huge task force
of narcotic and customs agentsis preparing a surprise welcomefor a vehicle
which they say is constructedentirely of high-grade marijuana.Don't make that face, man.
You make me laugh.Just let me do all the talking, man.
I got it.- Good afternoon, sisters.
- Good afternoon, Officer.How long have you been in Mexico?Okay. Just be cool.How long have you guys
been in Mexico?A week. I mean, a day.Which one is it, a week or a day?A weekday.You got any narcotics
or marijuana in here?Not anymore.You guys better step out of that van.- A fire.
- Oh, Sister, a fire.- I'm on fire.
- What is it?Hey, this looks like a bust. Hey.Get Stedenko on the phone right away.
This might be it.Hey, come on.
What have we got here, Sister?Hey, they're busting nuns, man.- Wow. That's cold-blooded.
- Hey, let's watch, okay?Okay. Up against the wall. All of you.Let's get up against the wall.Sergeant Stedenko,
exactly what are you looking for?Dope, drugs, weed, grass,
toot, smack, quackers,uppers, downers, all-arounders.
You name it, we want it.And how important is it to you
to apprehend the suspects?Critical.The buying and selling of dope
in this countrymay be the last vestige
of free enterprise left.There's rumor, Sergeant,that the suspects might be
armed and dangerous.Do you expect to see any violence
here today?I certainly hope so.Sergeant, have you yourself
smoked marijuana?Only once.Hey, look, we're on TV, man.- Sergeant, telephone.
- Hi, Mom.- Sounds heavy.
- This could be it.- Why are the cops around here?
- Hey, well, let's find out, man.Yeah. Hey, listen, I got to go pee first.Okay. Don't go scuba diving.So it was a station wagon, huh, Harry?Very devious.They almost look like real nuns,
don't they, Harry?Right down to the stockings.Very clever. Very clever.Not bad.You ought to be ashamed
of yourself, you know that?Reminds me of a funny story
my dad used to tell me, Harry.The only kind of meat
a priest could eat on Friday was nun.Inside!Harry, get a sample of that car.Yes, Sergeant.Start the interrogation, Murphy.
I'll be right back.Hey, what's going on out there, man?Excuse me. What's going on out there?Don't worry about it, buddy. It's nothing.Just some people doing what they're
not supposed to be doing. That's all.Son of a bitch. Look at the...Some asshole pissed on my leg.Listen, our agent
just phoned from Mexico.It's not a bunch of nuns
in a station wagon.It's two hippies in a green van.Must be some heavy shit.Let's go. Come on.Get that siren up!Where would
these two creeps hang out?Where do hippies hang out today?Sunset Strip.
That's where they hang out.Yeah, we could try there.If they're not there,
we can go up to San Francisco.Imagine the field day
those two creeps are gonna havewhen they find out
that van is made of grass, huh?I don't believe it.
I really don't believe it.You guys are supreme idiots.I mean, how could you
let a big, green vanslip right through your fingers?Spend one week at the border,
and what do we end up with?Busting a bevy of nuns,
a guy pisses on my leg,and I lose my special canine sentry dog.Best cop I ever knew.- See anything?
- Negative.Well, use mine. They're on the floor.Oh, yeah. These are great, Sergeant.
You can see everything.What do you see?You know,
there's a great donut shop up there.- Do you think we have time...
- No, no. I mean on the road.Wait a minute. There's the van.
There's the van.Yeah, that's it.Hey, listen, man,
when we get back to town,let's really get serious
about this group, okay?Yeah, really, man.Like, if we practice all the time,
rehearse, man,we could have a heavy band.Let's not let anything interfere
with our music this time.Yeah, that's right.
Hey, you see what I see, man?Yeah. Hey, they're hitchhiking, man.All right.There they go, Harry.
Keep your eye on them.Wonder what
they're doing way out here?I don't know, but here comes
the Mounties to the rescue.Holy...Turn around, Harry. They're over there.Keep your eye on them, Harry.
Keep your eye on them.Hey, man, you know how to drive, man?- Sort of. Why?
- Take over, man.Hey, what are you doing, man?- Hi, ladies.
- Hey.- Hey, apr√®s-vous, all of you.
- Thanks.There you go. Watch your step.I'll watch everything else.Hey, what's happening?- How far are you going, man?
- All the way.All right. We're going there ourselves.
Come on over.- There they go, Harry. There they go.
- I see them. I see them.- Shoot their tires out.
- Got it.- No, not yours. Use my gun.
- Thanks, Sarge.Oh, my God.Damn it. You stupid idiot.
Look, you idiot.You are a stupid, stupid man.
Get over here, Harry.Get over here. Give me that gun.When I think of the time and the money
I've wasted on your training,and you still turn out to be
a blithering idiot.You're an utter failure.
You make me sick!Have you anything to say for yourself?
In the car!God, I will never, ever, nevertake a bald-headed man
in the department again.Wow. This is a neat van.Yeah. Want to see the rest of it?- Okay. Sure.
- Yeah?Oh, hey. We'll go right back there.
The rest of it is right back there.Go ahead. Hey, watch your step.
Yeah. There you go.Yeah, right back there.Hey, have fun at Magic Mountains.Oh, yeah. I see London, I see France.If I ain't out in three weeks, man,

We're friends, partners.We're not partners

we'll be known as...X-Force.Isn't that
a little derivative?I don't recall asking

Oh, but Paul!DOMINO: Peter!Peter, I'm gonna
miss him most.But there is
a slight chanceVanisher could make it.[PEOPLE EXCLAIMING]
Nope, no chance. He's dead.DOMINO:

a Juggernaut thing to say.[DEADPOOL SCREAMING]Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.I can't feel...Oh, no, they're right here.Got 'em.
God, Russell.I have a mission.To get my revenge.I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.You're not the revenge type.Take it from a friend.Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.You said it yourself."I'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."So I did.[GRUNTS]Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,I care about you, Russell.What's Juggernaut got

cover that up?A warrior has nothing

Look at you.You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,toddler-style.Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.The hell's happening?
Describe it.I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.WEASEL: It's like, um... Here we go.It's like he was
giving birth anally,but they quit halfway through.They got the legs out,
and they said,"You know what, I'm done."Happy?It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.But this time, you can seethe Muppet's dick. [DOOR OPENS]Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.DOPINDER: Mr. Weasel, I can

take my hearing?Oh. Wow!Cool your pits.
They're growing back.I'm talking about your face.I've never seen you
without your mask before.Jesus Christ! Looks like an avocado.DOMINO: Your legs, though,
they're cute.You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?I'm glad everybody dropped by.You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.I'll tell you why I'm here."The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband...beat me within
an inch of my life.He was torturing me!But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.So, I'm here
to help us gear up.So we can go after him
without me.WADE: No!I'm doing this alone.The Juggernautwill kill you all. Fair enough.WADE: I just need a couple of
hours to get some legsunder me. What will you do?WADE: I don't care
what the kid did to me.I ain't letting Cable
get to him,even if I have to
teabag him to death.It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.The first order
of business isto get me in front of Cable...so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?[COCKS GUN]What in the ass?Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.Ugh. Is that really necessary?No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."What can we help you with?I'm here to proposition you.[LAUGHS] Oh, boy!He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?Who gets to make
the first joke?I think we should all do it
at the same time.Good call.For $45, you get sucky-suck.BOTH: I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.Fuck!The Proposition
has a wonderfulGuy Pearce performance.WADE: Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.Give us the line again. I need your help!Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!I can't bring him down alone.So here we are.We're no longer
accepting applicationsfor X-Force, unfortunately.Even if we were...there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...We don't have a lot of time.Your friend's about
to make his first kill.No offense,
but if you know so much...why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?Or better yet, head back
a little further,kill baby Hitler.I use a device
to slide through time.The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.I got two charges:
one to get me here,one to get me home.Well.That's just lazy writing.Your boy's
gonna kill the headmasterof the orphanage tonight.After that,
he gets a real taste for it.Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!So he keeps killing...and killing, and killing,and killing. [GUNS COCKING]Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.My people.Relax.I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.It's a goddamn fanny pack...and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!The difference
is night and day.You remind me of my wife.I'm sorry.I said, "You remind me
of my wife."No, I'm sorry
that you said that...while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.CABLE: She always struggled.But she was funny...and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.Something I could
never master.It was my fault she died.It was my job
to stop people like him.I came close a few times. [TOMORROWPLAYING]He wasn't too happy
about that.He was trying to hurt me...and he knew exactly
how to do it.OLDER RUSSELL:
Blessed are the wickedwho are healed by my hand.CABLE: He came into my home...and took the only thing
that made it a home.Sound familiar?I'm sorry.Uh-huh.No, I'm really sorry.But that isn't Russell.It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...Yeah, he's got anger issues...maybe a small
learning disability...splash of diabetes...but nothing
that can't be fixed.If you could go back...and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?No.I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.Of course I fucking would!But I wouldn't kill a kid.I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!I'll kill the kid.I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?Give me a chance to save him.What? You said...once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.If we can get to him
before that happens...promise you'll give me
a chanceto put him
on a different path.Define "chance."I don't know.
How long does it taketo save someone's soul?
That's not...I'll give you 30 seconds.What? No! Best I can do.Take it or leave it.[CABLE GROANS]WEASEL: He's doing it!Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.[RETCHES] There he goes.CABLE: Jesus Christ!WEASEL: Just shirt-cocking it.Ugh.WEASEL:
There you go, little fella.Go on, you're doing it!My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.DOMINO: Christ!That's disturbing.30 seconds.Deal.Deal.[FARTING ]Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.I really wanted to match,
you know?Being a menacing team. [PEOPLE SCREAMING]Oh, man, it sucks.That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.DEADPOOL: And that is just
the first five stepsto a prostate-assisted orgasm.Where the hell
are we going?DEADPOOL:
You said it yourself.Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.[BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PLAYING

in an Indian accent?I'm sorry? Apology accepted.This is a side of you
I do not like.Let me guess,some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.What the hell are you...?Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.I am so sorry.
It gets better.I'm not a fucking racist,
moron!That's precisely
what a racist would say.I'm with the old white guy
on this one.And that's a twist.When this is over...I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.I should have
finished college.DEADPOOL:
So what exactly do youdo in the future, anyway, huh?Some kind of soldier?Yeah, something like that.DEADPOOL: I was a soldier.
Special Forces.I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.50 years from now,
you're very dead.Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.Boom! [IMITATES EXPLOSION]Spoiler alert.[SNICKERS][SIGHS] Planets.Next time, Uber.Here's a spoiler alert.You're not a fucking hero.You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.DEADPOOL:
Well, I got news for you.My heart
is in the right place.Russell's not
gonna kill anyone.Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.We're all going to die.Because of you,
I'll always knowwhat a grown man
with baby balls looks like.I'm a grower, not a shower.God, I wish this were a buswhere I could pull
the string and get out.It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,or you'd be in the back.I am in the back.
DEADPOOL: Right here![BRAKES SCREECHING][IN YOUR EYESPLAYING
ON BOOM BOX][GROANS]DEADPOOL: I made mistakes!I wanna take them back!You trusted me.
I took that trust...and turned it
into a glory holein an airport bathroom.The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.I was once an X-Man.Trainee![MUSIC STOPS]You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.They do stick better
than tape.Hi, Wade!Please don't.Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.Right. Quick.It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.And just like me,he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...because the whole world
wrote him offas a piece of shit
a long time ago.Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut![GASPS] The Juggernaut!Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...so I'm saying hi back.You guys make
a super cute couple.Yeah. Where was I?Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...and causes nothing
but problems!Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?I would be disgraced.You are a criminal,
a fugitive.But worst of all...you broke my heart, Wade.Then you know what?Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!So stay here
in Chateau de Virgin...while we go get our fuck on!DOMINO: You're doing great.[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
[ENGINE STARTS]RUSSELL: So you wear
that helmet becauseyour brother

I've got the old man.Amen, brother.[BRAKES SCREECHING]Time to make the chimichangas.30 seconds.I finally know why I'm here.I was raised in this place.Well, not raised.
I was tortured.Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.Shall we? This is gonna be fun.DEADPOOL: Yeah!Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.Give me some.They say
laughter heals anything...except, of course, that.We should just cue the music.[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.Russell!You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?[YELLING]That's why!Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...[GROANS]
JUGGERNAUT: Hey!I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.My body and my hands
are so soft.You should probably
head back to the car.I think I'll head
back to the car.It works best
when you pull the trigger.[GROANS]That gun is amazing!RUSSELL: Say it!You are an abomination![GRUNTS]Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.I believe him!
Every man for themselves!Gotcha!JUGGERNAUT: Beat it, midget!Hey, big guy,

shove it up your ass.[METAL CLANGS][GROANS]That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!Oh, great!ORDERLY: There they are!
Those freaks!DEADPOOL: A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.Can I have
one of those guns?No.That's fine.Get off this property,
mutant scum!I'm just gonna
use this brick.Maximum effort.[BOTH GRUNTING]Who says you
can't go home again?[ALL GRUNTING][SCREAMS]

You're doing amazing.[GROWLS]Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!Go home, Wade!You're ruining everything!I'm getting good at this shit.DEADPOOL: Go, go, go![GRUNTS]He dies tonight, Wade.You can't stop me!CABLE: He even runs
like a fucking pervert.Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.There's one bullet left
in that gun.Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!I got this.Russell! Stay back! Go home, Wade!Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!That piece of shit...he deserves to die
for what he did to you.He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.But if you kill him, he wins.You become everything
he says you are, but worse.You're just a kid.You don't wanna hurt anyone.How do you know what I want?Because I've been inside you.That came out wrong.I've been inside your shoes.Which is also off-putting.It's not a great analogy.The point is...there are people...There are people
in this fucking world...besides him,
who will treat you right.It isn't too late.
Don't do it.I never should've left
you there.I never should've left you
in that prison.I can't trust you.I can't trust anybody![GROANING]Wonderful kid.RUSSELL:
You can't stop me, Wade![DEADPOOL GROANS]I got one more idea.It's just a really bad one,
even for me.Wade, what are you doing?All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!You're gonna kill
someone today...Blessed are the wicked......then it's gotta be me....who are healed by my hand![MOUTHS] Fuck this![TOMORROWPLAYING][GIRL SINGING][GROANS]Tell me they got that

for me.Yeah.And it was the best thing
I ever did.[COUGHING]I told you
I care about you.You're a good kid, Russell.Hey.The bear.It worked.Because of you.No, Wade, because of you.Stop, stop, stop!Stop!Just let it happen, okay?I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.[GROANS] That riddle
is so fucked up.[GROANS, COUGHS]I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.Don't be. Don't be.I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.Please, just don't leave me.I don't wanna die
without an audience.We are not going anywhere.WADE: Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.Just rest, okay?Papa.âª Papa, can you hear me? âªâª Papa, can you find me
in the night? âªBefore I go... [COUGHS]Sorry, I got a bit more in me.Domino.I want you to have
my Adventure Timewatch.[WADE COUGHING]Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.Thank you.Hey, Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch.I liked you better
with your hair short.Think everyone did.Hi, Yukio. Hi, Wade![CHUCKLES]And you...Chrome Bone.I haven't always been
the best friend to you.But you've always been
that to me.So thank you.Say "fuck" for me.Just once. Come on,we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...Fuck.Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.
[CHUCKLES]And you, Cable. [COUGHS]You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.And promise me.
Promise me one thing.That you'll start
judging people...not by the color
of their skin,but by the content
of their character.Jesus.
WADE: R-Dog?There you are. Hey!You're a superhero now, bubba.That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.This one is yours.You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.Especially around the pants.And let it out
a little in the waist.But, hey.Look.Family is not an F-word.All right?There's one out there
for you. [COUGHS]Just keep looking, okay?Guys, for a second there...we made a pretty good team.[SIGHS]Oh, it's so hard to go.[WHINES]I just love being around
you guys so much.So, so much.Mmm.No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.I feel the soul
exiting the husk.Yeah.Can you see it?Do you see
that beautiful bright light?There it is.Oh, that's the sun.Don't stare
directly into that.I just have a few final words.[EXHALES]Woodpecker.Gingivitis.Codswallop.Do You Want to
Build a Snowman?[MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING]Sorry I'm late.There was a bunchof handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.No.No.But I did have to help a kid.Yeah.He's got a terrible name. It's just awful.Ugh. I tried to tell him.Is this heaven?It is now.I am so sorry.VANESSA: It's okay.I missed you so much.What is it? What's wrong?It's not time.What do you mean
it's not time?I'm here, I made it.You can't stay. No, no, no.I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.It's okay.There's a time for us.
It's just not now.They need you. Who?VANESSA: Your F-word.WADE: Why?VANESSA: You'll find out.It's all right. I'll be here.It's pretty fucking
awesome over here.I can have anything I want.Can every day be
International Women's Day?It is heaven.I love you.I know. I love you, too.Now, go.Go on. Go, get out of here.Go.Hey!Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.Well, come here.Don't fuck Elvis.Ooh, too late. I'm sorry?[SCREAMING]Time to make the chimichangas.30 seconds.Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?It's my daughter's teddy bear.Her name's Hope.DEADPOOL: Well...What are you doing?Somebody swiped right.[FAST-FORWARDING][GROANS]Tell me they got that
in slow motion.[DEADPOOL GROANS]RUSSELL: You sacrificed
yourself for me.DEADPOOL: It would seem I...Huh?Genuine, high-grade lead.You time-sliding
son of a bitch!You did this for me?Wait. You can't go back.You used
the last of your fuel.What about your girl,
your wife?Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...and make sure the worlddoesn't shit itself
into oblivion.No. You did it for me.No, I didn't.You did. I really didn't.Pretty sure you did.
No, I'm positive I didn't.Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.Say it again.He did it for me.
CABLE: Jesus.We must get the collar off.
Forget it. It's no use.These collars
don't just come off.Wade.I have an idea.No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!I'd rather die of cancer.

like that never happened.Let's go home, Russell.All you dirty mutantsare gonna rot in hell
with the boy!Your souls
are beyond redemption!Let's see your soul, perv!No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!We're better than him!No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!We'll let karma
take care of him.The day of reckoning is here![TIRES SCREECHING][CRASHING]I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.Whoo!Courage, motherfuckers!And karma, motherfucker.DEADPOOL: I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.I could barely keep
a straight face. [LAUGHS]I want some more.I bet you do, Brown Panther.We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.Good call.
You guys coming with us?No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.Besides, we're X-Men.No, you're X-People.You're exhausting.I see what you did there.

I'm not ready to date again.Let alone two women.God, you're a douche.Bye, Wade! Bye, Yukio![WE BELONGPLAYING]DEADPOOL: What do you getwhen you take
eight feet of chrome...one pinch of courage...a cup of good luck...a dab of racism...a splash of diabetes...and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?Answer: a family.See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.If there's anything
you take away today...other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...it's that we all need
to belong to someone.How something
so small generatesenough energy
to reverse time is...Oh, just fix it, Eleven,or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.Never heard of him.Why do you think
I'm helping him?The Lord works
in mysterious ways,don't I? A good day.Bye, Wade!Bye, Yukio!That was probably a bad idea.What have we done?[IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME

our kid Cher!Whoo!DEADPOOL: Peter!Whoo! X-Force!Walk away! Just walk away!But we're X-Force! Nope! We're not.X-Force is just

this has been pretty scary!And I need to feed my cat!Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?Wade, is that you?I guess Stryker finallyfigured out
how to shut you up.[GUNSHOT]Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!Just cleaning up
the timelines!Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.Huh?But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...to get back
in the saddle again.And when he does,
say yes.Oh, right.

take care of that, won't we?Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.Oh, I'm going to hell.That makes two of us.You can do this.

such a little bastard.No one's ever changed you.Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...which would makes sense,

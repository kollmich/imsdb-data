<i>Now, where to begin?</i><i>How 'bout, "Once upon a time"?</i><i>How many times have you heard</i>

<i>I got it, I got it,</i><i>here we go.</i>
<i>Here's how to open a movie!</i><i>No, I don't think so.</i>
<i>It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?</i><i>Oh, no, no, not the book.</i><i>How many have seen</i>
<i>"opening the book" before?</i><i>- Close the book. We're not doing that.</i><i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i><i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i><i>Why don't I just go back to the day</i><i>things took a turn for the worse?</i>Run for your lives!

What is it? What's going on?The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!- The sky is falling?
- Are you crazy?No, no, no!
It's true! Come with me!No. Son? What?It happened under the old oak tree!I'm not making this up. It's here.There's a piece
of the sky somewhere......somewhere on the ground.It was shaped like that!- It looks like a stop sign?
- Yes!Only it doesn't say "stop"
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.And it hit me on the head!- It looked like a stop sign.
- Wait! What's that?- Son, is this what hit you?
- What?Oh, no, Dad. It was
definitely a piece of the sky!Piece of the sky. It's OK, everyone!- Dad, no.
- There's been, like, a little mistake.It was just an acorn that-that
hit my son. A little acorn.- No! Dad, no.
- Quiet, son.This is embarrassing enough already.Chicken Little! What were you thinkin'?Why put your town's safety in jeopardy?How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?- But it... a big acorn level fluh.
- What did he say?- A big acorn level fluh...
- It was a big acorn?- An ape throwing coleslaw?
- A big acorn level fluh...Gesundheit!Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,- gibberish of an insane person.
- Come on, Buck!Your kid went
and scared us all half to death!Well, what can I tell you,
folks, my son,you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. It's...No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn.It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.You gotta believe me.A movie. A movie.They're makin' a movie.When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,then the book on tape,
then the board game,the spoons with your face on it......and the Web site,
the commemorative plates....and the Web site,
the commemorative plates.- You saw them, right?
- Yeah. I saw them.Can't eat off 'em.- They're not microwave-safe.
- You saw the billboards?I saw them.Ha! There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.It doesn't matter. You know why?
Because I've got a plan.Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told youit would be better for you to lay low,don't call attention to yourself?- Yes, but I...
- See, it's like a game.Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek,except the goal
is never to be found, ever!Great!Now, we've got a plan, right?I'll see ya later! Remember, lay low.Yeah. OK.Bye.Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken!Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so
smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!That's it. Today is a new day.How's it going?Ahem.- Very well. Foxy Loxy.
- Present, pretty, punctual.Goosey Loosey.Master Runt of the Litter.Present and accounted for,
Mr. Woolensworth.Oop! Dropped my pencil!Whoa! Ahh!- Loser!
- Henny Penny.- Here.
- Ducky Lucky.- Here.
- Fuzzy Wuzzy.- Here.
- Morkubine Porcupine.- Yo.
- Fish Out of Water.Quite. Abby Mallard.Ugly duckling.Class! I will not tolerate rude behavior- at the expense of a fellow...
- No worries, Mr. Woolensworth.Yah!You mustn't sneak up on me,
Ugly... uh, Abby.- Where was I?
- Ugly duckling.Oh, yes.Chicken Little.Hmm.- Tardy again.
- Tardy again. Hmm.Class, turn to page 62
and translate each word in Mutton.- He.
- Baa.- She.
- Baa.- They.
- Baa.- We.
- Baa.OK, everyone. Listen up!OK, everyone. Listen up!I don't wanna hear any quacks,
tweets, oinks, whinniesor cocklee-doodle-doos
when I say... dodgeball.Oh, man.Pump it up! Pump it, pump it, pump it!Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.- Coach?
- Yeah, unpopular?Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?Sure! Hit the pig, kids!Aaah!Look out!Calm down, Runt. Just...Just do what Fish is doing.Whew!- Tough morning?
- A run-in with my old nemesis.- Gum in the crosswalk?
- He won this round.- Your old foe!
- Mm-hmm.- Incoming on your right.
- Thank you!Aah!Yeah, I heard about
the movie. Tough break.- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll just go straight to video.That's the least of my problems.This morning... this morning my dad
told me I should basically disappear.But that's not gonna get me down.I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?- Uh-oh.
- No, no, no! This one's good.Look, one moment destroyed
my life, right? One moment.- Warthog at 3:00!
- I see him!- Yes!
- So I figure all I need is a chance...All I need is a chance
to do something greatto make everyone forget the
"sky falling" thing once and for all.And then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.Time out!Nurse!- Hi, Tiffany!
- Hey, man, what's goin' on?So, what do you think?OK, listen.You said the sky was falling.- Your dad didn't support you.
- I...And you have been hurting
inside ever since, right?- It's hurt. It stung. OK?
- It's hurt, but... Yes.- That's the nutshell.
- OK. Yes, but...- No. Buh-buh...
- But, it's...What's got to happen now
is the nut needs to be cracked open.And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!Denial! Fear!
Deep depression, in fact!You see what I'm saying?Uh...All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.- OK, yes, but...
- Here's the real solution.You and your dad
talk-talk-talking... closure!- Closure?
- Closure,talking about something
until it's resolved.Wait! Hold on! See? Look.There's a whole section about it
in this month's <i>Modern Mallard.</i>- Incredibly appropriate!
- I told you, I have a plan.Yeah, but according to <i>Cosmo Duck,</i>you should
"stop the squawk and try the talk."<i>Beautiful Duckling</i> says,"Avoiding closure with your parents
can cause early molting."See? Closure.Repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...Abby, listen! Talking's a waste of time.I got to do something great so my dad
doesn't think I'm such a loser.Come on. You are not a loser.You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...What?Yeah... uh, Runt!Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the airor keep searching for Band-Aid solutions
and never deal with the problem?Band-Aid solutions!- Runt!
- Well, I'm sorry!I'm very bad at reading facial cues.Fish, help me out here.Men.'T was beauty that killed the beast.I guess only girls are good at
honest communication and sensitivity.That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!Prepare to hurt.
And I don't mean emotionally, like I do.Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!Whoa!We will save you!Fall back! Mad goose!Chicken Little!Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?Ever since that "sky falling" incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!Now look, Buck.You know I have
the utmost respect for you.I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck,our school baseball star.But let's face the facts.Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.OK.Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.I... Dad, it wasn't my fault.- It was Foxy. She's always...
- All right. It's fine.You don't have to explain anything.Uh...Uh... Hey, Dad?I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I?What if?What if I joined the baseball team?Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.Baseball? Son, we talked about this.Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when I was small.I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.Really, son? Baseball. Are you sure?Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad,you were such a big
baseball star in high school.You could give me some pointers.But, son, you know,
I'm just wondering...Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?Have you considered
the chess team or the glee club?And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.- No.
- Wanna stop? We'll get some stamps.- I don't like stamps.
- Colors, colorful things...No, I was thinkin' baseball!I can't wait to see
the look on your facewhen I smack that ball in
for a touchdown!Dad... Um, I'm kidding.That was a... that was a joke.Just do me one favor, son.Why, sure, Dad. Anything.Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...I mean, I think I can...I...OK, Dad.Oh, Chloe. If only you were here.You'd know what to do.- That's my boy!
- Gee, thanks, Dad!Come on. All I need is a chance.<i>Lean to the left</i>
<i>Lean to the right</i><i>C'mon Acorns</i>
<i>Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!</i>There's excitement
in the air, ladies and gentlemen.It's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivalsthe Spud Valley Taters.Down by only a single run,
and with a player in scoring position,we finally have a chance again.This excitement isn't about the fun
of baseball, it's not about the prize.It's about gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,the "Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!" taunting, if you will,- that comes with the winning.
- Yeah!That's right. Oakey Oaks
and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkeywill finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!But this battle has taken
a heavy toll on our hometown heroes.After nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries,the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.Up next... Chicken Little.Clearly a long shot, folks.Little hasn't been up to bat
once since joining the team.- He's gonna lose the game for us!
- Wait!If he can get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouseFoxy Loxy can step up and save us all.She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.OK, kid, listen up.You have an itty-bitty,
teeny-tiny strike zone.There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.- I have a good feeling...
- Look at me. Don't swing.Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!- But, coach, wait!
- Don't swing!Nervous, gangly,
barely able to hold the pine,Little advances to the box.
He's going to bat from the right.Make it the left. No, the right.- The right.
- Easy out!Left field's
found something better to do,center field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach- and right field's digging for grubs.
- Play ball!Why him?Why now?I won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.Here's the wind-up,
the pitch! It's a high cutter.Ball!Uh... Strike one!I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.The catcher lays down
the signals. Here's the pitch.Curve ball low and outside, he swings!Stee-rike two!Ohh!I said, don't swing!Don't swing!- No!
- Batter up!That's two in the hole!One more strike,
it's a punch out, folks,and we're all going home.Today is a new day.Don't swing!Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!- A hit?
- A hit?A hit?The batter
is unbelievably at home plate.He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!Go, son! Run! Run!Run!There he goes,
the wrong way.- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!- Run the other way!
- Turn around!He's turned!
I've never said these words before,but he's actually
rounding home plate!- Goosey steps on home...
- A new day!A tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.Catch is complete, but where's the ball?Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Tip the cow!It's the old
tip-the-cow play.He heads for the hot corner,
a stand-up triple!- Yes!
- Hold up! No!He's going for the whole enchilada!The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!Go back! You're never gonna make it!Tries to lighten his load!The outfield behind,
Little's on all cylinders!He slides for the dish!It's going to be
a photo finish at home!You're out!Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.- Wait!
- Wait!Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...He's...Safe! The runner is safe!It's all over, folks!The Acorns have done the impossible!For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!That was just a lucky hit!Yes,
Chicken Little, it's all yours!The victory, the triumph, the glory!And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks into your undiesand chafes for hours!This is one memory you'll savor forever!Yeah!- Yeah!
- Yeah!Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!That's my boy!Yow!Here's the wind-up and the pitch!- A knuckleball!
- He swings!- Crack!
- It's going.- He rounds first, to second!
- Hits high off the wall!He flies past third
and heads for the plate!It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!He is safe!- The mighty Acorns win!
- Yes! Acorns win!The mighty Acorns win!Yeah!Jeez, you know,I guess that puts the whole
"sky is falling" incidentbehind us once and for all. Hey, kiddo?You bet, Dad.I...Unless you think we need... closure?Closure? What's to close here?Unless you think we need to close...- Not me.
- It's closed!- I agree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!OK, great, Dad. You... Closure, I dunno.All right. Enough fun.Good talk. Good talk, son.- Here, I'll give you a push.
- Rock me a little. Help me.- OK.
- OK, I'm up.Hey.Good night, Ace.Here's the wind-up... and the pitch!Whoo-hoo!Thanks.Thanks for the chance.Oh...No!A piece of the sky?!Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!Hey! Son!
You all right? I'm coming!I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs!- What's wrong?
- Nothing.You sure? I thought I heard you yell.No.Uh, I, uh...I fell out of bed.Huh?- How'd you get over there?
- Over where?- There. There!
- Where?How'd you get over there?Who're we talking about?Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?- Mmm.
- Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.Please be gone,
please be gone, please be gone...Good.Ah!No.No.I gotta call Abby!- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.Hello! Mallard residence.Runt! Quiet!
I'm on the phone!Runt!Oh...Hey! Where are you?- We already started. We were...
<i>- It opened up!</i>What?!All right, guys.Watch this.Bizarre.OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.- Well...
- I knew it!Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been- "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."
- There was talking.- There was definitely talking.
- Really? What did he say?Uh...What?All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!You have got to stop messing around
and deal with the problem!- She's right!
- Abby, please.This is exactly what
fell on me the first time.There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.- No, he's not.
- Runt!Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.I don't care. I want it
out of my life, gone for good.Everything back to normal.Hey, remember when
that icy blue stuff fell from the sky?Everybody thought it was
from space and stuff?And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee.Yeah. It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.- Could you stop saying that?
- What? Pee?- Pee.
- Tinkle?- Piddle? Wee-wee?
- Whiz?OK, subject change.- Make pishee?
- I don't care what it is!Are you gonna
help me get rid of it or not?Flying Fish! Take cover!Fish!- No!
- Fish!Aaah!Come on, come on, come on!Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?Chicken Little has something
to tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.Who're we talkin' about?Uh...Gotta go, Dad! Bye!Ha! You got to be ready
to listen to your children,even if they have nothing to say.- Sit tight, Fish!
- Fish! We will try to save you!Yeah!I'm sorry! Wait!Sorry!- Curb!
- Ay!Fish!Abby!Abby! Wake up!Come on! Let's get outta here!Oh, poor Fish!He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or......maybe he's a half-living hostimplanted with
their face-hugging embryo babies.One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!- Gone, man!
- Not yet!Oh, snap.Fish.Hey! What are you doing? Come on!Fish.Fish.Fish.Fish.- Where are you, Fish?!
- Shh!I can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!- Runt.
- You're just fine.I'll jeopardize the mission!
Endanger us all!Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!Just leave me some ammo, little water,some chips if you have 'em.Calm. OK, all right. Listen.- Where's your bag?
- Everything's OK.- Now breathe.
- Breathe.- No, slowly.
- Slowly.Slowly.OK. Now, just do the thing
you do to relax.Aaah!Fish!Fish! Are you OK?Did they hurt you? Say something!Don't tap the glass.
They hate it when you do that.All right, let's get out of here.
Where's Runt?We're next.Run!OK! That's it!We're running back
to your house. Tell your dad!OK! You're right, you're right!Oh, Runt!Push! Push! No!- Runt!

I blacked out there for a second.Ah!<i>The sky is falling!</i>
<i>The sky is falling!</i><i>It was just an acorn.</i>
<i>A little acorn!</i><i>I can't tell you</i>

spaceship right therewith aliens
who are here to invade Earth!Let me show you.Ooh, bad throw.OK, let me try again.- Bad throw.
- We all know I don't have a good arm,but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me right on the head.Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again.Eh, there's no story here.At least we can sell the video
to <i>Chickens Gone Wild.</i>- I'm telling ya, it was here!
- No, wait! There were aliens!It's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!And maps with planets
with X's through them! Aah!Runt, that's enough!Don't make Mommy take away

how embarrassed I am, folks.I'm really sorry about this, everyone.Looks like this is just
a big, crazy misunderstanding.Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!Mr. Cluck, don't take it
so hard. No one blames you.<i>Reports of panic</i>
<i>and mayhem are pouring in</i><i>after yet another Chicken Little</i>

- Hello? I'm sorry.Hello? I apologize.
Hello? Give me a break!What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.I thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.<i>- You have hate mail.</i>
- Sorry. That wasn't very funny.<i>- You have more hate mail.</i>
- Hi. What are you saying, sir?<i>Your hate mail box is full.</i>Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there.Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?Hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah?Oh, yeah? Well,
I'd like to see you try.OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.Hello? Really. Well...If there was ever a time
to talk to your dad......it's now.It's too late for that.It's too late, baby, now it's too late.Though they
really did try to make it.Runt.Just think about it.Something inside has died
and they just can't hideand they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no.Runt, I really just want
to be alone right now.Oh! Abby! Runt! Fish!Look! There!
Look there! Look there!- What is that thing?!
- Look at that!- His name is Kirby?
- They left him behind?Darth Vader is Luke's father?No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.Here, blow.OK.See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.Ah-choo!Whoa.Run!Those are your parents?And they brought the galactic armada?- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
- There you are. Get in the car.- I gotta tell you something.
- What?I know, I know! You were right!
Alien invasion. I see that now.Look up! There it is!Dad, you know, about that...- It's actually a rescue mission.
- Rescue mission?This alien kid was left
and they're coming back to get him!We have to help him,
'cause if we don't, who else will?What?!Ugh!Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.Son!Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little!Mr. Cluck! Wait! He's telling the truth!He is!Given his track record, we understand
why you don't believe him!Watch out for the kid! No! Don't!

Come on! Come...- You, with the running and the jumping!
- Dad. No, wait.What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!It's like <i>War of the Worlds</i> out there!- Stop pulling!
- Just listen to me for one second!- It's not dangerous!
- We are under attack!Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?- You're never there for me!
- What?OK, that's not
what I had in mind, but...You're never there for me. I mean,you were when I won the game,
but not when I thought the sky fell.And not at the ball field and not now!This is good! Keep going. Keep going!You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.We have to talk because
<i>Modern Mallard</i> says avoiding closurecan lead to molting. I'm already smalland I don't think
I could handle being bald!I...I... I didn't......realize, son.I-I never meant to...The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole...You're right. You're right.Y... Your mom, she was...You know, she was always good

- You bet! Anything, son.Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!Crazy supportive. That's me! Ohh!This thing likes to nibble,
doesn't it?By the way, I'd like to say I've
always found you extremely attractive!Now that's closure.Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?!Oh, they've given her
an alien mind-wipe!Aaah!OK, son. What do we do now?Uh, OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!Key to my car?Tic Tac?Forget plan A!Uh-oh.OK, OK, what now, son?Who, by the way, I support 100 percent.- Uh, plan B?
- Ha-ha! Of course! Plan B!What is plan B?What? You have to go
to the bathroom? You want juice?A snack? Corn dog on a stick?Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!I stink at this. I'm a horrible father.No, no, I am.Poo-tee-tah.Oh. Is that your parents?Pooteetah, pooteetah.That's it, Dad! Plan B!All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town squarewhile avoiding death rays
from alien robots.We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roofand give the kid back to its parents.Yeah!Charge!Wow!A-ha!Now that's what I call
takin' out the trash!OK, son. Now what?Fire truck!Plan C!Runt, no! Turn around!- Go back to Town Hall!

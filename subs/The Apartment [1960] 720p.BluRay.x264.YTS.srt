1
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:40,475
On November 1, 1959, the population
of New York City was 8,042,783.

2
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:45,730
If you laid them all end to end, figuring
an average height of 5 feet 6 1/2 inches...

3
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,901
...they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.

4
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,447
I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.

5
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,116
We're one of the top five companies
in the country.

6
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,037
Our home office has 31,259 employees...

7
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:05,500
...which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.

8
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,628
I work on the 19th floor.
Ordinary Policy Department...

9
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,965
...Premium Accounting Division,
Section W, desk number 861.

10
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:18,054
My name is C.C. Baxter: C for Calvin, C
for Clifford. But most people call me Bud.

11
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:23,434
I've worked here three years, ten months,
and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.

12
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,781
The hours in our department
are 8.50 to 5.20.

13
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:46,707
They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees...

14
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,293
...without a serious traffic jam.

15
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,590
As for myself, I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour or two...

16
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,801
...especially when the weather is bad.

17
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,513
It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It's just a way of killing time...

18
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,349
...until it's all right for me to go home.

19
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,019
You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.

20
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,774
I live in the West 60s,
just half a block from Central Park.

21
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,069
My rent is $85 a month.
It used to be $80 until last July...

22
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:19,115
...when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,
put in a second-hand air conditioner.

23
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:24,912
It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,
but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.

24
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,499
The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to.

25
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,600
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.

26
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,769
What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.

27
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,063
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

28
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,525
First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.

29
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,862
- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.

30
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,781
But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.

31
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:06,621
- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.

32
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,428
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Mrs. Lieberman.

33
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:27,600
Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.

34
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:33,648
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

35
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,568
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.

36
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,089
- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.

37
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,425
- Where does she live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.

38
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:06,555
- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

39
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,601
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?

40
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,688
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

41
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,063
- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?

42
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,276
Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

43
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,903
Such a racket I heard in your place.

44
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,156
Maybe you had burglars?

45
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,827
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

46
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:53,287
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

47
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,916
Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

48
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,629
I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

49
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,423
I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

50
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,218
- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

51
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,470
Oh!

52
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,932
I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

53
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,642
- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.

54
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,729
We discussed manpower promotionwise.
I told him you're a bright boy.

55
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,983
They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.

56
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,987
- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

57
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,575
...last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

58
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,996
- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.

59
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:41,460
Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?

60
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,714
Cheese crackers?

61
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,130
Cheers.

62
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,900
- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

63
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,738
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich... including the toothpick.

64
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,367
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

65
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,371
The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

66
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,667
That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

67
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,879
As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

68
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,257
From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.

69
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,929
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.

70
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,058
- A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

71
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,937
You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.

72
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,356
- Could you do us a favor?
- Me?

73
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,276
When you make out your will...
and the way you're going, you should...

74
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,530
...would you mind leaving
your body to the university?

75
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:38,035
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

76
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,455
Slow down, kid.

77
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,996
Oh, for heaven...

78
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:34,008
From the world's greatest library
of film classics, we proudly present...

79
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,593
...Greta Garbo, John Barrymore...

80
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,848
...Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore...

81
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,809
...in "Grand Hotel".

82
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,021
But first, a word from our sponsor.

83
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:51,567
If you smoke the modern way,
don't be fooled by phoney filter claims.

84
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,476
And now, "Grand Hotel"...

85
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,395
...starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore...

86
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:32,107
...Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore.

87
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,528
But first, a word from our alternate sponsor.

88
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,407
Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?

89
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,227
- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.

90
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,189
I'm in this bar on 61 st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

91
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,900
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

92
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,444
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

93
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,407
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.

94
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:26,120
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61 st and I think I got lucky.

95
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,291
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

96
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,754
- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

97
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,632
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

98
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,053
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

99
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,641
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.

100
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,977
You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?

101
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:54,898
No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

102
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:59,236
It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.

103
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,324
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?

104
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,495
- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

105
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,789
Ooh!

106
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,002
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?

107
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,839
I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...

108
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,634
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.

109
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,596
Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.

110
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,848
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

111
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,435
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch!

112
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:36,023
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch!
Be my guest!

113
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,860
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

114
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,657
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

115
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,912
- This the place?
- Yeah.

116
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,039
- How much?
- 70 cents.

117
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,250
Get the money, will you?

118
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,045
Watch those stingers!

119
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,423
- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.

120
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,427
Put it back, honey!

121
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,265
Attagirl.

122
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,560
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.

123
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,937
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

124
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:01,775
Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.

125
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,960
Get the key, will you?

126
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,796
Not there! Under the mat.

127
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,757
- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.

128
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,969
Open up. We haven't got all night.

129
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,892
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.

130
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,159
Mildred! He's at it again!

131
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,379
- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?

132
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,424
- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.

133
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,220
Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.

134
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,223
Good morning, Mr. McKellway,
Mrs Schubert, Mr. Davis.

135
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,017
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

136
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,978
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.

137
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,648
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

138
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,488
- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

139
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,908
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it. [snuffles]

140
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,744
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

141
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,788
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

142
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,749
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

143
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:27,504
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

144
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,090
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

145
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,469
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

146
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,181
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

147
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,851
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

148
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,186
19!

149
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,108
Watch your step.

150
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,777
- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

151
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,489
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

152
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,493
20 next!

153
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,873
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!

154
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,626
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

155
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,796
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

156
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,717
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

157
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,013
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

158
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,724
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

159
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,920
Hello. Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

160
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,797
Oh, Buddy-boy!

161
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,843
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

162
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:01,181
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

163
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,725
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

164
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:08,647
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

165
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,858
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

166
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,153
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

167
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:21,451
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

168
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,037
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

169
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:28,166
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

170
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,503
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

171
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,547
And about your promotion.

172
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,883
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

173
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,511
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

174
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,721
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

175
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,667
From Mr. Dobisch.

176
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,919
Wait.

177
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,599
For Mr. Dobisch.

178
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,399
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

179
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,874
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

180
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,001
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

181
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,546
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

182
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,384
Look, I've got you down for tonight...

183
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,804
...but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

184
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,891
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

185
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:13,146
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

186
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,983
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

187
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:21,321
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

188
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,825
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

189
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:31,665
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

190
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,502
I got somebody penciled in.

191
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,588
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

192
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,019
- Mr. Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

193
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,943
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

194
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,446
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

195
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,993
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

196
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,203
Friday.

197
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,873
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

198
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:24,384
Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18
percent ahead of last year Octoberwise.

199
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,223
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

200
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,560
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

201
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,563
You'd be doing me a great favor.

202
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,482
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

203
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,695
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

204
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,739
Sylvia, it's for you.

205
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,699
Yeah?

206
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,492
Oh, hello.

207
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,912
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

208
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,875
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

209
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:02,255
Thursday?! Well, that's
The Untouchables with Bob Stack!

210
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,591
Bob who?

211
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,762
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

212
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,602
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

213
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,271
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

214
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,450
Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

215
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,794
Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

216
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,598
All right. I'll tell him.

217
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,560
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

218
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:02,732
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

219
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:08,404
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

220
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,700
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

221
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,494
It's a bet!

222
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,802
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

223
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,182
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.

224
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,434
27.

225
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,522
You may not realize it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiencywise...

226
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,441
...and this may be the day promotionwise.

227
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,194
You're beginning to sound
like Mr. Kirkeby already.

228
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:52,365
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

229
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,202
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

230
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,663
Something happens to men in elevators.

231
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,791
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

232
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,128
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

233
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,839
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

234
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,883
Or some evening, after work?

235
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,552
- 27.
- Oh.

236
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,346
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

237
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,224
They would call me today,
what with my cold.

238
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,894
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

239
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,229
Thank you.

240
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:28,234
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

241
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,904
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

242
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,048
C.C. Baxter, Ordinary Premium
Accounting. Mr. Sheldrake called me.

243
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,926
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

244
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,220
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

245
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,441
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,693
Come in, come in.

247
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,530
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

248
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,242
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

249
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,412
Been hearing some nice things about you.

250
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,624
Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

251
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:29,128
- Mr. Dobisch said that?
- Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

252
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,632
...without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

253
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,886
Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

254
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,931
...would both like you
transferred to their departments.

255
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,058
Very flattering.

256
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:47,313
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

257
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,942
- I don't know.
- Think.

258
00:26:56,156 --> 00:27:00,159
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

259
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,831
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

260
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,457
You do?

261
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,129
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

262
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,965
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint...

263
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,635
...tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

264
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:22,015
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

265
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,183
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

266
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,645
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

267
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,274
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

268
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:36,487
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

269
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,573
It's the key to a certain apartment.

270
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,201
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

271
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,705
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative
C.C. Baxter.

272
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,710
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

273
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,715
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

274
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,134
You'd better.

275
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,386
Well...

276
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,725
...about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

277
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:10,897
One of the guys in our department... lives
in Jersey... had to go to a banquet in town.

278
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:15,401
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

279
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:21,532
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

280
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,579
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

281
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,919
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

282
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:36,381
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

283
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,550
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

284
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,429
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

285
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,683
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentagewise.

286
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:52,438
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

287
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,775
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

288
00:28:55,943 --> 00:29:00,947
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

289
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,741
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

290
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:09,330
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbors, the landlady and the key.

291
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,499
How do you work it with the key?

292
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:16,546
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

293
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,262
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

294
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,893
Yes, dear. Where were you?

295
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,399
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

296
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,569
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

297
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,989
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

298
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,324
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

299
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,495
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theater.

300
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,456
Music Man. What else?

301
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,167
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

302
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,754
Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen Music Man?

303
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,507
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

304
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,843
How would you like to go tonight?

305
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:08,306
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

306
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,684
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

307
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,853
Well... that's very kind of you.

308
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:18,024
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

309
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:21,861
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

310
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:25,364
So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

311
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,867
So give the tickets to somebody else.

312
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:32,872
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

313
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,208
Swap 'em? For what?

314
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:42,381
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

315
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,551
Oh?

316
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,642
Oh...

317
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:06,072
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

318
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,076
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

319
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,745
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

320
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,959
And put down the address.

321
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,132
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

322
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,052
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

323
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,263
Yes, thank you, sir.

324
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:35,351
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

325
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,520
Oh, and about the liquor.

326
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:42,275
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

327
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,279
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

328
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,115
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

329
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,952
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

330
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,956
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

331
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,125
Percentagewise.

332
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,836
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

333
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,130
You too, sir.

334
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,999
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.

335
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:44,795
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

336
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,802
- Good night.
- Good night.

337
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,057
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

338
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,352
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognize you.

339
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,688
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

340
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,066
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

341
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,652
- Look, have you seen The Music Man?
- No.

342
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,362
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

343
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,864
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

344
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,532
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

345
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,786
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

346
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,498
- You mean... like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

347
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:25,211
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

348
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,296
You tell 'em now and then.

349
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:31,717
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

350
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,346
Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.

351
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,848
So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.

352
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,559
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

353
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,897
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

354
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,733
I understand.

355
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:52,405
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theater ticket go to waste.

356
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,658
- What time does the show go on?
- 8:30.

357
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,160
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

358
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:02,373
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

359
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,375
I'll meet you in the lobby.

360
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,003
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

361
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,590
Now along comes my promotion
and us... 11 th row centre.

362
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,718
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

363
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,011
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

364
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,182
After the show we could go out
on the town. [hums dance tune]

365
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,102
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

366
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,230
There's a great band
at El Chico, in the Village.

367
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,900
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

368
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,613
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.

369
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,782
Your sister and brother-in-law.

370
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,911
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

371
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,455
How come?

372
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:47,293
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

373
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:51,297
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

374
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:55,468
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

375
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,472
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

376
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,477
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

377
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,815
8:30!

378
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,785
- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

379
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,371
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

380
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:09,208
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

381
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,712
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

382
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,217
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

383
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,679
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

384
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,723
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

385
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:29,061
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

386
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,398
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

387
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,234
Six weeks. But who's counting?

388
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,404
I missed you.

389
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,908
Like old times.

390
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,828
Same booth. Same song.

391
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:50,833
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

392
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,463
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

393
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,842
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

394
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,511
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

395
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:08,225
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

396
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,021
I don't believe you.

397
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,108
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

398
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,111
But that was it. Happens all the time.

399
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:23,407
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary...

400
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,285
...or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

401
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,788
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

402
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,959
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife...

403
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,253
...and the girl...

404
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,591
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

405
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,430
I never said goodbye, Fran.

406
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:53,270
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

407
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,148
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

408
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,943
...and asks you if any lipstick's showing...

409
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,655
...then rushes out to catch
the 7:14 to White Plains.

410
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,326
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

411
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:11,330
...and you sit there
by yourself and you think...

412
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,626
...and it all begins to look so... ugly.

413
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:22,841
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7:14 train?

414
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,179
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

415
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,348
I want you back, Fran.

416
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:33,435
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

417
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,481
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

418
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:41,485
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

419
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,530
- No. I have a date at 8:30.
- Oh?

420
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,659
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

421
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,453
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

422
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,164
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

423
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,895
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

424
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,900
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

425
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,403
Do you remember what we talked about?

426
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,157
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

427
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,659
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

428
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,828
You didn't believe me, did you?

429
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,416
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

430
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:42,379
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

431
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,841
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

432
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,761
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

433
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,223
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

434
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,437
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

435
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,106
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

436
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:07,071
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

437
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,948
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

438
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,078
Are you sure that's what you want?

439
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,749
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

440
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,962
You know I do.

441
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,801
Fran.

442
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,473
Jeff, darling...

443
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,982
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

444
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,850
Taxi!

445
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,603
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

446
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,356
- [Whistles]
- Where are we going?

447
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,359
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

448
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,366
51 West 67th.

449
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,245
Congratulations.

450
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,680
Would you mind? C.C. Baxter... that's me.

451
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,228
Thank you.

452
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,913
Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

453
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,541
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

454
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,878
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

455
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:14,716
Teamwork: That's what counts in this
organization. All for one and one for all.

456
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,885
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

457
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,138
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitudewise.

458
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,767
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

459
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:29,481
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... like that.

460
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,442
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

461
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,905
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

462
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:41,285
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

463
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,161
How selfish can you get?

464
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,082
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

465
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,252
I'm too old for that sort of thing...
I mean in a Volkswagen.

466
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,672
I sympathize with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

467
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,092
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

468
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,345
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

469
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,474
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

470
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,729
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

471
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,773
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

472
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,694
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

473
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,657
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

474
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,535
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

475
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,246
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

476
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,208
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

477
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:35,130
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

478
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,674
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

479
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,635
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that?
- Oh, no, no.

480
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:46,058
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

481
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,810
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

482
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,980
Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.

483
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,649
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

484
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,527
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

485
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,239
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

486
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,702
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

487
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,330
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

488
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:09,539
Yeah, I know how it is.

489
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:14,419
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

490
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,756
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

491
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,925
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

492
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:24,888
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

493
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,598
That's the life all right.

494
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,017
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

495
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,436
And I'll get that other key.

496
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:47,452
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

497
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,621
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

498
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,790
Yeah? Yeah?!

499
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,041
Where?

500
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,418
You bet!

501
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,964
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

502
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,177
 Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

503
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:08,098
 Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way

504
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,476
 Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh 

505
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,165
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

506
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,084
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

507
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,462
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

508
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,673
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

509
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:45,594
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

510
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,181
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

511
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,349
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

512
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,101
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

513
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,688
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

514
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,065
...because you have a date
with another man.

515
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,610
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

516
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,197
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

517
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:10,118
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

518
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,704
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

519
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:17,542
I mean decencywise and... otherwisewise.

520
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,836
Cheers.

521
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,840
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

522
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:29,054
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

523
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,556
Shall we join the natives?

524
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:35,227
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it.

525
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,523
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

526
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,900
...and punched full of little square holes.

527
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,236
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

528
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,572
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

529
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,367
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

530
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,411
Hi!

531
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,164
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

532
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,999
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

533
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,085
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

534
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,587
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

535
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,758
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

536
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:11,221
...four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

537
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:16,226
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

538
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,020
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

539
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,523
And right before you was a Miss, um...

540
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:24,025
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

541
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:27,696
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

542
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,116
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

543
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,035
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

544
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:37,289
...and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

545
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:43,795
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

546
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,089
Miss Kubelik!

547
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,884
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

548
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,222
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

549
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,475
Are you all right? What's the matter?

550
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,228
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

551
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:04,316
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

552
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:09,237
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

553
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:13,158
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

554
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,453
Do you mind?

555
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:24,085
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

556
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,505
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.

557
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,009
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

558
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:41,645
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

559
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,942
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

560
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,320
- I like it.
- Really?

561
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,365
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

562
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,494
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

563
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,372
- Is that better?
- Much better.

564
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,208
Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me...

565
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:06,461
...how about goin' out tonight...
you, me and the bowler?

566
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,381
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.

567
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,385
- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.

568
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,887
I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.

569
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,891
Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

570
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,143
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

571
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,897
- Why?
- He and I are like that.

572
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,817
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

573
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,242
Makes a cute picture.

574
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,870
I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.

575
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:46,751
- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

576
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,213
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

577
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:54,759
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

578
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,053
I think so. Here.

579
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,223
It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.

580
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:03,518
I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.

581
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,024
What's the matter?

582
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,280
- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.

583
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,284
I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.

584
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,749
Your phone.

585
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,465
Yes?

586
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,800
Uh, just a minute.

587
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:40,555
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.

588
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,314
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

589
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:55,653
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

590
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,947
Yes, sir. Same to you.

591
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,644
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

592
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:30,021
The party's just starting.

593
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,525
Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

594
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:39,280
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

595
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:21,072
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

596
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,559
You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.

597
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,811
Rum Collins.

598
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,156
Uh...

599
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,993
Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.

600
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,007
You like Castro?

601
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:06,010
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

602
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,973
- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

603
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,266
- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?

604
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,687
Cause as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

605
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,190
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

606
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,316
That so?

607
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:24,237
All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.

608
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,447
- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.

609
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,158
He's in Havana, in jail.

610
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,829
- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.

611
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:36,708
He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.

612
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,210
Well, you can't win 'em all.

613
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,969
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house

614
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:50,221
Not a creature was stirrin'...

615
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,058
Nothin'. No action.

616
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,477
Dullsville.

617
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,730
- You married?
- No.

618
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,982
- Family?
- No.

619
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:06,362
A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.

620
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:12,076
I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.

621
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,417
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

622
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,046
Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?

623
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,549
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?

624
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:33,264
I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years...

625
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:38,019
...you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

626
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,772
It's not that easy.

627
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:46,778
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

628
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,946
I can't bring it up now.

629
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:55,953
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

630
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:02,627
That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.

631
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:07,882
Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

632
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:12,220
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

633
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,889
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

634
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,934
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

635
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,813
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

636
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,567
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

637
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:29,821
Well, I never was very good at history.

638
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:34,742
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

639
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,995
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

640
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,498
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

641
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,502
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

642
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,421
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

643
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,676
But ask yourself: Why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

644
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:55,596
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

645
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:59,016
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

646
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,647
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

647
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:09,360
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

648
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:13,239
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

649
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,035
- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?

650
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,210
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

651
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:32,717
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.

652
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,553
Oh, I have a present for you.

653
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:40,057
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

654
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,728
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

655
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,903
They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

656
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,752
I didn't realize it was so late. It's quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

657
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,506
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

658
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,886
OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

659
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,096
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

660
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:23,392
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

661
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,605
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

662
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,899
Stop it, Fran.

663
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,027
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

664
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,204
Are you coming?

665
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:45,957
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

666
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,626
Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.

667
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:52,380
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

668
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,800
...and Monday again, and Thursday again.

669
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,638
It won't always be like this, Fran.

670
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,932
I love you.

671
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,393
Careful. Lipstick.

672
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,771
Merry Christmas.

673
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:39,672
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.

674
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,384
- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.

675
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,636
I work for the outfit.

676
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,978
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

677
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:04,405
O-U-T. Out!

678
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,996
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

679
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,002
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.

680
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:35,019
Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...

681
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,354
Would you like to see his picture?

682
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,607
Not particularly.

683
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:45,738
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

684
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:48,032
Like a little Chihuahua.

685
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,923
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

686
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,050
You got a girlfriend?

687
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,053
She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.

688
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:13,390
- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.

689
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,268
- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.

690
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:23,108
C.C. Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

691
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,737
I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.

692
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,115
This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

693
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,379
Say! This is snugsville!

694
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:46,090
Mrs. MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you...

695
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:49,593
...you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.

696
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,429
- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.

697
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,600
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go... and I may go just like that...

698
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,645
I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.

699
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,773
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.

700
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,235
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

701
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:09,280
Let's not waste any more time
preliminarywise.

702
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,490
I'm with you, lover.

703
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:30,569
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

704
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,530
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

705
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:38,077
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

706
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:46,210
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

707
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,921
O-U-T, out!

708
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,174
Come on, wake up.

709
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,641
Oh my God.

710
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:05,688
Miss Kubelik?

711
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:18,283
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

712
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,578
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

713
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,874
I didn't mean right now!

714
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,921
Dr. Dreyfuss.

715
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,507
Doc!

716
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:38,470
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

717
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,764
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

718
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:46,228
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

719
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,106
You're gonna wear yourself out.

720
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:52,443
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

721
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,611
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

722
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,947
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

723
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,409
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

724
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,619
Not this one. In there, Doc.

725
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,291
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

726
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:08,959
My shoes!

727
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:12,129
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

728
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,965
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

729
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:20,596
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

730
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,806
You fink!

731
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,324
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

732
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:44,495
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

733
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,664
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

734
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,417
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

735
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:53,337
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

736
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,215
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

737
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,230
Bring my bag.

738
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,075
Roll up her right sleeve.

739
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,920
Hold that.

740
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,971
Nice veins.

741
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,485
Wanna tell me what happened?

742
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,363
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

743
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:50,120
You see, we had... some words earlier.

744
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:54,458
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

745
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,295
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

746
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:03,258
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

747
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,968
Yes, you are.

748
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:18,315
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

749
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,169
Get the coffee.

750
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:05,570
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

751
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,879
What's her name?

752
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,757
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

753
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:34,307
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

754
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,685
Do you understand what I'm saying?

755
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:41,898
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

756
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:45,027
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

757
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,823
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

758
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,535
- Doctor?
- Dr. Dreyfuss.

759
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,539
Dreyfuss.

760
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,750
Get more coffee.

761
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,128
Now tell me again. What's my name?

762
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,633
Dr... Dreyfuss.

763
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,927
And what happened to you?

764
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,096
I...

765
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,390
I took sleeping pills.

766
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:18,435
Do you know where you are?

767
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,690
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

768
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,652
I don't know.

769
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,614
Do you know who that is?

770
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,456
Look at him.

771
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,418
Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.

772
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,129
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

773
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,132
Mr? Miss? Such politeness!

774
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:54,471
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

775
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,809
What are you doing here?

776
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:04,022
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

777
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,566
Oh, yes. The office party.

778
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,319
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

779
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,364
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

780
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:15,909
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

781
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,163
I don't understand.

782
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:25,710
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

783
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,839
I'm so tired.

784
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,091
Come on. Drink this.

785
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,094
Please... just let me sleep.

786
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:38,140
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

787
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,851
Let's get her walking.

788
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:48,024
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

789
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:53,196
One, two, three, four!

790
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,532
Left, right, left, right...

791
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,868
...left, right and return!

792
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,204
And... one, two, three, four!

793
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:04,749
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

794
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,128
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

795
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:10,922
One, two... And return again.

796
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,259
And... left, right, left, right.

797
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:24,728
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

798
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:28,565
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

799
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,901
Just as long as she's OK.

800
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:36,406
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

801
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,701
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

802
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,079
How do you spell her last name?

803
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,707
Kubelik. Two k's.

804
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,918
What's her address?

805
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,754
Where does she live?

806
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,216
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

807
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:58,386
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

808
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:03,475
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

809
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,769
There was no suicide note or anything.

810
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:09,064
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

811
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,651
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

812
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:16,696
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbor?

813
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,741
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

814
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,036
But as your neighbor,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

815
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,747
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

816
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,291
I don't know what you did to that girl...

817
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,961
...but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

818
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,630
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

819
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:38,468
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.

820
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,971
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

821
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,265
A mensch! A human being!

822
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:47,185
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

823
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:52,065
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

824
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,694
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

825
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,518
Mr. Baxter! Open up already.

826
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,690
Oh.

827
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,235
- Mrs. Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

828
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,446
What was going on here last night?

829
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,949
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

830
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,703
- Army maneuvers maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

831
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:33,041
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

832
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:38,713
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

833
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:43,968
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

834
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,221
Come on, Oscar.

835
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:17,794
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr. J.D. Sheldrake.

836
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:20,046
Make that person-to-person.

837
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:27,804
Five, four, three, two, one...

838
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,515
Let her rip!


839
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,267
I'll get the phone.

840
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:35,353
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

841
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,398
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

842
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:42,610
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

843
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,906
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

844
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:50,827
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

845
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,164
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

846
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:57,500
A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.

847
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,253
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

848
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:06,009
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

849
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:09,512
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

850
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,349
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

851
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:18,605
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

852
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,941
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

853
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:27,238
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

854
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:30,783
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

855
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,744
Yes, Baxter.

856
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:35,205
Just how serious is it?

857
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,000
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

858
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,212
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

859
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:47,675
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

860
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:52,222
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

861
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,726
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

862
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,562
Well, it was just a suggestion.

863
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:03,608
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble...

864
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,319
...policewise or newspaperwise.

865
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,866
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

866
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,536
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

867
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,580
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

868
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,542
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

869
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:24,921
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

870
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:28,925
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

871
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:32,428
...and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

872
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,558
OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

873
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:40,270
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

874
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,939
Well, I'll... think of something.

875
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,650
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

876
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,613
I'm sorry.

877
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:54,909
- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

878
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,246
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

879
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,124
Here. Let me help you.

880
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,626
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

881
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,795
Why didn't you just let me die?

882
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:11,467
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

883
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,094
Oh!

884
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:17,515
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

885
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:20,435
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

886
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,812
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

887
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,398
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

888
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,984
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

889
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:31,279
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

890
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:34,949
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

891
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,620
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

892
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,497
Here. Put that on.

893
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,863
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

894
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,032
I'll fix you some coffee.

895
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,495
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

896
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,705
Back in a minute.

897
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,384
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

898
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:38,346
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

899
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:42,975
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

900
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:45,353
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

901
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,523
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

902
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:54,821
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriagewise.

903
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:58,408
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

904
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,744
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

905
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,921
Who are you calling?

906
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,215
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

907
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:19,387
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

908
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:24,058
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

909
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,270
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

910
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,355
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

911
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:31,524
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

912
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,443
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

913
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,945
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

914
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,281
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

915
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:41,534
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

916
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:44,454
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

917
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,622
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

918
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,584
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

919
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:54,630
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

920
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,925
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

921
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,262
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

922
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,515
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

923
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,435
Thanks for reminding me!

924
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,149
I didn't mean it that way.

925
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:17,445
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

926
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,323
He doesn't give a damn about me.

927
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:24,160
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

928
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:26,579
But that's not the worst part.

929
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:29,165
The worst part is I still love him.

930
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,338
Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

931
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:39,008
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

932
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,762
So where's the victim?

933
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,848
Max the Knife!

934
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:52,647
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

935
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:58,152
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

936
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,698
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

937
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,785
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

938
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:09,121
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

939
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,708
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

940
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,210
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

941
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:17,004
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

942
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,173
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

943
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,426
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

944
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,888
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

945
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,016
Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.

946
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,563
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

947
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,731
With the no napkins.

948
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:39,902
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

949
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:42,655
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

950
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:46,909
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man... a widower, maybe...

951
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:50,746
...and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.

952
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:54,041
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

953
01:26:56,253 --> 01:27:00,256
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

954
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:03,551
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

955
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:07,597
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

956
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:10,349
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

957
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:15,438
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

958
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:18,107
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

959
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:23,487
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

960
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,742
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

961
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:29,452
Yes. I've got it.

962
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:33,956
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

963
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:36,208
Open it.

964
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,381
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

965
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:45,968
That's right. Will you see
that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?

966
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,138
Sure.

967
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:52,725
Take this away, will you?

968
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,187
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

969
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:59,106
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

970
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:03,235
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

971
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,114
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

972
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:11,953
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo...

973
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,830
...then came home and cleaned up
after Mr. Eichelberger.

974
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,333
He had a little eggnog party here.

975
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,794
So I'm way ahead this year.

976
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:22,672
Three across. Spades double?

977
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,882
High deals.

978
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,635
Six? Eight.

979
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:38,521
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

980
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,524
Give what up?

981
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:47,530
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

982
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,033
I know what you mean.

983
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:56,330
Queen.

984
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,544
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

985
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:10,678
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

986
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:14,181
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

987
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:20,563
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

988
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,815
A cemetery?

989
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:25,693
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

990
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:30,031
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

991
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,534
Uh, gin.

992
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:42,168
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

993
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,378
I have this talent for falling in love...

994
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:48,049
...with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

995
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:50,926
Well, how many guys were there?

996
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:53,929
Three.

997
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:58,017
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

998
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:00,186
They found a shortage in his accounts.

999
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:04,106
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1000
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,735
Cut.

1001
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:13,407
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1002
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:18,412
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1003
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,748
But I flunked the typing test.

1004
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:23,626
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1005
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,920
I just can't spell.

1006
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:31,967
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1007
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:34,637
And that's how I met Jeff.

1008
01:30:35,806 --> 01:30:38,432
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1009
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,060
What am I gonna do now?

1010
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,481
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1011
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,902
Was he very upset when you told him?

1012
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,154
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1013
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:57,076
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1014
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:58,661
I'm sure that's it.

1015
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:02,206
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1016
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,835
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1017
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:09,004
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1018
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,507
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1019
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:15,594
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1020
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:19,140
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1021
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:23,477
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1022
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:27,314
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1023
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,610
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1024
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:34,864
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1025
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:44,456
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1026
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,500
Gin.

1027
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:55,801
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1028
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,014
Spades are double... 154.

1029
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,229
Blitzed. Two games.

1030
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,656
 All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1031
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,291
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?

1032
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,459
What do I want? Just a minute.

1033
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,254
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1034
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:57,464
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1035
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,883
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1036
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,554
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1037
01:34:03,722 --> 01:34:07,516
Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1038
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:11,145
Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?

1039
01:34:11,313 --> 01:34:14,481
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1040
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:23,490
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1041
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,701
Mildred!

1042
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:31,707
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1043
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,959
No!

1044
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,382
Well, I don't blame you.

1045
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,552
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelikwise.

1046
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,221
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1047
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,640
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1048
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,741
Who was that?

1049
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:09,995
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1050
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:13,540
Would you mind opening that window?

1051
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:21,590
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1052
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:25,094
It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1053
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:28,013
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1054
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:31,600
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1055
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:34,269
- Who'd care?
- I would.

1056
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:43,946
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1057
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:46,949
Yeah. Well...

1058
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:50,577
That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1059
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,415
Go to sleep.

1060
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:33,328
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1061
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:46,633
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!

1062
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,428
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1063
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:54,183
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1064
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,852
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1065
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,938
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1066
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:03,150
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1067
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,361
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1068
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:10,949
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1069
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:14,203
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1070
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,497
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1071
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:29,384
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.

1072
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,513
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1073
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,407
- Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1074
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,910
Yes. She's in the shower.

1075
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,746
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1076
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:01,500
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

1077
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:04,795
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1078
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:06,338
Oh.

1079
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,300
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1080
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:13,262
But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.

1081
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,848
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1082
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,268
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1083
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,021
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1084
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:27,734
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1085
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,862
There's a call for you!

1086
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:33,532
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

1087
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,452
I don't wanna talk to him.

1088
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,538
I think you should.

1089
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:45,085
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1090
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,963
I'll be right back. OK?

1091
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,485
Hello, Jeff.

1092
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:15,032
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1093
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,659
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1094
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,495
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1095
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:25,375
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1096
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:27,669
Fran?

1097
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:30,672
Are you there, Fran?

1098
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,553
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1099
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:40,557
I never took those pills,
I never loved you...

1100
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:43,018
...we never even met.

1101
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:48,190
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1102
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:51,109
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1103
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:54,404
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1104
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,258
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1105
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,638
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1106
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:24,142
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1107
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:26,978
It concerns your husband.

1108
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:30,899
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1109
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,408
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1110
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,618
Just making a personal call.

1111
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,372
Here's a dime.

1112
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:49,751
Going down.

1113
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:04,641
Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1114
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:07,436
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1115
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,355
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1116
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:12,607
Gas?!

1117
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,785
Miss Kubelik?

1118
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,664
Miss Kubelik!

1119
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,461
- You all right?
- Sure!

1120
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:36,465
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1121
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:39,551
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1122
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:43,138
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1123
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:47,058
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1124
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:50,645
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1125
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:54,941
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3 1/2 pair.

1126
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:57,611
Things are a little disorganized
around here.

1127
01:41:57,779 --> 01:42:01,573
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1128
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:06,661
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

1129
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,498
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1130
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:12,209
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1131
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:15,170
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1132
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:19,674
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick...

1133
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:23,512
...a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1134
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,932
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1135
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:31,186
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1136
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:34,439
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1137
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,610
- He's a taker.
- What?

1138
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:41,363
Some people take, some people get took.

1139
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:45,534
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1140
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,786
I wouldn't say that.

1141
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:50,539
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1142
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:53,875
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1143
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:56,002
I really should be getting home.

1144
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,130
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1145
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:03,718
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1146
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:09,015
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1147
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:12,102
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1148
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:17,899
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1149
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:20,569
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1150
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,654
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1151
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:24,573
I tried to do it with a gun.

1152
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:27,784
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1153
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:32,956
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1154
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:37,252
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a.45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1155
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,462
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1156
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:42,257
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1157
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:46,761
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1158
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:50,599
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1159
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:54,603
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1160
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,605
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1161
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,274
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1162
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,776
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1163
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:05,280
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1164
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:09,075
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1165
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:12,412
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1166
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:17,667
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1167
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:20,211
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1168
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:22,797
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1169
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,966
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1170
01:44:25,134 --> 01:44:27,302
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1171
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:30,722
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1172
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:34,976
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1173
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:38,355
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1174
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:41,816
- Yes, Nurse.
- [Baxter hums opera music]

1175
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:59,167
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1176
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:04,506
- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1177
01:45:04,674 --> 01:45:08,969
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21 st floor.

1178
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,929
Thanks.

1179
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:17,852
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1180
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,270
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1181
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:22,524
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1182
01:45:22,692 --> 01:45:27,195
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1183
01:45:27,363 --> 01:45:28,947
AWOL, hm?

1184
01:45:29,115 --> 01:45:31,658
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1185
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:35,412
...while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1186
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,124
- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1187
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:44,295
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1188
01:45:44,463 --> 01:45:45,922
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1189
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:49,926
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1190
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:52,470
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous

1191
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:55,223
cause Fran hasn't been home
for two days.

1192
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:56,725
That so?

1193
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:59,894
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1194
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:01,479
I see.

1195
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:05,233
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1196
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:08,778
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1197
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:12,490
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1198
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,037
Who is Buddy-boy?

1199
01:46:41,187 --> 01:46:45,023
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1200
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:49,360
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1201
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:54,324
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1202
01:46:54,492 --> 01:46:58,536
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious livingwise.

1203
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:03,166
 Meatball

1204
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,588
 Meatball

1205
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:20,642
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1206
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:26,439
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1207
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:28,817
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1208
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:32,153
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1209
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:34,364
...and there you were.

1210
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:37,492
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1211
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,496
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1212
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:44,415
Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.

1213
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:48,545
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1214
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:51,548
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1215
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:53,758
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1216
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:56,177
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1217
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,721
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1218
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:01,599
So keep a clear head.

1219
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:06,396
Cause I don't wanna take advantage of
you, the way I did yesterday in bed.

1220
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:08,731
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1221
01:48:17,867 --> 01:48:20,535
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1222
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:24,372
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...

1223
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,877
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1224
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:31,796
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.

1225
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:35,550
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1226
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:38,178
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1227
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:41,264
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1228
01:48:50,441 --> 01:48:52,567
Want a martini?

1229
01:48:56,488 --> 01:49:00,408
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1230
01:49:05,915 --> 01:49:08,750
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1231
01:49:11,921 --> 01:49:16,424
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1232
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:22,931
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1233
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:25,099
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1234
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,310
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1235
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:32,941
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1236
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:35,526
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1237
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:39,614
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1238
01:49:39,782 --> 01:49:41,908
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1239
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:45,245
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1240
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:48,623
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1241
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:51,292
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1242
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,461
You?

1243
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:55,463
Who else?

1244
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:02,387
Leave him alone!

1245
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:08,059
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1246
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:13,314
- [Karl] Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1247
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:21,322
Goodbye, Doctor.

1248
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:27,996
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1249
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:33,084
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1250
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:35,169
Let me get my bag.

1251
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:39,215
Don't bother, Doc.

1252
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,467
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1253
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,533
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C. Baxter.

1254
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:08,911
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1255
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:11,205
Will you call me back, please?

1256
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,045
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1257
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:20,256
All your troubles are over.

1258
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:24,302
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1259
01:51:25,095 --> 01:51:27,597
The plain fact is, I love her.

1260
01:51:28,474 --> 01:51:31,059
I thought you should be the first to know.

1261
01:51:31,226 --> 01:51:34,062
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1262
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:38,316
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1263
01:51:38,484 --> 01:51:41,903
So I think it would be best all around.


1264
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:43,488
Solutionwise.

1265
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:44,906
Yes?

1266
01:51:45,074 --> 01:51:47,200
I'll be right up.

1267
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:50,745
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1268
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,955
All your troubles are over.

1269
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:59,420
19.

1270
01:51:59,588 --> 01:52:03,257
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1271
01:52:03,425 --> 01:52:06,302
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1272
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:09,597
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1273
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:11,265
27.

1274
01:52:11,433 --> 01:52:13,851
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1275
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:16,979
...made me realize
how lonely I'd been before.

1276
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:20,650
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1277
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:23,820
If I can ever square things with her family.

1278
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:26,447
Good morning. C.C. Baxter.

1279
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:32,453
- Mr. Baxter is here.
- Send him in.

1280
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:37,542
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1281
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,794
And I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1282
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,296
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1283
01:52:42,631 --> 01:52:45,800
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1284
01:52:45,968 --> 01:52:48,803
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1285
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:51,806
- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.

1286
01:52:51,974 --> 01:52:54,475
I've moved out of the house.

1287
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:58,354
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1288
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:01,482
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1289
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:06,446
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1290
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,156
Yeah.

1291
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:10,241
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1292
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:16,038
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1293
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:19,333
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1294
01:53:19,501 --> 01:53:21,544
This way, Baxter.

1295
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:27,341
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1296
01:53:28,343 --> 01:53:30,845
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1297
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:36,184
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1298
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:38,769
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1299
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:43,191
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1300
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:46,068
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1301
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:51,199
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.

1302
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:56,871
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1303
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:59,874
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1304
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:03,461
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1305
01:54:03,629 --> 01:54:06,255
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1306
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:11,010
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1307
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:13,554
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1308
01:54:13,722 --> 01:54:16,474
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1309
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:39,622
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1310
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,249
Oh.

1311
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:44,168
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1312
01:54:44,336 --> 01:54:47,004
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1313
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:49,966
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1314
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:53,135
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1315
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:57,139
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1316
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:59,850
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1317
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:02,603
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1318
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:06,232
- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1319
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,401
You were wrong about me too.

1320
01:55:08,569 --> 01:55:11,696
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1321
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:15,032
Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?

1322
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:19,662
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1323
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,831
A paneled office, three windows.

1324
01:55:21,999 --> 01:55:25,001
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1325
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:28,045
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1326
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:33,968
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1327
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:40,725
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1328
01:55:40,892 --> 01:55:46,147
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorcewise.

1329
01:55:46,315 --> 01:55:48,399
That's very wise.

1330
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:51,986
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

1331
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:31,359
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1332
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:33,569
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1333
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:41,202
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1334
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:44,288
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1335
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:47,416
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1336
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:49,752
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1337
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,921
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1338
01:56:52,089 --> 01:56:56,425
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1339
01:56:56,593 --> 01:56:58,761
If you don't mind?

1340
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:03,057
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1341
01:57:03,225 --> 01:57:06,394
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik...

1342
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:10,564
...I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1343
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:13,067
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1344
01:57:14,528 --> 01:57:17,321
- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1345
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:19,865
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1346
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:24,370
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1347
01:57:24,538 --> 01:57:27,790
- How's that again?
- No key.

1348
01:57:29,626 --> 01:57:34,213
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1349
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:37,800
Do you realize what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1350
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:41,303
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1351
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:44,473
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1352
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:47,268
- You dig?
- I dig.

1353
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:50,479
So what's it going to be?

1354
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,364
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1355
01:58:17,758 --> 01:58:20,426
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1356
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:23,220
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1357
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:27,141
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1358
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:30,686
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1359
01:58:30,854 --> 01:58:35,065
I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.

1360
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:39,153
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.

1361
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:41,405
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1362
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:20,903
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1363
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:23,155
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1364
01:59:23,323 --> 01:59:25,241
Well, I got things to do.

1365
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:29,578
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1366
01:59:29,746 --> 01:59:31,580
Where are you moving to?

1367
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:34,750
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1368
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,919
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1369
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:41,799
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1370
01:59:41,967 --> 01:59:45,135
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1371
01:59:45,303 --> 01:59:47,096
Say, why don't you join us?

1372
01:59:47,264 --> 01:59:52,226
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1373
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:54,311
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1374
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,691
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1375
01:59:58,859 --> 02:00:02,695
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbor.

1376
02:00:02,863 --> 02:00:05,573
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1377
02:00:06,825 --> 02:00:09,785
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1378
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:12,663
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1379
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:58,459
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1380
02:00:58,627 --> 02:01:01,045
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1381
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:04,048
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1382
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:08,802
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1383
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:12,640
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1384
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:15,059
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1385
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:18,854
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1386
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:19,980
Baxter?

1387
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,651
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1388
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,362
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1389
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:29,615
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1390
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:35,037
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1391
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:39,500
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1392
02:01:39,668 --> 02:01:42,461
What's he got against you, anyway?

1393
02:01:42,629 --> 02:01:48,550
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookiewise.

1394
02:01:50,553 --> 02:01:53,013
What are you talking about?

1395
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:57,476
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1396
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,486
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1397
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:12,616
 And never brought to mind...

1398
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:15,995
Happy New Year, Fran.

1399
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:22,459
 And days of auld lang syne

1400
02:02:23,294 --> 02:02:28,424
 For auld lang syne, my dear

1401
02:02:28,591 --> 02:02:33,554
 For auld lang syne

1402
02:02:33,722 --> 02:02:38,934
 We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

1403
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:44,732
 For auld lang syne 

1404
02:02:56,453 --> 02:02:58,537
Fran?

1405
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:01,874
Where are you, Fran?

1406
02:03:19,976 --> 02:03:23,520
Mr. Baxter!

1407
02:03:23,855 --> 02:03:26,899
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1408
02:03:29,861 --> 02:03:31,153
Oh!

1409
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:34,406
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1410
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:37,076
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1411
02:03:37,786 --> 02:03:39,870
I'm fine all over.

1412
02:03:41,873 --> 02:03:45,334
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1413
02:03:49,047 --> 02:03:51,131
Let me get another glass.

1414
02:03:54,052 --> 02:03:56,136
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1415
02:03:56,304 --> 02:03:59,598
Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

1416
02:03:59,766 --> 02:04:02,059
I'm on my own.

1417
02:04:02,227 --> 02:04:04,311
That's funny. So am I.

1418
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,731
What'd you do with the cards?

1419
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:09,983
In there.

1420
02:04:21,287 --> 02:04:23,288
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

1421
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:26,583
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

1422
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:31,088
Cut.

1423
02:04:32,715 --> 02:04:34,800
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1424
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:37,094
Three.

1425
02:04:37,262 --> 02:04:38,428
Queen.

1426
02:04:38,596 --> 02:04:42,641
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1427
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:47,354
Shut up and deal.

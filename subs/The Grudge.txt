on their own terms.</i><i>I want to start
by answering</i><i>any questions
you might have for me.</i><i>How long will
it take her to die?</i><i>Our preferred method is a gas</i><i>that requires
the use of a hood.</i><i>Once she pulls the hood
down over her head,</i><i>she'll be unconscious
in five to 10 seconds.</i><i>That's all she'll know.</i>How many times
have you done this?I've been
a compassionate presenceat the bedside of 44 people.Tell me about your wife.We found out
she was sick last year.She was pretty far gone...by the time we realized.So we moved here...so she could be closer
to her doctors.But after the move,she started getting worse.I'm so sorry.I'm glad you called.Hopefully, I can help.I hope so.Mr. Matheson,
I need to warn you.For anyone to do this,they must be mentally competentand physically able to
carry it through themselves.Is that clear?

on the requirements,and I'm truly, deeply sorry,but your wife is no longer
mentally competent.Please.You can't just leave.I am deeply sorryfor everything you and
your wife have been through...but you misrepresented
her condition.What am I supposed to do?I would still like
to stay a few days,if that's all right with you.I may not be able to help
in the way that you wanted,but at least I could provide
some support, no matter what.Is that okay with you?So, what do you like to do

the guest room for you.We don't get much company.Oh, it's lovely.All right, well, I have to run

have to do that.Not much in the kitchen either.Well, let me go.
It's the least I can do.Oh!Hello.Excuse me.Excuse me, sir.Mr. Matheson.There's a strange man
standing on your front lawn.I think there's
something wrong with him.<i>Hello?</i>He's here again.- <i>My partner?</i>
- Yeah.<i>I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.</i>Yeah. Okay.See you soon.Who is he?He's a cop.What's he doing?Who knows?

some questionsabout a case that you worked
two years ago.What can you tell me
about the Landers family?It's happening again,
isn't it?Once you step into the place
where they died,it never lets you go.This is never gonna end.What will never end?That house's grudge.There she is.You went into the Landers'
house, didn't you?If you haven't started seeing
them yet, don't worry.You will.Maybe we should
tear our eyes outso that we can't
see them anymore.No!It's the house!You gotta burn it down!Ahh! Burn it to the ground!Wait. Kill me.Kill me! Kill me!Guys, he's losing blood fast!I can still feel them

thinking about the Landers' murder.</i><i>What the hell happened
in that house?</i>Who does that
to a 6-year-old girl?Nobody does that to
a 6-year-old girl. A monster.<i>Now, ever since I went
to that house,</i><i>I've been seeing shit.</i><i>I can't get it out of my head.</i><i>There's a case I found
in Japan.</i><i>At least a dozen
unrelated people</i><i>killed in the same house
in Tokyo.</i><i>And I spoke to the detective
over there, this Nakagawa.</i><i>He thinks a murder
in that house</i><i>caused something</i>
<i>called a</i> Ju-On.Something like a curse.<i>Fiona Landers worked
at that same house in Tokyo,</i><i>and I know this sounds crazy.</i><i>I think Fiona Landers</i><i>brought this curse
back with her from Japan.</i><i>And it made her
kill her family.</i>- Where is he?
- Where do you think?All right, all right. Focus.
Just focus. Just focus.That's what she said
when we started.- Hey.

you ate?- You look like shit.
- It's the case.The case is cold.Don't give me that shit.You know something
awful's going on.I get it.I do.And I wish I knew
how to help you.Just, you know,
take some time off.Spend some time with
the girls.And then maybe it'll stop.They're never gonna stop.Never.It's Fiona Landers.She's the one
who's been doing this.Let's get out of here.Come on.You good?Yeah. Yeah.- Ahh!
- What? Stop it.- Oh, God! Ahh!

the wrong way, but I believe...your house...is haunted.I thought someone like you...might understand our unique...situation.Wh...? You mean,
you've seen her too?Mm-hm.Seeing them...it gives me hope that maybe
she might be around too.After it's over.You see, I think,<i>with places like this,</i><i>it feels like the walls
between this world</i><i>and the next
have been torn down.</i><i>Time acts differently here.</i><i>Anyone who has entered here</i><i>and anyone who will enter here,</i><i>we're all bound together.</i>When Faith goes,this place
will let us stay together.It's the only hope
that we have.Mr. Matheson?Mrs. Matheson?I'm so happy to see you

like this even happen?Hey.Did you get any word
on that body we found?- The feds took over last night.
- Wait.What about interviewing
Mrs. Matheson?There's nothing I could do.What about the house,
did they follow up on that?It doesn't seem like it.Shit like this always happenswhen we turn it over
to the feds.Don't worry about it.I'm sure they'll send someone
by the next few days.- Next few days?
- Yeah.We found a fucking body
and another one in the house.How many more
do we have to find?Ah! Jesus, just drop it.It's not our case anymore.

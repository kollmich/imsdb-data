Don't quote me. All right?What's your position on

Or is that the other guy?Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.Good people are living in fear.Don't believe everything you hear, son.I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.<i>The Daily Planet</i> criticizing
those who think they're above the lawis a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,you write a puff piece editorialabout an alien who, if he wanted to,could burn the whole place down.There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.<i>Boys! Um!</i>Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!I love it.
I love bringing people together.How are we?- Lex.

we finally got you over to Metropolis.Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.Well, you're welcome.You should hop the harbor
more often, though.I'd love to show you my labs.Maybe we could partner on something.My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.That's seven minutes.<i>Looks like the transfer's complete.</i>- Mr. Luthor.

We haven't been told the truth.Here's the truth.A reporter got greedy for a scoop

but it's not 1938.WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.<i>So apparently Superman</i><i>doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.</i><i>And really, why would we?</i><i>Aside from the red and blue costume.</i><i>And, I don't know, the fact that he has</i><i>one-third of the USA's

before the hearing.</i><i>Do you understand how important this is?</i><i>I cannot let you see the senator.</i><i>Please, I need to speak to her.</i><i>Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!</i><i>This is so important!</i><i>- Come with me.
- Don't touch me!</i>- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.I didn't tell you the truth.C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.The bullet?The metal was developed
by a private company.What company?LexCorp.Lex Luthor?He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.Go on record.Not a chance. It's classified.I happen to like my job.It doesn't make sense.You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...In the middle of the desert. Thank you.The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.And of course the big
unknown in all of this iswill Superman show up?That is what they're really
waiting to see.Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.Soledad O'Brien, <i>In the Moment.</i>Quick question for you.You're heading in
to meet with the senators.What will you tell them?<i>I've come here
to tell them to wake up.</i><i>This is flesh and blood.</i><i>He has delivered a war here.</i><i>And this...</i><i>This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.</i><i>There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.</i><i>He is not a hero.</i>Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?Right now.An anonymous source can verify everythingI told you about what
happened in Nairomi.- An anonymous source?
- Run it.Luthor engineered the desert.It was an ambush for Superman.Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i><i>If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.</i><i>You need proof.</i>No. It needs to run now.<i>Before the hearing.</i><i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>I am not going to risk the paperso that you can pass notes in classto the man that rescued you.<i>He paid her?</i>Not only paid her.
He threatened her.Gave her a script to learn.Her parents are alive back home.But the girl's got a conscience.He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.Senator!Hi, you.Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.Uh, you know what?Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.So what you been up to?I'm just here to tell my story.That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,but a certain junior senator from Kentuckydecided to block it.Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?He is, Mr. Wayne.He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.He returns them.<i>...who lost both his legs</i><i>in those horrific events in Metropolis</i><i>that happened two years ago.</i>Jesus.Why haven't I seen this?<i>I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.</i><i>And there he is. Superman is here.</i><i>He is actually
at the United States Capitol.</i><i>This is really a historic moment.</i><i>Now we expect that Superman will give</i><i>some kind of a statement to the Senate,</i><i>to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.</i>He's here. He came.- He's above the Capitol.
- Ah.You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?It's that power can be innocent.Good luck.Oh, miss...Rudy, she's good to go.Get out!- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witnessfor coming before us today.This is how a democracy works.We talk to each other.We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.<i>I have sat here before
to say that shadow interventions</i><i>will not be tolerated by this committee.</i><i>Neither will lies.</i>Because today is a day for truth.Because only by speaking...Only by working together can we...Can we...Can we create a free, and a...<i>Oh, my God!</i><i>We're back
at the nation's Capitol,</i><i>where something is happening.</i><i>Excuse me.</i>Excuse me, officer.Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?Breathe slowly and deeply.You're gonna be fine.Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.<i>Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.</i>I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.<i>Master Wayne.</i>Mr. Wayne!<i>...in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.</i><i>This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.</i><i>We don't have exact numbers yet,</i><i>but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people</i><i>have died in this explosion.</i><i>First responders are at the scene.</i><i>They are still bringing victims out.</i><i>Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,</i><i>but he seems to have disappeared...</i><i>...raising questions.</i><i>Carrie Birmingham,
reporting live from the nation's capital.</i><i>Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused</i><i>by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.</i><i>Run that one more time for me.</i>- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.<i>Capitol police are confirming to CNN</i><i>that the suspected bomber is</i><i>Wallace Vernon Keefe. Now these sources...</i>Clark, it's me again. Can you...<i>...could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing</i><i>by concealing them inside his wheelchair.</i><i>As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.</i>I didn't see it, Lo.I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.Clark, there are people behind this.I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.All this time,I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.Righting wrongs for a ghost.Thinking I'm here to do good.Superman was never real.Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.That farmer's dream
is all some people have.It's all that gives them hope.This means something.It did on my world.My world doesn't exist anymore.<i>Welcome.</i><i>Analysis reveals ship
operating at 37% efficiency.</i><i>Would you like to assume command?</i>Yes, I would.Yes, I would.<i>Very well. Let's begin.</i><i>The Kryptonian archive contains knowledge
from 100,000 different worlds.</i>Good. Teach me.<i>Alexander Luthor,
your security override has been accepted.</i><i>Genesis Chamber ready
to analyze genetic sample.</i><i>Acknowledging presence
of genetic material.</i><i>Analyzing.</i><i>I've identified the host as
General Zod of Kandor.</i><i>Acknowledging presence

and commencing metamorphosis.</i><i>"And so we are left to wonder</i>"if Superman was aware of
the threat and did nothing,"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"Still no Kent?<i>"His disappearance
raises questions."</i>No.<i>There are still so many
unanswered questions.</i><i>Chief among them,</i><i>whether Superman was involved
in the planning of this attack.</i><i>I mean, here's an individual
who has unlimited power,</i><i>yet did nothing to stop the bomber
just a few feet away from him.</i><i>It just doesn't add up for investigators.</i><i>Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i><i>Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i>For 20 American, he didn't see you.Same for me.<i>Now one FBI official
familiar with this case</i><i>told me they found quote,</i><i>"A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment. "</i><i>What they need to determine now is</i><i>whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.</i><i>And they haven 't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.</i><i>Now, my sources are telling me</i><i>they are getting a barrage of anonymous
and credible tips</i><i>with all roads in this investigation
leading to the Kryptonian visitor.</i>All right, Lois. You gotta go.He didn't know he was gonna die.He just bought groceries.The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desertwere made from the same metal.I know. The desert. The hearing.Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.<i>But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...</i>Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?What do you mean?The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.You couldn't stop it.You couldn't see it.Something, isn't it?We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.Farm at the bottom of the world.I remember one season the water came bad.I couldn't have been 12.Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.We worked till, I think, I fainted.But we managed to stop the water.We saved the farm.Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.We sent it upstream.The whole Lang farm washed away.<i>While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.</i>I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.Did the nightmares ever stop?Yeah.When I met your mother.She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.<i>She was my world.</i>I miss you, son.I miss you too, Dad.You know you can't win this.It's suicide.I'm older now than my father ever was.This may be the only thing
I do that matters.20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.Pull one up, another grows in its place.This is about the future of the world.This is my legacy.My father sat me down right here.Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.Railroads, real estates, and oil.The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.Pelts and skins.They were hunters.So falls the house of Wayne.<i>We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,</i><i>where is he?</i><i>If Superman was not involved,</i><i>if he's got nothing to hide,</i><i>then why hasn 't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?</i><i>You can't point a finger and...</i><i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i><i>If there is going to be a criminal...</i>The night is here.Excuse me.Don't I know...Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.Lois Lane.Mmm. Come see the view.Um... Mmm-mmm.Now the secret to the height
is the building material.It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.Hmm.And you know something
about LexCorp metals,don't you, Miss Lane?I've proven what you've done.Wow, you're feisty.Unfortunately, that will blow away.Like sand in the desert.You're psychotic.That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.Hmm. Next category: circles.Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.The shortest distance
between any two pointsis a straight path.And I believe
the straightest path to Supermanis a pretty little road...Mmm. Called Lois Lane.You came back.You came back.Boy, do we have problems up here!The problem of... Of evil in the world.Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.I'll take you in without breaking you.Which is more than you deserve.The problem of you
on top of everything else.You above all.Ah, because that's what God is.Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.Clark Joseph Kent.See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.Because God is tribal. God takes sides.No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boyto deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.I figured out way back,if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.And neither can you be.They need to see the fraud you are.With their eyes.The blood on your hands.What have you done?Hmm. And tonight, they will.Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.Across the bay.Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.Little red notes, big bang.You let your family die!<i>And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.</i>To the death.Black and blue. Fight Night!The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.God versus man.Day versus night.Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.You think I'll fight him for you?Hmm, yes, I do.I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.She's safe on the ground. How about you?Close, but I am not talking about Lois.No.Every boy's special lady is his mother.Martha, Martha, Martha.Hmm.Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.The punishment for witches, what is that?That's right. Death by fire.Mmm.Where is she?I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.But if you kill the Bat...Martha lives.There we go. There we go. Hmm.And now God bends to my will.Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.For the world to see
the holes in the holy.Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.To save Martha,bring me the head of the Bat.Ah.Mother of God, would you look at the time?When you came here, you had an hour.Now it's less.<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i><i>Brooke, you're live on the air.

the city remains in the dark tonight.</i><i>Much chaos.</i><i>Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i><i>Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.</i><i>I don't know if you can

Put it on the goddamn roof.On the roof, Lois!Where are we headed?There!<i>Well, here I am.</i>Bruce. Please.I was wrong. You have to listen to me.Lex wants us to...You don't understand.There's no time!<i>I understand.</i>Stay down!If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.<i>Breathe it in.</i><i>That's fear.</i><i>You're not brave.</i><i>Men are brave.</i><i>I bet your parents taught you

Why did you say that name?</i>Clark! Stop!Please! Stop!<i>Why did you say that name?</i>It's his mother's name!It's his mother's name.<i>We're not getting any answers.</i>We're still right outside
the containment center.A dangerous situation.Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.<i>Luthor.</i>He wanted your life for hers.She's losing time.The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.It's got to be Lex.<i>They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.</i>- My mother needs me.
- Wait.<i>I'll make you a promise.</i><i>Martha won't die tonight.</i><i>Master Wayne.</i><i>Alfred.</i>Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phoneto a warehouse near the port.<i>You're locked onto it.</i><i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>No, sir. You don't.I'm afraid this is goodbye.And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.- Take it down.
- Go! Go!<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>Ah, right.Commencing drone mode.Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.Why don't I drop you off on the second?Drop it.I said drop it!I'll kill her.Believe me, I'll do it.<i>I believe you.</i><i>It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.</i>I figured.The cape."Late, late," says the White Rabbit.<i>Forty seconds to animation.</i>Right, wabbit?Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.And one Bat head short.<i>Thirty seconds to animation.</i>Ah. That'll be the cook. Excuse me.Uh, Gotham Roast. Well done.Hello. Break the bad news.<i>I'd rather do

<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>And yours, my friend, is existing.I cannot let you win.I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.So, if man won't kill God...<i>...two, one.</i>...the devil will do it!Perry!All right. Stay calm, everybody!<i>We're getting reports

Daddy, you know what I saw?It's the most fantastic thing.Come look.My son.Look, son, I'm really busy...but I'll tell you what I do need.I need some good luck.<i>Okay?</i><i>Okay, Mr. Lucky, I think it's time...</i>we divvy up the loot.Look at all of these things.
What a night!What do you think of this?
This is pretty. I better take those.Try that. Isn't that pretty?I better keep that.
That's pretty nice.<i>I think I'd better take that.
Let me see.</i>No, you shouldn't have that.I better take that.
You're a little too young for that.Oh, look at that watch.
I better take that.That's a pretty watch.I think it's about time
I got myself another knife...so I oughta give you this.You never know when a knife
might come in handy.<i>You want some gold?
There's lots of gold.</i><i>You know...</i>I'll bet this is
the most valuable piece here.It's Bucephalus...the magic horse
of Alexander the Great.<i>A long time ago, this king
was going to kill Bucephalus...</i><i>because he was so wild
the king couldn't ride him.</i>He had Bucephalus brought
into a big arena...and people came from all around...'cause they wanted
to see this horse...that was the biggest
and blackest and strongest...the most beautiful horse
that ever was.<i>King Phillip goes walking out there...</i><i>and he looked right at his men.</i><i>He said, "Kill that horse."</i><i>Just then, a voice called out
from the crowd.</i>It said, "I can ride that horse."Everybody looked around.
They said, "Who said that?"They looked over,
and it was a kid...<i>just about your size,
just about your age.</i>And King Phillip
looked over and he said..."Son, if you can ride that horse...you can <i>have</i> that horse."
Hmm?So Alexander walked out
into the big arena...and standing in the middle
of the arena was Bucephalus.<i>He was big, and he was strong...</i>and he was pawing the ground.And there was fire in his eyes...and there was smoke
coming out of his nose...and he went â<i>Alexander walked up...</i>and quick as a cat
he jumped up on his back...and grabbed that long black mane...and away they went
just like lightning.They jumped right over the crowd,
all the way over the stand...and went riding out over the hill.Everybody said, "Whew."Smoke coming out of his nose!And fire in his eyes.<i>- Fire in his eyes!</i>
- Well, that's the way I heard the story.Here. I want you to have this.Bucephalus.Dad?<i>Dad, what's going on?</i>- Ow!
<i>- Alec!</i><i>Alec, come here!</i>Just take it easy. We'll be okay.- What's happening?
- I don't know. Put this on.Help me with this.
Come here, son. Put this life vest on.It's okay. Tie the bottom.Tie the bottom. Ow!Let's get out of here.Hang on to that rail!Stay right there!Right there! I'll be back.Stay there!<i>I'm going to go help.
Don't move! Hang on!</i><i>- Help!</i>
- Hey, Alec!Dad!Help!Dad!<i>Alec!</i>Dad!Alec!Help!Help!Help!Help!Aah!Hey! Hey!He saved my life.I can't leave the island
without him.<i>He'll die without me.</i>Black!Black!<i>Let me go!</i><i>Black!</i>Black, come on!Black!"Ode to Alec Ramsey.I think that I shall never see...a boy as brave as Alec Ramsey.Hunger and thirst
and fear and pain...<i>he lived because his heart had aim.</i>A horse as black as night to day...<i>a beast, a god...</i><i>with whom he did stay.</i><i>They slept on the sand
and played in the ocean...</i><i>and rode over the island
in a singular motion.</i><i>Now here he sits,
a hero among boys...</i><i>with the love of a horse...</i><i>much more than mere toys."</i>I'm very happy
to have my son back.<i>Thank you.</i><i>I wish you could have
saved his father too.</i>You're kind of a pretty horse.Aah!Aah!Black!Black, no!<i>Black!</i>No!Black, come back!<i>Alec!</i>Whoa!Wow!Yes, I saw a black horse!
He ran thataway!Whoa, whoa, whoa.<i>Hey!</i>What happened to you?- Everything.
<i>- "Everything"?</i>That's a whole lot.Can't be everything.Oh, you lost a black horse.Yeah, yeah!
Have you seen him?<i>Do you know where he is?</i>Napoleon...didn't you tell me
you saw a black stallion?Well, what did he say?He says,
"Well, not very far from here."Just past the dairy...there's a big black barn.Then you see
a long bunch of skinny trees...as you walk along.<i>And then you go
right by a morning star...</i><i>and you keep following that star...</i><i>and see a large patch
of green grass.</i><i>Then you stop,
and then you listen...</i><i>and pretty soon you see
just what you been lookin' for.</i>Hey, Black!Black?Aah!Black!Black, it's you!You okay? I knew it was you!What do you think
you're doing over there, sonny?I'm getting my horse!And you're a big fat thief!- Nobody's a thief.
<i>- You are!</i>I said nobody's a thief!Who do you think you're calling a thief?
This is my place...and I'm thinking
that that's my horse.No-ho-ho! He's mine.Hold on, son.Wait a minute.
You hold on there.Now, what are you
gonna do here, buddy?What are you gonna do?Easy, easy.Well, maybe he is yours.But you know
I spent all last night...trying to catch
this wild horse here? Huh?<i>All night I spent.</i>You're just lucky I got him
instead of the police.Hear me?He kicked a garbageman?- Yeah.
- He's something, all right.Hey, did you have any breakfast?Henry...I think he likes it out here.<i>Tried cows. That didn't work.</i>5:00 in the morning.Chickens.They just about drove me nuts,
those chickens.Look, if you clean this stall up
in here real good...and you get it fit for him,
I could let you have it.Red cards, red cards.
I've got too many red cards.Henry, is the Black fast?He's fast.Fast enough to be a racehorse?Alec, that Black is a desert horse.He's fast, all right.
Sure he's fast.But he hasn't got any papers.Fast or not, I don't think
they'd ever let him run.Henry, can I ask you a question?Sure.Why did you stop training?I got tired.Do you think you'll ever...try it again?Sure I do.Sure.It's work.Worth it â
Worth it, though.<i>Hold on to him good, son!
Stay in the center!</i><i>Turn him around the other way.</i>The other way, son.
Bring him in and turn him around.<i>Now send him down around here!</i><i>Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!</i><i>It comes as no surprise
that again this week...</i><i>both Sun Raider,
the fiery red stallion from the west...</i><i>and Cyclone,
the sleek gray from the east...</i><i>have won their races with ease,</i><i>and they have won
with monotonous regularity.</i><i>But â hey, hey! â</i><i>let's see these two champions
run head-to-head...</i><i>and perhaps horse fans would be treated
to the match race of the century.</i><i>This is â hey, hey! â</i><i>Jim Neville from Belmont.</i>Looking this way.
Not this way, down on the ground.Looking straight ahead.
That's right.Hyah! Hyah!To see what's coming in back,
look under your arm.Not over your shoulder.
Down under here. See in here?See what's going on
down there all around you.And you can scoot and boot,
understand?<i>Then you've got your balance.</i>Keep your knees in close
when putting your stirrups on.Check down underneath here too.Get that leather out of your way.Pull it back in there underneath...so that your knees
got nothing in the way.Okay, now you're up.Feel that in your legs? Hmm?- Feel it pulling on your legs back here?
- Uh-huh.Okay.
Look ahead down the lane.No, you don't jump
straight up and down.Just try and keep your body
as still as possible.He'll be moving, see.
He'll be making that rhythm.Just go on with him.No, you don't have to pump him.Just kind of go
straight ahead with him, huh?No, like you're throwing it away.
Like this.Throw it away. That's right.Throw it away.When a horse
starts out of that gate...you've got to remember this:You don't want him to outbreak you.You know what that means?
That horse starts to settle.They open that gate â wham! âlike that, and some of them
just scat â whap!So you grab a handful of mane...just before he says "go,"
so he don't outbreak you.Because they open that gate,
and you'll just be sitting in midair.Understand?- This Black can outbreak you.
- Right.He can move right on out there.<i>You know, Alec...</i>secrecyâthat's the key word.Yeah. Okay.Don't just say "okay."
Know what I'm talking about.It's a secret.<i>You and me, we have a secret.</i>Listen to me.
We'll make this a real easy workout.- All right.
- Get him used to this place.Jake and I will be
over here with Napoleon.Go down to the half-mile pole
and watch me...and I'll give you the start
by dropping my hat.I want you to work him
for a half mile...then breeze him for a half mile,
then pull him up nice and easy.- Go to the half-mile pole and watch me.
- Okay.Come on, let's go!Too much horse for your boy.Jake, he's gonna be all right.Come on, Nappy. Let's go.Whoa.Go on, Nap!
Go on, get him!<i>Pull him up!</i><i>Pull him up, Nappy!</i><i>On the inside! Pull him up!</i>Come on, Jake.Hey, your hands â
You all right there?Yeah, I'm okay.- Henry, I better walk him now.
- All right, go ahead.Cool him off, son.Did you get what I got?Right on the button.Jake, that horse has got speed
he ain't even tapped yet.Well, you're not, uh âYou're not thinking âYou are out of your mind!That monster has no more business
being out on this track with class âHe's fast, but he's wild!You saw him zigzagging
all over the course.And what about his papers?- He ain't got any.
- He ain't âWhat are you going to do,
hitch him up to a plow?<i>No.</i><i>I got an idea.</i>A match race? Cyclone?Oh, you â you are too much!You are really too much!You got me thinking
kinda crazy too.Squeeze my hand.
I want to try something here.You feel that?
That's a pretty good grip.Not bad. But we're going
to have to work on your grip.When I was a rider,
I used to use this ball.- What does the ball do?
- Strengthens your hands.No matter what you're doing
through the day, just use this ball.Let me see you do it.Next time you grip my hand,
we'll see a difference.<i>This reporter has the hottest racing
news of the year. Hold on to your hats.</i><i>The most sensational
match race imaginable...</i><i>between Cyclone from the east
and Sun Raider from the west...</i><i>is finally set for the afternoon
of August 15 at Santa Anita.</i><i>They'll go over two grueling miles
to prove...</i><i>which is really
the greatest champion.</i><i>This is â hey, hey! â
Jim Neville from Belmont.</i><i>Well, whoever you are...</i><i>here we go.</i>It's open.Sure is quiet in here today.<i>Anything wrong with that?</i>The Black, he âhe just wouldn't play.He just stands there...and looks out into the rain.<i>Maybe the Black is blue today.</i><i>- You ever think of that?</i>
- Blue?Rain, man, rain.Rain, see?We're gonna show everybody...he's the fastest horse in the world.You think you know that animal?Yeah, I know him.Well...I don't know.Hmm.I get a funny feeling.I feel right now...that you better let that horse
stay wild, Alec.It's his soul.Easy, Black.Easy.- He ain't gonna show.
- I don't want to hear that.He'll show. He'll show.
He'll be here.He probably doesn't
even remember us.- He'll be here.
- We're ancient history.I tell you, he's gonna be here.- He's busy.
<i>- He's a little jumpy, Henry.</i>Come on, work him.
Get him out there.Henry! You okay?- Where'd he get you?
- Yeah. On my arm.- Here? It's not broken, is it?
- On myâ<i>No! Leave it alone!
He just nicked me.</i>Will you please stop âAll right, all right.What?It's him.- It's him.
- No.It's him, by God.I tell you, it's him.- Yeah, it's him!
- Take it easy.<i>It's him.</i>All right, all right.Give him a leg up there.
All right.<i>All right, Alec.</i>Remember:
This is our big chance.It's up to you.All right, take him out.Come on, bring him on!<i>Come on!</i>- Hey!
- Hey, he's out cold.<i>Get him out of that mane.
Hold him steady, will you?</i><i>You got him?
Give me your knife.</i><i>- I got it.
- Watch it! Hold him steady.</i><i>- Whoa.
- Whoa, sonny.</i><i>- Gimme the knife.
- Here.</i>Where'd you get this animal?Get him off.Whoa, boy.- Get him out over there.
- I got him.Watch yourself.
Watch it, sir.<i>Whoa, boy. Hyah!</i>What happened?
Did I fall off?<i>No.</i>No, you hung on like a champ.What happened?
Where's the Black?Don't worry about him.
He's fine.He's over in the van with Nappy.He did good, didn't he?<i>You did great.</i>You did great.<i>You all right?</i>- How did you like what you saw?
- Well, I wasn't disappointed.<i>"Disappointed"? Come on!</i><i>You never saw a horse
run like that in your life.</i>This could put you
back in the action, huh, Dailey?Don't try to get hard with me.
You know, Neville...I need this race.<i>I need it bad,
and you can do it.</i>Huh? Will you do it?<i>If that horse goes like that
with a kid...</i><i>- what will he do with a real rider
like Macorello?
- The race!</i>Nice going, kid. You got guts.<i>You heard me say that Cyclone and
Sun Raider are the fastest horses today.</i><i>Well, I've seen another horse...</i><i>that defies the imagination,
that runs like a demon possessed...</i><i>at night, alone,
at speeds beyond belief.</i><i>He's never won a race,
but I say he could be...</i><i>the greatest sensation
in racing history.</i><i>So I challenge the owners...</i><i>of Cyclone and Sun Raider
to meet this mystery horse...</i><i>in their upcoming match race.
This isn't a joke, folks.</i><i>This mystery horse is real.
I'll stake my reputation on it.</i><i>This is â hey, hey! â
Jim Neville from Belmont.</i><i>Do you know any good jockeys?
Real good, famous jockeys?</i>There's a lot of them.
George Wolf, the Iceman.- "Iceman"?
- That's just what they call him.Georgie Wolf. They call him
in the newspapers "the Iceman"...because he sits
chilly on a horse.That means he sits there,
and he can wait. He's studying a horse.He's up there riding...going on with him,
know what I mean?He's sitting up there going on...just studying him.Just studying him.Then, when it's time
to make his move, he'll say..."Ah! Here comes the Iceman."Hmm.Mom, do you want me
to mow the lawn...or wash the dishes or something?<i>Sure. Yeah.</i>Why don't you make all the beds
and vacuum in here too?- Mom, have you read this?
- What is it?Oh, this is more
about that mystery horse, isn't it?Boy!Remember last year
when they were giving away...<i>aluminum ballpoint pens for this â</i>The Black is the mystery horse....the lengths they will go
to get people...to go to a horse race.<i>And I'm gonna ride him.</i>I'll get it!<i>What did you say?
Wait, Alec.</i>Alec, wait one more second.
Say that again.The Black is the mystery horse,
and I'm going to ride him.That is not the mystery horse.<i>And even if he were,
you're not going to ride him.</i>It was a secret.
I told you as soon as I could.You're not supposed
to keep secrets from your mother.Someone's at the door.I know!- Mrs. Ramseyâ
- Oh!The Black is the mystery horse...and you're going
to ride him in a race.Oh, well.Well, well, well!Isn't this just
fascinating timing?What's been going on
between you guys and that horse?I'd like to know. I have a right.I guess you've been
talking to Alec.I have been trying to!
Would you like to tell me
something about this?- I'd be happy to.
<i>- Come in, please!</i>Well, it's, uh, quite a...quite a long story,
Mrs. Ramsey.I'm sure,
but you've got to be kidding.You think I'm going
to let him ride in a race?<i>My son could get killed
in a horse race!</i><i>I think you could be
exaggerating a little.</i><i>I'm not exaggerating.
Don't lie to me, Mr. Dailey.</i><i>- You're willing to risk his life? I'm not!
- Mrs. Ramsey â</i><i>I've lost a husband,
and I'm not going to lose a son.</i><i>I wouldn't hurt that boy
for anything in the world.</i><i>What kind of dreams
are you filling up his head with?</i><i>It's much more than just a race.</i><i>Your son has his heart set on it.</i><i>Good-bye, Mr. Dailey.</i><i>Good-bye, Mrs. Ramsey.</i>So what happened to the new deal, huh?
The clean slate?Alec, I can't let you do it.I can't let you ride
in that horse race. It's ridiculous.I'm sorry.What is that?Alexander the Great's horse.Dad gave it to me.Just before the storm.It reminds me of...the Black and me.Alexander's father gave it to him...before he died.I was in the water.I couldn't breathe.It was dark, and...I...I yelled out for Dad, but âI looked up...and there was the Black...and I grabbed on to him.He saved your life, didn't he?Oh, Alec.What am I going to do?I gotta ride.Okay, Alec.<i>That Neville would do
anything for publicity, huh?</i><i>I'll bet the mystery horse
don't even show.</i><i>No one can beat him.
I'll beat him.</i><i>I heard Mendoza's gonna come in.</i>Who's missing from the room?- That beats him right there.
- Who rides him, I wonder.<i>Where'd that guy get them silks at?</i><i>Looks like he's ready for Halloween.</i>Rider number one up.- Number one, sir.
- Number one, add two pounds.Got that, George?Rider number two now.<i>Thank you.</i>Rider number three.Number three?How do I look?<i>Number three, please.</i>- I don't think he's gonna show.
- It's been a joke.Rider number three!Well!The mystery rider.Hop on the scale.- He won't be strong enough to go two miles.
- No way. Too small.<i>- Rider on the scale, please.
- He's on the scale, sir.</i><i>He's on the scale?</i>Add it on.Okay. All right.Okay, take him out.All right, bring him out.<i>...Sun Raider, owned by Mr. Steve Walsh...</i><i>ridden by Doug Claybourne.</i><i>And the black mystery horse...</i><i>is in number three, owned and ridden...</i><i>by Alexander Ramsey.</i><i>Two miles. They'll come by the stands
one time and around again.</i><i>The stands are jammed
for what's considered a match race...</i><i>between the champion
of the east, Cyclone...</i><i>and the champion of the west,
Sun Raider.</i><i>The excitement centers
on the mystery horse.</i><i>It looks like a match race
between these two champions.</i><i>Cyclone and Sun Raider
are going two miles.</i><i>The black horse is in there â</i>He's moving
on the mystery horse!Gate that one.Whoa! Settle down!Settle! Whoa!Stop! Whoa!Stop!Stop, Black!Stop!There's some problem
with the mystery horse!Cyclone keeping the pace.Come on!They're in the far turn now.<i>That a boy!</i>He's won!
The mystery horse won!He won! He won!This, ladies and gentlemen âHe won! He won!He won!This horse has got a leg like iron.It's going to be all right, son.Henry!

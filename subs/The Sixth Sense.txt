association writing is, Cole?</i><i>[Cole] No.</i><i>[Malcolm] Free association writing

think about what you're writing.</i><i>You just keep
your hand moving.</i><i>And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough,</i><i>words and thoughts start coming out that

free association writing, Cole?</i><i>[Cole] Yes.</i><i>[Malcolm] What did you write?</i>Upset words.<i>Did you ever write any upset words

in your life, anything at all,what would it be?Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?Okay.I don't want to be

It's the city you live in.- [All Together] Philadelphia!

in this country.A lot of generations
have lived here and died here.<i>Almost anyplace you go in this city
has a history and a story behind it.</i>Even this school

not correct. Where'd you hear that?They pulled the people in, crying
and kissing their families bye.People watching...
spit at them.Uh, Cole, this building
was a legal courthouse.Laws were passed here... some of
the very first laws of this country.This whole building
was full of, uh, lawyers,<i>- lawmakers.

that hanged everybody.</i><i>[Children Whispering, Giggling]</i>Uh...I don't know which one

how else to look.You're Stuttering Stanley!- Excuse me?

you went to school here.You talked funny
all the way to high school.<i>- What?

of the magic trick.I do another
little shake, and...right there
in the vest pocket.But that's not the end
of the magic trick.I do another little shake...and...right back in the left hand
where it started.That isn't magic.What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.<i>You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.</i>Think so?I didn't know you were funny.<i>## [Pop]</i><i>[Woman] Malcolm, sit your cute
butt down and listen up.</i>No doubt about it.

kind of happy.<i>That's the kind of happy
I'm talkinÂ’ about.</i><i>Shh. Come here.</i>Don't tell her I told you,but she said
she knew she love you...from the first time
she met you on the street.<i>[Sobbing]
She'd do anything for you.</i><i>I love you guys.</i>[Sniffles]My nose is running.
Turn it...<i>[Shower Water Running]</i><i>## [Rock]</i>[Chattering]And then you do
the magic shake.The penny has moved

tell you bedtime stories?Once upon a time
there was this young prince,<i>and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.</i><i>He got his driver,
and they started driving.</i>Driving, driving.[Sighs]
Driving a lot.And, uh,they drove so much
that he fell asleep.<i>And...</i>Then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.<i>- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?</i>You haven't told
bedtime stories before.Uh, not too many, no.You have to add
some twists and stuff.Okay. Some twists.<i>Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.</i><i>- Maybe they run out of gas.
- They run out of gas?</i>That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so...Tell me the story
about why you're sad.You think I'm sad?What makes you think that?Your eyes told me.Not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.<i>Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.</i>He worked with children.He loved it.He loved it
more than anything else.And then one night,
he found out that...he made a mistake
with one of them.<i>He couldn't help that one.</i><i>And he can't stop
thinking about it.</i>He can't forget.Ever since then,
things have been different.<i>He's not the same person
that he used to be.</i>And his wife...doesn't like the person
that he's become.They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.<i>And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.</i><i>A really cool little boy.</i>Reminds him a lot
of the other one.And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,it will be like...
helping that other one too.[Whispering]
How does the story end?I don't know.[Whispering] I wanna tell you
my secret now.Okay.I see dead people.In your dreams?While you're awake?Dead people, like,
in graves, in coffins?Walking around
like regular people.<i>They don't see each other.</i><i>They only see
what they wanna see.</i>They don't know they're dead.How often do you see them?All the time.<i>They're everywhere.</i><i>You won't tell anyone

sucked big time?</i>[Chuckles]
What?Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.He said everyone was self-conscious

sucked big time.This Tommy kid sounds
like a real punk.<i>I thought the play was excellent.
Better than "Cats."</i>- "Cats"?
- Never mind.Cole, I was really interested
in what you told me at the hospital.I'd like to hear
more about it.Cole?What?Is something
up there?Cole,I don't
see anything.Be real still.Sometimes you
feel it inside,like you're falling down
real fast,but you're really
just standing still.You ever feel the prickly things
on the back of your neck?Yes.And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?Yes.That's them.When they get mad,it gets cold.I don't see anything.

this thing is broken.Take 'em off.I don't want them

when I was cleaning.Got something
you want to confess?Hmm?
The bumblebee pendant?Why do you
keep taking it?It was Grandma's.You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.<i>You'd cry 'cause you
miss Grandma so much.</i>That's right.Sometimes people think
they lose things,and they really didn't lose them...
it just gets moved.So, did you move
the bumblebee pendant?Don't get mad.So, who moved it
this time?Maybe someone came in our house,
took the bumblebee pendant
out of my closet...and placed it nicely
in your drawer.<i>- Maybe.
- [Sighs] God, I am so tired, Cole.</i>I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind,I'm... tired
in my heart.I need some help.You know, I don't know if you
noticed, but our little family
isn't doing so good.I mean,
I've been praying,but I must not
be praying right.Looks like we're just gonna have to
answer each other's prayers.If we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.Now, tell me, baby.
I-I-I won't get mad, honey.Did you take
the bumblebee pendant?<i>- No.

- [Door Closes, Bells Jingling]</i>You, uh...

Is that how it is?No! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.Uh...
You're so beautiful.You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.Why don't you
try it on...and see how you both
feel about it.There. How does
that feel?I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.I imagine that the woman
who owned it...loved a man that she
couldn't be with.Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,like...
like fingerprints.I'll just
wrap it up.You don't need a guy
with a Master's.You need a wrestler with a neck

No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.- What's this?

think about it, Cole.I want you to think about it
really carefully.What do you think
they want?- Just help.
- That's right. That's what I think too.They just want help,
even the scary ones.I think I might know a way
to make them go away.How?Listen to them.What if they
don't want help?What if they're just angry and they
just want to hurt somebody?I don't think
that's the way it works.How do you know
for sure?I don't.<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>- [Engine Starts]

some water?That's her sister.<i>You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer...</i>I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.<i>[Woman] How many...
How many doctors?</i><i>- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?</i><i>I think so, yes.</i><i>I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.</i>God help them.Don't go home,

[Panting]Mister?Excuse me, mister.Are you
Kyra's daddy?It's for you.Sh-She wanted
to tell you something.[Static][Kyra's Voice] Oh, no, here he comes.

if I eat this?I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.<i>We'll see.</i><i>Don't say that it tastes funny.

keeping her sick.You liked it,
she said.<i>She looked out
for you.</i>Is Kyra coming back?<i>[Cole] Not anymore.</i><i>[Woman] I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.</i><i>[Cole] Okay.</i>- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry!Who, uh...
Who were you talking to?Just practicing
my lines.<i>Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.</i>You know, when I went to school
here, there was a terrible fire
in this section of the theater.They rebuilt
the whole thing.Yeah, I know.[Audience Sighing]Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.Let the boy try.<i>[Scattered Applause]</i>He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.<i>- Silence, village idiot.

really great in the play, Cole.</i><i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i><i>- You know what else?

sucked big time. [Chuckles][Chuckles]<i>I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.</i>Wait till
she's asleep.Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I?I think we said everything
we needed to say.<i>Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.</i>Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.Just for pretend.Okay.<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.- [Siren Blaring]
- [Chattering, Indistinct]I'm okay, Officer.

what happened.</i>[Lynn] Hmm.Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.You're very quiet.You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?I have two jobs, baby.You know how important
they are for us.[Sighs]I'd give anything
to have been there.I'm ready to communicate
with you now.Communicate?Tell you my secrets.What is it?You know the accident
up there?Yeah.Someone got hurt.They did?A lady.She died.Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?- Yes.
- Where is she?Standing next to
my window.Cole, you're
scaring me.They scare me too
sometimes.They?Ghosts.You see ghosts, Cole?They want me to
do things for them.They...
They talk to you?<i>They tell you
to do things?</i><i>They're the ones
that used to hurt me.</i><i>What are you
thinking, Mama?</i>- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.I would never think that
about you. Ever.<i>- Got it?
- Got it.</i>Just let me think
for a minute.Grandma says hi.<i>She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.</i><i>She just
likes it a lot.</i>- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.Cole, that's
very wrong.<i>- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.</i>- She wanted me to tell you...
- Cole, please stop.She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.<i>She said
when you were little,</i><i>you and her
had a fight...</i>right before
your dance recital.<i>- [Sniffles]
- You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.</i>She did.<i>She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.</i><i>Sh-She said you were
like an angel.</i><i>- [Sobbing]
- She said...</i>you came to the place
where they buried her,asked her a question.She said
the answer is...every day.<i>What did you ask?</i>[Sniffles][Voice Breaking]Do...Do I make her proud?[Sobbing]
Mama.[Sobbing]<i>[Laughing, Chattering]</i><i>[Man] Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,</i><i>I'm not
used to doing this,</i>and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.<i>I'll leave that to her mother.
[Chuckles]</i><i>But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...</i><i>and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.</i><i>It's bittersweet almost,
for me,</i><i>'cause I hate
giving her up.</i><i>[Malcolm] Anna?</i><i>[Applause On Television]</i>I miss you.I miss you too.Why, Malcolm?What?- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?I didn't leave you.<i>[Object Clatters]</i><i>[Cole] I see people.</i>They don't know
they're dead.<i>- [Malcolm] How often
do you see them?
- [Cole] All the time.</i><i>[Cole] They're everywhere.</i><i>They only see
what they want to see.</i><i>[Malcolm On TV] Okay, Mikey.</i>Come on.
Give me a minute.<i>[Doorknob Turning]</i>[Panting][Exhales Deeply][Shivering]<i>[Gunshot]</i><i>[Anna Screams]</i><i>[Whimpering]</i>- Oh, God.

Really, I think it just went...went in and out.It doesn't even
hurt anymore.I think
I can go now.I just needed
to do a couple things.I needed
to help someone.I think I did.And I needed
to tell you something.You were never second.Ever.<i>I love you.</i>You sleep now.Everything will be
different in the morning.Good night,
Malcolm.Good night,
sweetheart.

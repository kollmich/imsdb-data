with the Aretas cartel.<i>Sorenson.</i><i>Weber.</i><i>Vargas. Carver.</i>All of the victims
were on that case.This is revenge.Yeah, Mike, but you
weren't on that case.My name wasn't on it.That's how deep I was.I was Ricky Rollins.Benito Aretas.He's dead, Mike.
He ain't after you.Not him.His wife.Isabel.I was her driver.We connected so... deep.We talked about everything.
She showed me the whole game.How to walk it, how to talk it,
put clothes on it.She made Mike Lowrey.- We fell in love.

the one time that you...?Isabel Aretas.The one time.Takedown was coming.
DEA, ATF, everybody.And I was gonna ghost
the whole operation.Me and Isabel were gonna
run away with each other.What made you change your mind?They call her <i>La Bruja.</i>The Witch.[PRAYING IN SPANISH]MIKE:
<i>She is into some dark shit.</i><i>Santa Muerte.</i>That woman...was a stone-cold killer.<i>So I had to put
the woman I love</i><i>behind bars

choosing it ever since.Mike, you fucked
a married witch?So all the shit I just said,

you know somebody and...Well, hell, now it explains why
you dress like a drug dealer.So you wanna hear
this shit or you don't?Sorry. But you don't know
that's your son, Mike.You don't know
who that witch was fucking.Benito Aretas
couldn't have kids.Isabel gave birth in prison,
eight months after her arrest.<i>"Hasta el fuego."</i>
He said that to mebefore I jumped
from the chopper.<i>Me and Isabel made that up.</i><i>It's not even real Spanish.</i><i>It's some shit
we said to each other.</i><i>It meant like, "We'll be
together until we burn."</i>[IN SPANISH]

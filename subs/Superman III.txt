Talk about fast.Those people are crazy. They expect

Your drink is on its way.WOMAN:
Sir.Excuse me......but what if you wanna program two
bilateral coordinates at the same time?You can't do that. It's impossible.WOMAN: But if you can't--
-Oh, no.Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.WOMAN: But if you think we can't
do it that way, what happens--?GUS:
Sir.TEACHER:
Good Lord.How did you do that?I don't know. l just did it.PERRY: Who's this?
JlMMY: That's him, Ross Webster.JlMMY: Just after he received the award for
Humanitarian of the Year.He is good-looking.Because I gave him f.2 at a 50th.One thing I don't understand......the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor......and you bring me one picture of him
and 1 5 pictures of this other person.PERRY: Who is she?
-Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's--She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.PERRY: Who's this other woman?
JlMMY: His sister, Vera Webster.PERRY: Picture looks fuzzy.
-What?The picture's fine, chief.
She looks like that in real life.-She's VP of Webscoe lndustries.
-l really don't understand you.A boring banquet and you bring me
3000 boring pictures.Yet Superman saves a man
from drowning on Third Avenue......while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture!Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.-l'm glad I'm a writer.
-Mr. White, please.It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.-l don't know why the idiot in Circulation--
CLARK: Good morning.-Hi, Clark.
-Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.You've got mustard on your lapel.Excuse me, Mr. White,
I hate to interrupt--Sorry. l'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.It'll never replace the printing press.-What's the number, Mr. White?
-Fifty-three.-Mr. White--
SECRETARY: Fifty-three!CLARK: Mr. White--
-You've got to pull three more numbers.I promised l'd call them back today.
What do you think?-Well, l don't know, Kent--
-l think it'd make a terrific story.What's a terrific story?Kent's been invited
to his high-school reunion.-Say.
CLARK: Yeah.Could we have the next number?It's practically an
American institution. lsn't it?I don't know, Mr. Kent. Most of
the people l know are still in high school.Thirty-three.What l thought this story
would be about, Mr. White, is--SECRETARY:
Thirty-three.--is how much the typical small town
has changed in the last 1 5 years.Take me, for example:Can l really go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate?I'm really excited about this.
In fact, l was looking around......in my closet last night......and l even found
my old high-school sweater.-Smallville.
-Mr. White.Can l go ahead
and make my travel plan?Same question about mine.Tell your people the prodigal son
and his photographer are coming home.Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.-That's okay.
-You deserve the vacation, Lois.Thank you.Lois, are you going someplace?Clark, you know some people
get to go all the way to Smallville......and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.Golly.LOIS: Bye.
JlMMY: Bye, Miss Lane.-Have fun.
-Mr. White, the next number, please.Well, l guess I better be going too.So l'll be going.Bye.Couldn't we get a computer to do this?-Hey, what is this?
-First paycheck.This is the first rip-off, man! We're
supposed to get 225 a week, right?This says, "$143.80."
How am l supposed to live on that?State tax, federal tax,
social security tax--It's so you're still getting
some money when you hit 65.So l'm getting money when l--? 65?I want mine now!I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
I wanna get up and get down. Boogie.Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?Everybody loses those fractions?They don't lose them.
You can't lose what you never got.Then what happens?
The company gets them?They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.Then what happens to them?Well, they're just floating around out there.
The computers know where.How many sugars?One and a half.It's quitting time, Gus. You coming?Yeah. No, actually, l got some
stuff to finish up, so....Working overtime, huh? What are you
doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?Yeah, looking for a raise.GUS:
You bet.JlMMY: But my Uncle Al on my father's
side, he won't eat her stuffing.He says it should be cooked on the outside.
She cooks it on the inside.My mother told my Aunt Helen.
She's my father's half sister.-l told you that, right?
-Yeah.-And anyway, the family--
-Hey, hey.-Look at that.
JlMMY: Wow.[SIRENS WAlL]Okay, your choice:
You can turn back or pull over till it's over.-How long will it take?
-Can't tell with these fires.I mean, that fire--
That's spreading like wildfire.DRIVER:
It's just a building burning.It's not just a building.
That's a chemical plant.You know what l mean.
It's like-- lt's like chemicals.If any of that stuff goes up in smoke,
we're in for a hairy time around here.-Clark.
-Yeah?I want you to keep
these people distracted.What are you doing?What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?A photographer always
goes after a story.That could be dangerous, Jimmy.Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.[FlREMEN SHOUT INDISTINCTLY]Help me!-How can I help?
-Get this man a helmet.-lt's you. Forget the helmet.
-How bad is it?My God, it's a nightmare. Everything's
either explosive or flammable or worse.[EXPLOSlON]Get the ladder truck in here.-lt won't reach.
-My God, they're trapped!What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?[WORKERS YELL]Let's go! Everybody,
down there! Move it!Come on! Hurry up!There you go.Right down there. Take it easy.All right. Everybody down there!MAN:
Keep moving!Sir, get out. l'll show you
the quickest way.Go on. Look after the others.
I can't leave.-Why not?
-l gotta stay and look after those.That's concentrated Beltric acid.If that stuff heats up over 1 80 degrees,
we've got a crisis......that'll make this fire
look like a picnic.SUPERMAN:
What does it do?CHEMlST: As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that will eat through anything.Steel, concrete, anything.[FlREMEN SHOUT INDISTINCTLY]Who the hell is that?FIREMAN: Hey, you! Get off of there!
-l'm just gonna get a couple more shots.Ow! Ah!Tell them to bring their hoses
back here! Quickly!JlMMY:
Help!Help! Help me!Help! Somebody help me!-Help!

All right? Here we go.Medics! Over here, please.That's it. Here you go.Go easy. lt's the left leg.-My camera.
-Yeah.It's a clean break right across the fibula.-My camera.
-Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.Get that fire out, otherwise there'll be an
acid cloud all over the Eastern seaboard.FIREMAN 1 : The pump house is gone!
FIREMAN 2: What?FIREMAN 1 : The pump house!
-We've lost the water pressure!-We've got to have water!
-How?Lake Comooga's five miles from here.
We'd need a five-mile hose!-Where's this lake?
-That way.Tell them it's hopeless.You told me we had
an adequate water supply.Water!I tell you, that man's a miracle![ROCK MUSlC PLAYS lN SCHOOL][PEOPLE CHATTER lNDlSTlNCTLY]WOMAN:

offers l didn't get.Even Brad wouldn't stick around.It really isn't easy.The streamers?
Yeah, you just pull, and--No, not the streamers. Everything.Not that l'm complaining.
It's just that......l don't know why,
I just feel like I can talk to you.What?I feel like I can talk to you!-You can?

-Queen of the prom.Then three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.-lsn't that terrible?
-Yeah, sure is.There must be a gallon
of potato salad left over.You know what the problem is?I don't know, too much mayonnaise?Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?No, the problem is,
why do l stay in Smallville?Believe me, l've asked myself that.Do you know how lucky you are
to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.Well, Lana, you could--Easy to say. But how?
What about Ricky?-Ricky?
-My little boy.-You? Oh, that's great.
-Yeah.I mean, at least here we have a house
and l've got a job that pays the bills.Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.That's a shame.[CLARK WHISTLES]You never got married?-Me?

Stolen from the firm.VERA:

By whom? Whom?WEBSTER:
Vera, get ahold of yourself.Nobody else ever will.SlMPSON:
I don't know.Whom?In the old days it was simple.We kept books, we knew what was

"Stick them up."Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.My old friend, you are yesterday.Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.Mr. Webster,

until he shakes the money tree again?-He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
-Why?That's what they always say
in the movies.He won't slip up at all. No, not at all.He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.He'll keep a low profile and won't
do a thing to call attention to himself.Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.[TlRES SCREECH]BOY 1 :

the only kid in town without a father.Oh, look. He's stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.-Gee, all he had was chocolate milk.
-No, him.Hey, sweet thing.Little kid getting hassled, huh?-Kent, you still here?
-l seem to be, Brad.All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.I won the all-country bowling
trophy two years in a row.I didn't know that.Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.Brad, you're just gonna
make it worse.-lt's all right. It'll be okay.
-He'll make it worse.[BOYS GRUMBLE]You watch, he'll get a spare.Come on, Ricky.Hey, kid, you're holding it all wrong.-Let old Brad show you how it's done.
-Brad.Excuse me. Say, Brad, l think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.For a guy lucky to be waterboy,
you've got a big mouth.I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.-He needs a man to show him.
-He's doing just fine. Excuse me.Here you go, Ricky.And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.Sorry.Ah-choo![BOYS SHOUT]Gesundheit.Thank you.Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.No, not that boss. The boss.-You mean, the boss...

why would he wanna see me?I mean....Why would the boss wanna see me?There's no reason.Then why'd he--? Oh, I know!It's my suggestion
for the volleyball uniforms.That's it.Ross the boss.
Ross the boss. The boss!Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?Mr. Webster, I did not-- Mr. Webster.WEBSTER:
Mr. August Gorman?GUS:
August Gorman here.I know you're a man of compassion,
and l don't wanna go to jail......because they have robbers
and rapists--I just wanna ask you one question.You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you?Come on, admit it now.You've been just a little bit naughty,
haven't you?-l was kind of--
-That's all right. I understand.I can-- What do
the young folks say today?"Dig where you're
coming from, brother."-You wanna be rich, right?
-How, wha--I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.GUS:
What do you do with your socks?I don't know. They're laundered and sent
to some charitable institution, l think.Actually, I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into dust rags......or pen-wipers or something.Or maybe socks.Yes! That never occurred to me.Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect, right? Cheers.Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.No, no, because computers
rule the world today.The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines......do what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?GUS: Yes!
-Gus......Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow me?GUS:
I follow you, sir.-Gus, do you know what l want now?
-No.I want coffee.All right. Black, cream, sugar, or--?No, you don't seem to understand.Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans......in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.But l've got a problem and l think
maybe you can help me.One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy, right?That could bug-- What country?-Colombia.
-Colombia?Colombia has two important exports,
and one of them's coffee.And l've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, l've tried.But this one miserable,
pissant little country......has the gall to think it can dictate
the economy of an open market. Gus.Gus, my friend......we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we?Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop......right down to the last bean.-The last bean, we are.
-Right.But you got so much. You know, like--A wise man once said,
I think it was Attila the Hun:"It is not enough that l succeed.Everyone else must fail."Seems fair.-Gus.
-What?You are going to do this for me.-How?
-The weather.You didn't say your mother was here.I'm his sister. His baby sister.Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?Hi, Ms. Vulcan.Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up......to monitor the weather.But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.It could make weather.WEBSTER:
Storms and floods.VERA:
Blizzards, heat waves.How do you do that?Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.You push buttons.[SHUTTER CLlCKS]-There you go.
-lt's the first time I won anything.You won my hand, Maury.But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.Let's get one with the sombreros.Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.-Why do l have to do this?
-Why do l have to do this?You're lucky l didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos......of history's biggest factory fire.He comes home with a broken leg
and 1 2 melted rolls of film.It was hot.Smile, Mr. White.South America!
I can't believe my luck!See, if you don't want them
to trace it back......you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit......that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer--Someplace you can sneak into, right?Somebody could--Someplace where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.Webscoe has 1 12 subsidiaries.They're all linked into
the central computer system.How about someplace......small?DRIVER: Smallville. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.Mind your step.Watch your step, please.Thanks, Selma.Thanks a lot, Lana.

-Stay close by and be careful, okay?Okay, Mom.RICKY: Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.-This is so nice for him.
-Here you go.It's even nicer when there's a man around,
which isn't that often.-There's a lot of choices.
-The good ones are married.That's why Brad thinks
he's God's gift to women.He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.This is really quite some picnic.
There's......some of that.Green stuff.Hey, pÃ¢tÃ©.Boy, this pÃ¢tÃ© is really unusual.I didn't make any-- Oh, Clark.That's Buster's dog food.-lt's good.
-Don't eat it!What time's the dog eat?-This is nice.
-Here.It's all right, Lana.Thanks.[BUSTER BARKS]Hey, where you going? Come on!Buster, stop messing about!-How much longer--?
-l was just thinking---l'm sorry. No, go ahead.
-No. You.Well......l was just thinking that......somebody like you
could do really well in Metropolis.I suppose I have to face it. l'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.Could l make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when l got there?Call me.-No, I wouldn't wanna call you.
-You don't wanna call me?Yes, l wanna call you, but l wouldn't
wanna be a nuisance to you.I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me, Lana.Clark, may l tell you something?My oil pan is leaking.See? There's something dripping.-Can l give you a hand?
-No, thanks.With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.Look at this.CLARK:
Oh, boy.[CLARK HEARS BUSTER WHIMPERING]Lana, l think l'll just go see

but have a doctor check him.Thank you.-l'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
-Nice to meet you.And this is Clark.I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.We were flying, Mom!What were you doing, anyway?I was looking for Buster.-Buster! Buster!
CLARK: l found him!CLARK:
Come on, boy. That's it.Mr. Kent, Superman was here!-What?
-Yes, he really was.Aren't you excited?I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.You do? Could you get me
his autograph?I don't know. lf I had a nickel
for every time some little kid....[RlNGS BUZZER]Yeah? What do you want?We're in big trouble, aren't we?-What?
-We're in big trouble.First, they lost the invoice.When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.So l rented a car because l missed the
plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.And l figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what l mean?What do you mean?He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.He wanted this special order installed......in his office no later
than tomorrow morning.Let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.Get all what set up?Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.-Which way's the office?

of Colombia this afternoon......threatening to destroy the nation's
entire coffee crop for the next five years.Gale-force winds up to......an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside......while 1 2 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said this was, I quote:"The most awesome display of
natural forces since Noah's ark."If l laugh any harder, l'll split my sides!--to defy all laws of
weather systems known to science.What a shame.Poor little Colombia. Well....[WEBSTER CHUCKLES][SCREAMS]I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly!Bubba, do you realize what we're on to?WEBSTER:

-lf Gus can push the right buttons--I can have it all. Holy cats!All the oil.All the pumps.All the tankers.This is some nifty idea, Vera.GUS: Boss?
WEBSTER: Very nifty.-Just the man l want to see.
-Boss, it is not my fault.Isn't it neat? There---What's not your fault?
-Superman.How was l to know he was
gonna start doing his thing......when you started doing your thing?VERA: What are you talking about?
-What am l talk--?It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?Don't call me "man."I just saw Colombia
bite the dust. That's all.You didn't see the man come flying out
of the sky from the clouds? It was him!With his cape flapping in the--His cape was flapping in the wind!He was flying! He was great!He was just flying around....His cape was blowing in the wind
like this. It looked like a flag!And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation!And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.Straight-out laser points.Dried up everything!Just like that!I'm talking about drying it up,
like machines in the men's rooms.You know what l mean?Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.Sometimes they don't work, right?But Superman's worked!You think he stood around
to take bows? Not this man.No, sir. He flies off again. Right?Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.He flew into the tornado......went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down!He made the little end on top
and the big end on the bottom!I was gonna go crazy!I've never seen nothing like it.The big end was on the bottom.Little end on the top.Mr. Ross, it was-- The big....Superman's bad.I'll say he was.I mean, he was bad!No.No!Here, let me help.-lt was a perfect plan. lt was foolproof!
-And we were the fools.It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.-l've got to get rid of him.
-How?Shoot him? You know
about him and bullets.-Kryptonite.
-What?Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.-How would you know about that?
-l know a few things.I know, from the graffiti l saw.WEBSTER:
Wait a second.She's right.Kryptonite. I remember reading
about it in an interview with him.VERA:
Where does it come from?WEBSTER: The same planet Superman
came from: Krypton.VERA:
Where is Krypton?GUS:
It's nowhere.It blew up in space, years ago.They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.I know some things too.Wait a minute. You know
what happens when a planet explodes.-Debris. Things floating in space.
VERA: So?So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.Then we get good old Gus
to contact the Vulcan satellite.Old Gus has been doing some thinking.Good. That's why I keep you around.Yeah. l've been thinking that l'm not
making enough money for this gig.Gus, if there's anything I hate......it's greed.Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.Let me tell you something.I can't ski![YELLS]WEBSTER: Once Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite......he orders it to search
through space......around where Krypton
went bye-bye.Then the laser probe locks
on to a floating chunk of Kryptonite.The computer analyzes
the components......and the boys at the lab
duplicate the stuff down here.GUS:

He got carried away......and told the kids Superman
was coming on his birthday.Okay, it was wrong......but when Wednesday comes and
Superman doesn't show, it's gonna....Well, Lana, in this case I think
I can go ahead and speak for Superman.I mean, he and l
are pretty close, you know.And you can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right?Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had......in a long time.-Tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
-All right.-But, Clark...
-Yeah?...you're the best.And l'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.In a church?SClENTlST:

I'm from Earth.[MARCHlNG BAND PLAYS]SUPERMAN:
Lana, l really wasn't expecting all this.I guess they did get
a little carried away.Superman, we all know......that you're not looking
for honors and awards.But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky......we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.First, for putting out
the Lake Comooga fire.And not least,
for saving little Ricky.So since you already have
the key to our hearts......Superman......may l present you
with the key to the city.Thank you, sir.Thank you.[HONKS HORN]As you were.Now listen up.I just came in directly......from the Pentagon......and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that l did.Because God has given us......one of the greatest gifts in the world:Chemicals.Now, you people, you like to go sit

the Super Bowl.CROWD:
Yeah.Sit on what?!You sit on molded, plastic seats!Molded to your well-fed behinds.Now, l don't have to tell you

sitting down......to write a peace treaty......and have his ballpoint pen bust open......and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants......in front of the world leaders?CROWD:
No. No.Now, we all know......that last week, half of
this great nation of ours......almost bit the bullet......if it wasn't for this man here.[CHEERlNG]And all l can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.Superman, you saved our bacon......and l'd like to show our gratitude.This is a small token
of our appreciation......to show to you for saving us
from a chemical-plant disaster.Thank you very much, general.This is very nice. Thank you.[CROWD CHEERS][MARCHlNG BAND PLAYS]It's very nice.Unknown. How am l supposed
to know what "unknown" means?It means unknown. lt means
nobody knows what it means.-Hello, boss?
WEBSTER: Gus?-Gus Gorman here.
-I know that. How did it go?You know how they're always
trying to find the secret recipe......in that chicken in the bucket?And nobody seems to know
the ingredient......because it's unknown, right?In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.He didn't die.I ask you to kill Superman......and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.Hello?[BUSTER WHlMPERlNG][BUSTER BARKlNG]He hasn't had
an afternoon nap for years.This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.You did with that wonderful lunch.Oh, well, l do like to cook.-You'll take some coffee?
-Yes, please.-Decaffeinated, of course.
-Right.[PHONE RlNGS]Hello? Yes.What?Oh, really?Yeah, he's here.I'll tell him.
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.Superman, that was my friend Betty.There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.Well, there's no rush.-But the bridge--
-lt's okay. l always get there on time.Come on, let's relax a little.It's unusual finding a good-looking girl

do something about the bridge?What bridge?You're right.I have to get going.[SIREN WAILS]OFFlCER:

What about synthetic unity?Hi, honey! Am I in your way?-Stick around, you may learn something.
-Hi, Lorelei.All the oil tankers in the world
are totally controlled by computers.They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up......and where to deliver it.Don't they have captains
on these ships?Yes, but they don't need them.That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.VERA: You will command the tankers
to sail toward a 50-mile area......in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.And do what?And do nothing.Just sit there.How are all the people
gonna get their oil?You catch on fast, old buddy.Every oil pump in America is run by---Computers. l know.
-Will you stop interrupting?!I'm sorry.You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.WEBSTER: Then l want you to program
one special command......into all these systems.Tell them these orders
are irreversible.So it would be impossible

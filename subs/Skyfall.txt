so l gave him up.l got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.We should go, ma'am.
Board of lnquiry
begins in 30 minutes.l want to know
what's on that computer.Now, looking at
Silva's computer,it seems to me he's done
a number of
slightly unusual things.He's established
failsafe protocols
to wipe the memoryif there's any
attempt to access
certain files.Only six people in the world
could program
safeguards like that.Of course there are.
Can you get past them?l invented them.Right, then.Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.We're in.(EXHALES)Sir, what do you make of this?lt's his Omega site.Most encrypted level he has.Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.Security through obscurity.Ladies and gentlemen,
if l might have order?l'd like to begin
the proceedings.We're gathered today
to address important issuesconcerning the future
of our national security.(GROANS LOUDLY)Going somewhere?So you believe your
stewardship of Ml6
during the recent crisishas been up to scratch?Well,
l believe we have apprehended
the responsible partyand are taking
all necessary stepsto ensure that
the sensitive information
is contained.Oh,so it's a job well done.l'm not saying
it's gone perfectly, but. . .You'll forgive me
for not putting
up the bunting.l find it rather difficult
to overlook monumentalsecurity breaches
and dead operativesfor which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.He's using
a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.Whenever l try to
gain access, it changes.lt's like
solving a Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.Stop.Go in on that.Granborough.Granborough Road.
lt's an old Tube station
on the Metropolitan Line.Been closed for years.Use that as a key.Oh, look, it's a map!lt's London.Subterranean London.What's going on?
Why are the doors open?(COMPUTER BEEPlNG)Oh, no.Can someone tell me
how the hell he
got into our system?Oh, shit.Oh, shit, shit, shit.He hacked us.(ALARM BLARlNG)Oh, no.Q.He's gone.l'm in a stairwell
below isolation.Do you read me, Q?l can hear you.
l'm looking for you.Got you.
Tracking your location.Just keep moving forward.Enter the next
service door on your right.lf you're through that door,
you should be in the Tube.l'm in the Tube.Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years
in the planning.He wanted us to
capture him, he wanted us
to access his computer.lt was all planned.Blowing up HQ.
Knowing the emergency
protocols.Knowing we'd
retreat down here.l've got all that.
lt's what he's got
planned next that worries me.District Line is the closest.
There's a service
door on your left.Got it.lt won't open.lt will.
Put your back into it.Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?(GRUNTlNG)No, it's stuck.Oh, good.
There's a train coming.Hmm. That's vexing.l'm through.Told you.We alerted security.
Police are on their way.Where are you now?Temple Tube station.Along with half of London.Oh, l see you. There you are.l know where l am, Q.
Where's he?Give us a second.
l'm looking for him.ANNOUNCER: Mind the gap.BOND: There's too many people.
l can't see him.Welcome to rush
hour on the Tube.Not something
you'd know much about.Mind the gap.The train's leaving.
Do l get on the train?Don't get on.
l'm not sure he's on it.
Give us a minute.Do l get on the train?Bond.What?
Get on the train.He's keen to get home.Will you open the door,
please?Open the door.Health and Safety.
Carry on.Q: Where are you?Take a wild guess, Q.He's in disguise,
dressed as a policeman.Of course he is.Where's he going?
Where's he going?He's going for M.
Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.You've overlooked,
or chosen to ignore,
hard evidenceand consistently,
almost obstinately. . .Silva's escaped.
Bond's in pursuit.We need to get you
to a secure
location immediately.l'll be damned
if l'm gonna show her my back.Are we straining
your attention?No. Please, Minister, proceed.Excuse me.Move! Move!(PEOPLE SHOUTlNG)(CHUCKLES)(LAUGHlNG)lt's as if you
insist on pretendingwe still live in
a golden age of espionagewhere human intelligence was
the only resource available.Well, l find this
rather old-fashioned beliefdemonstrates
a reckless disregard for. . .Excuse me, Minister,
l don't mean to interrupt,but just for
the sake of variety,might we actually
hear from the witness?Of course.Thank you.Oh !l won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.Not bad. Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.Oi. Thank you.You caught me.(SlGHS)Now, here's your prize.The latest thing
from my local toy store.lt's called radio.Whew!l do hope that wasn't for me.(LAUGHS)
No.But that is.(TRAlN APPROACHlNG)(SlRENS WAlLlNG)M: Chairman, Ministers.Today l've
repeatedly heard howirrelevant my
department has become.Why do we need agents?
The Double-O section?lsn't it all rather quaint?Well, l suppose l
see a different world
than you do.And the truth is that
what l see frightens me.l'm frightened
because our enemies
are no longer known to us.They do not exist on a map.They're not nations.
They are individuals.Look around you.
Who do you fear?Can you see a face?
A uniform? A flag? No.Our world is not
more transparent now.lt's more opaque.lt's in the shadows.That's where we
must do battle.So, before you
declare us irrelevant,
ask yourselves,how safe do you feel?l've just one
more thing to say.My late husband
was a great lover
of poetry.And, um. . .l suppose some of it sunk in,
despite my best intentions.And here today
l remember this,
l think from Tennyson:"We are not now
that strength,"which in old days
Moved earth and heaven;"That which we are, we are;"One equal temper
of heroic hearts,"Made weak by time"and fate,"but strong in will"To strive, to seek,"to find"and not to yield."(PEOPLE SCREAMlNG)Go, go, go, go!Move!Move! Go! Move!(SlRENS WAlLlNG lN DlSTANCE)007,
what the hell are we doing?
Are you kidnapping me?That would be one
way of looking at it.Too many people are
dying because of me.lf he wants you,
he'll have to
come and get you.We've been one
step behind Silva
from the start.lt's time to get out in front,
change the game.And l'm to be the bait?All right.
But just us.
No one else.Q? l need help.l'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?l've got M.
We're about to disappear.What?l need you to lay
a trail of breadcrumbs
impossible to followfor anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it?l'm guessing this
isn't strictly official.Not even remotely.So much for my
promising career
in espionage.l'm not hiding in there,
if that's your brilliant plan.We're changing vehicles.Trouble with company cars is
they have trackers.Oh, and l suppose
that's
completely inconspicuous.Get in.(TlRES SCREECHlNG)lt's not very comfortable,
is it?Are you gonna
complain the whole way?Oh, go on then, eject me.
See if l care.Where are we going?Back in time.Somewhere we'll
have the advantage.lt's a fine line.Make the breadcrumb too small
and he might miss it.Too big and Silva
will smell a rat.But do you think even Silva
will be able to spot that?He's the only one who could.Sir.Oh.What are you doing?We're just. . .monitoring.Creating a false
tracking signal
for Silva to follow.Well, sir, um. . .
Well, no.Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.Send him on the A9.
lt's the direct route.You can monitor his progress
more accuratelyand confirm it with
the traffic cameras.But what if the PM finds out?Then we're all buggered.Carry on.(BlRDS CHlRPlNG)(SlGHS)ls this where you grew up?Mm.How old were you
when they died?You know the answer to that.You know the whole story.(SlGHS)Orphans always make
the best recruits.Storm's coming.Christ.Mm-hmm.No wonder you never came back.(FLOORBOARD CREAKS)James.James Bond.BOND: Good God.Are you still alive?lt's nice to see you, too.M, this is Kincade.Gamekeeper here
since l was a boy.Pleased to meet you, Emma.Mr. Kincade.You're a tad late.
They've sold the place,when they
thought you were dead.lt seems they were wrong.What are you doing here?Some men are
coming to kill us.But we're gonna
kill them first.Then we'd better get ready.Do we still have a gun room?Ah.They sold
the lot to a collector
from ldaho or some such place.They were
shipped out weeks ago.There's just. . .your father's
old hunting rifle.We couldn't let that go.And this is what we've got.There might be
a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.But if all else fails,sometimes the old
ways are the best.So who is it we're
supposed to be fighting?No "we" in it, Kincade.This is not your fight.Try and stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.(COCKS GUN)Now,
remember what l taught you.
Don't let it pull to the left.l'll do my best.What did you say
you did for a living?Emma!l brought you some things.The nights get cold here.Thank you, Mr. Kincade.lt's a beautiful old house.She is.And like all great ladies,
she still has her secret ways.Let me show you this.Priest's hole?Yeah, from Reformation times.The tunnel leads
under the moor.lf you get in danger,
this is the place to come.The night l told him
his parents had died,
he hid in here for two days.When he did come out. . .he wasn't a boy anymore.Eh. Must get on.l fucked this up, didn't l?No.You did your job.l read your obituary of me.And?Appalling.Yeah, l knew you'd hate it.l did call you "an exemplar
of British fortitude".That bit was all right.(DOGS BARKlNG lN DlSTANCE)You ready?l was ready before
you were born, son.(DOGS CONTlNUE BARKlNG)(BEEPlNG RAPlDLY)(BULLETS RlCOCHETlNG)Welcome to Scotland.(PANTlNG)(RlFLE BLASTlNG)(BURST OF GUNFlRE)You dropped something.You hurt?Only my pride.
l never was a good shot.He's not here.(HELlCOPTER APPROACHlNG)(ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG LOUDLY)(MUSlC CONTlNUES LOUDLY)Always got to
make an entrance.You two, go to the kitchen.
Now.Get behind the arch !Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.Everyone, listen to me!
Don't you dare touch her.
She's mine.Can your friend
come out and say hello?(FLAMES CRACKLlNG)(GROANS)Come on. This way.l always hated this place.Are you getting warm?Just make sure Bond's dead !Now it's me and her.(COUGHlNG)(GRUNTS)(GROANS)(lCE CRACKLlNG)(GUNFlRE)You see what comes
of all this
running around, Mr. Bond?All this jumping and fighting.lt's exhausting !Relax.(EXHALES)You need to relax.Ah, well. . .
Mother's calling.l'll give her
a goodbye kiss for you.Oh, my God.(SlGHS)(CHUCKLES)(SlGHS)Of course.lt had to be here.lt had to be this way.Thank you.l can't find it no. . .
Don't.Please. Don't.You're hurt. You're hurt.What have they done to you?(GRUNTlNG)(M WHlMPERS)(PANTlNG)Free both of us.Free both of us. . .with the same bullet.Do it.Only you can do it.Do it.(THUD)
(GROANlNG)(GROANS)(WHEEZES)Ah !(PAlNED EXHALE)Last rat standing.007. What took you so long?Well, l got into
some deep water.(M GROANlNG)Oh !l suppose it's. . .too late to make a run for it?Well, l'm game if you are.l did get one thing right.Wow.l didn't even know
you could come up here.Hate to waste a view.l can see why.l thought you
were going back out
on active service.l declined.You said it yourself,fieldwork's not for everyone.lf it helps,
l feel a lot safer.Her will was read today.She left you this.Maybe it was her
way of telling you
to take a desk job.Just the opposite.Thank you.(DlSTANT SlREN WAlLlNG)You know, we've never formally
been introduced.Well, my name's Eve.Eve Moneypenny.Well, l look forward
to our time together,
Miss Moneypenny.Me, too. l'm sure we'll have
one or two close shaves.Morning, 007.Good morning, Tanner.He'll see you now.How's the arm, sir?What? Oh, it's fine.lt'll get better.All pretty shocking
for someone
unused to fieldwork.So, 007. . .
Lots to be done.Are you ready to
get back to work?With pleasure, M.With pleasure.

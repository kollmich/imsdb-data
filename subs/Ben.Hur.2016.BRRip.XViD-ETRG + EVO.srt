1
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,070
In the time of the Messiah,

2
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,992
the Roman Empire grows
to span thousands of miles.

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,673
It is an empire nourished by blood

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,916
and secured by fear.

5
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,112
They will take everything you have.

6
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,636
They will invite you
to their games to watch others suffer

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,119
and forget what you have lost.

8
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,796
They will leave you with
nothing but bitterness...

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,030
...and desire for revenge.

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,231
You should have stayed away.

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,716
You should have killed me.

12
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,032
I will.

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,709
Don't burn out
your horse too soon.

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,711
Three laps to go!

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,438
Try keeping up, Judah!

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,873
Don't embarrass yourself!

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,228
Watch your back, brother!

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,276
You're a prince, not a warrior!

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,193
Prince Judah Ben-Hur, a Jew.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,549
Messala Severus,
his adopted brother, a Roman.

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,671
They were as devoted to each
other as they were competitive.

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,075
You're a cheat!

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,798
Cheat? All is fair to you Romans!

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,029
Oh, that's low!

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,872
Judah's father passed away

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,116
holding onto the hope
that the two brothers

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,676
could be an example of unity
in this divided land.

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Cheat!

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,720
One more lap to go!

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,595
Judah.

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,239
Judah!

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Judah!

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,273
Help!

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,274
Mother?

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,669
Judah's hurt! Someone help!

36
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Mama!

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,638
Nanny. Nanny, help.
Take him. Take him.

38
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,669
- Careful, careful.
- What happened? Judah?

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,354
Judah!

40
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,640
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Is he all right?

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,336
- What happened?
- There was a rock.

42
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,952
Mother?

43
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,712
Quick, fetch a doctor for your brother.

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,796
Tirzah! Run!

45
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
- Esther?
- Yes, Father?

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,952
Prepare the room for Master Judah.

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,720
- Get water.
- Hurry, Esther.

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,993
Careful, careful.

49
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,873
Get some water.

50
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Up.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,428
He's badly hurt. What have you done?

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,397
I haven't done anything.
It was an accident.

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,198
Judah was thrown from his horse.

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,874
- We were riding and...
- Racing!

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Mum...

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,633
What should I do?

57
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,553
You've done enough. Now pray.

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,279
My son, will he live?

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,976
- Minerva...
- He will recover.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,736
- The doctor reassured us.
- ...Mother Goddess,

61
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,954
restore him by the skin.

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,016
But, Mother, he looks
like he's in so much pain.

63
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,996
Thank your Messala for that.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,831
Be strong, Master Judah.

65
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,829
Wait. Wait.

66
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,513
You are like an angel.

67
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,434
Tirzah.

68
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,119
Go to bed.

69
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,873
Good night.

70
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,589
We have different gods, Messala.

71
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,633
Did we have fun?

72
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,515
- Esther, dance with me.
- I'm not allowed.

73
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,995
Well, we can give people
something to talk about.

74
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,832
We can cause a scandal. Come on.

75
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,875
Oh, let me help you.

76
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,632
I have it. It's not your place.

77
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,150
You know there's a whole
world beyond Jerusalem.

78
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,152
Greece, Persia, Egypt.

79
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,400
I just want to experience it.

80
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,118
I'm tired of reading about it,

81
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,236
hearing about it from travelers.

82
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,436
- Are you?
- Yes.

83
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,114
- But you make it sound so easy.
- It's not easy.

84
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,634
But that's life.

85
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,835
Tirzah.

86
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,638
Could you help me
to my bedroom, please?

87
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,198
You spend
too much idle time with Messala.

88
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,837
If I didn't,
you'd have nothing to complain about.

89
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,513
"Oh, have mercy on me, world!

90
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,195
"Not one of my 359 gods
will smile upon me."

91
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,350
Don't mock.

92
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,318
What's wrong with you?
It's supposed to be a celebration.

93
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,516
It's a celebration of your faith, not mine.

94
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,239
Well, that's the virtue of wine.
It doesn't discriminate.

95
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,016
So what happened with you and Tirzah?

96
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,031
Your mother doesn't want us speaking.

97
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,553
And who cares what Mother wants?

98
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,358
Your mother cares.

99
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,509
And?

100
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,792
- Listen, Judah, I...
- You have feelings for Tirzah.

101
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,199
Messala, admit it.

102
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,918
What am I supposed to do with them?

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,513
You and your family are royalty.

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,556
And what does that matter?

105
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,056
I'd rather she was paying attention to you

106
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,559
than some other brute.

107
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,675
Thanks.

108
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,656
I'm not saying you're a brute,
I'm saying you're brutish.

109
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,749
Oh...

110
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,593
Simonides, go to bed. Messala!

111
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,515
- You and Tirzah would be like...
- Like what?

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,309
Like we were family.
We're not family, are we?

113
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,874
Are we?

114
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,633
I'm just a lowly orphan
your family took in.

115
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,631
Oh, my God. Of course we're family!

116
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,995
You're my brother.
You'll always be my brother.

117
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,911
Everything I own is yours.

118
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,832
No. I'll never have your name.

119
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,296
And every time my name is spoken,

120
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,039
it will be spoken alongside
stories of my grandfather.

121
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,439
Until I earn it back.

122
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,438
Messala, wait. Wait!

123
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,079
Messala.

124
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,840
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Rome.

125
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
Wait. What do you mean,
you're going to Rome?

126
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,435
Messala, stop.

127
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,796
The Emperor's called for men to put
down the rebellion in Germania.

128
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,869
He's called for idiots to fight and die.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,069
I can't believe this.

130
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,456
After everything we've done for you,

131
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
you still want to go and fight
for those murderers!

132
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,993
The pay's steady.

133
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,308
"The pay's steady"?

134
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,550
So I can come back to Tirzah
with stature and wealth.

135
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,993
But wealth doesn't mean anything.

136
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,040
- It never does if you're rich.
- Messala, please.

137
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,189
Look, tell Tirzah...

138
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,976
If you have something
to say to her, say it yourself.

139
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,036
Otherwise you're just walking away.

140
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,069
Judah?

141
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,033
Where's Messala?

142
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,473
Messala,

143
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,199
I hope this letter finds
you well, if at all.

144
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,679
As with all the others
I've sent over the past three years,

145
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,836
I expect no response.

146
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,992
I can only hope that it is by your choice
and not by the way of your demise.

147
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,310
I always prefer
not to see my food before I eat it.

148
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,674
That's probably the best idea.

149
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,751
You would hardly recognize
your Jerusalem now.

150
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,056
What? What are you looking at?

151
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,149
The circus.

152
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,736
The Romans continue
to leave their mark

153
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,637
and build their circus.

154
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,473
When you come home,
I will honor the monstrosity

155
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,358
by humiliating you in one of those
chariots you Romans so love.

156
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Yes, of course.

157
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,994
But, brother, I do have news to tell you.

158
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,115
Here, try it.

159
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,349
Two months ago,

160
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,352
Esther's father found
a wealthy Roman for her to marry.

161
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,317
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

162
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,120
We still have to find you
something special.

163
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,776
Oh, no, that's okay. I don't want anything.

164
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,473
I gave my blessing knowing
in my heart it was a mistake.

165
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,040
I was reminded of how
I used to jest to Mother

166
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
that one day we would wed...

167
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,793
Go with God.

168
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,351
...knowing the thought
of her son, a prince,

169
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,233
marrying a servant
would send her to an early grave.

170
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,319
I couldn't let her go.

171
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,471
If you leave me,
you leave me with nothing.

172
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,470
She is now my wife, brother.

173
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,877
Despite the wonderful life
we have together,

174
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,315
Rome has come to lay
a hard hand on the city.

175
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,119
Repeated attacks have left
them with little patience.

176
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,236
Thankfully,
we've been able to retain their favor.

177
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,673
Well, for now.

178
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,239
Hear my plea.

179
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,233
Be safe. Return home.

180
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,550
I will listen to stories of your travels.

181
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,675
Judah.

182
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,000
- What have you found?
- I don't know what it is.

183
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,270
I know what this is!
This is a Senet board.

184
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,760
- How much for this?
- Five shekels.

185
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,594
A Zealot,
and that he will be subject today

186
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,071
to the customary punishment
of crucifixion.

187
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,276
- No!
- May his punishment

188
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,397
stand as a warning.

189
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,111
- Ah, the Zealots.
- All they want is freedom.

190
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,474
And at what cost?

191
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,629
If they had their way,

192
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,816
they'll bring the whole
of Rome down on us.

193
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,856
Then where will our freedom be?

194
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,536
- How much is it? Five?
- Thank you, My Lord.

195
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,551
There's freedom elsewhere.

196
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,869
Excuse me?

197
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,759
Love your enemies.

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,231
"Love your enemies."
Well, that's very progressive.

199
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,233
It's the truth.

200
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,556
God is love.
He made us to share that love.

201
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,536
And where will your love be
when the Romans

202
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,232
turn their anger on the rest of us?

203
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,271
Hate and fear are lies.

204
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,040
They turn us against each other.

205
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,993
Those are the lies that make us slaves.

206
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,230
He has a path planned for you.

207
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,719
If He has a path planned for me,

208
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,392
how am I better off than a slave?

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,918
Why don't you ask her?

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,228
Esther.

211
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,717
There's truth to what he's saying.

212
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,199
There must be something better.

213
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,672
Better than what?

214
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,155
Look around you.

215
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,376
The roads are lined
with the sick and poor.

216
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,736
We should be grateful
we're not one of them.

217
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,936
- Can you spare something, please?
- We can be more than grateful.

218
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,475
Esther, I'm not denying
the fact that the world is a cruel place.

219
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,376
But it's our responsibility
to take care of ourselves

220
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,719
and the ones we love.

221
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,473
If people took care
of themselves, we'd all be saved.

222
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,433
If God is righteous,
then we should do righteous things.

223
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,353
If there is a God, then why
doesn't He do right by the world?

224
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,912
Come. Follow me.

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,878
Follow me.
Follow me. This way.

226
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,551
Let's go. Stay with me.

227
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,073
Who's there?

228
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,599
Jacob, stop. He's my brother.

229
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,398
Put the knife down.

230
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,873
Put it down.

231
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,198
Judah.

232
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,315
- What happened to him?
- He's wounded.

233
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,960
- Yes, I can see that. How?
- The cemetery.

234
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,992
Romans take the stones of our ancestors

235
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,308
to build their circus.

236
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,470
Not anymore.

237
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,120
- You're Zealots!
- We fight for your freedom.

238
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,080
From what I can see,
you get young boys injured.

239
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
We need a doctor.

240
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,836
No, a doctor would
inform the centurions.

241
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,672
Go and get a candle. Go.

242
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,039
I need your knife.

243
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,039
What's your name?

244
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,036
- Dismas.
- Dismas.

245
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,428
I hope you're proud of yourselves.

246
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,638
You know our aim.

247
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,030
Independence from Caesar,
ending the occupation of the Holy Land.

248
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,350
- By killing Romans?
- We settle scores.

249
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,431
Not here. Not in Jerusalem.

250
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,479
Dismas, it's a little bit
of pain and then it's done.

251
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,119
Let me see.

252
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,079
You're a part of this?

253
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,192
The man you love is a Roman!

254
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,508
We don't kill all Romans.

255
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,670
Well, that's not very
comforting to the dead ones.

256
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,397
If your father was alive,
he would support us.

257
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,516
You, I don't know,
so you can shut your mouth.

258
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,194
This is your home,
this is your land, too.

259
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,838
They turn our brothers into slaves

260
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,512
and that doesn't move you?

261
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,192
Killing doesn't get us up from under.

262
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,714
- Being passive has done what?
- It keeps the peace.

263
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,199
You confuse peace with freedom.

264
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,594
Jacob.

265
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,070
The High Priests,
you in the privileged class...

266
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,993
You get Caesar's favor
in exchange for obedience.

267
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,192
The rest of us get scraps.

268
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,513
I won't condone violence.

269
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,999
Nobody's asking your permission.

270
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,792
You keep my family
and my house clean of this.

271
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,599
Now get out.

272
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,240
- The boy?
- He's safe here.

273
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,639
Safer than with you.

274
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,832
I said get out!

275
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,556
You know, Mother has
hopes for a grandchild.

276
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,631
She asks me every day. I tell her, "Soon."

277
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,998
But I know "soon"
isn't soon enough for her.

278
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,119
That sounds wonderful.

279
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Judah Ben-Hur?

280
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,193
- Yes?
- Follow us.

281
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,536
Where are you taking him?

282
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,080
Don't worry, we've done nothing wrong.

283
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,917
It's all right, go inside.

284
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,713
I've brought the Jew.

285
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,910
I haven't changed that much, have I?

286
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,752
You look like one of those statues

287
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,990
you Romans insist on
putting everywhere.

288
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,630
You look like the clay
they make them from.

289
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,757
Statues are made of marble, not clay.

290
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,353
Not the one they'd make of you.

291
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,353
Look at this.

292
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,789
Wow.

293
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,710
Well, come on, tell me.
Tell me everything.

294
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,308
Up Mars!

295
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,472
Move forward!

296
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,671
Move forward!

297
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,536
I'm not sure
you want to hear everything.

298
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,516
And you were right
about life as a soldier.

299
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,108
Sleepless nights in the mud.
Cold and wet.

300
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,592
Drusus, move forward!

301
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,069
- If we stay here, we'll die!
- Then you go!

302
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,748
One night in Persia...

303
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,909
Your name?

304
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,274
...I met him.

305
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,955
- Your name!
- Messala Severus.

306
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,596
Captain Messala Severus.
These are your men now.

307
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,590
- Start leading!
- Sir!

308
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,910
His name was Pontius Pilate.

309
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,592
He gave me a chance.

310
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,319
He reminded me of
what we were fighting for.

311
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,038
Things you and I believe in, Judah.

312
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,554
A civilized world, progress,
prosperity, stability.

313
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,271
I battled and marched through countries

314
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,477
and across continents
I'd once dreamed of.

315
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,870
I led my men from battle to battle,
to the heights of glory.

316
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,520
But we crushed the freedom
of innocent civilizations

317
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,790
simply because they were different.

318
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,631
I saw much blood spilled.

319
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,755
More than I can describe.

320
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,399
Attention!

321
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,994
My true fight became
with my commander,

322
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,399
Marcus.

323
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,158
Why haven't you attacked the city?

324
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,595
An attack wasn't needed.
My orders were to pacify the city.

325
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,477
Leaving no able-bodied man alive.

326
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,477
Well, who will till the field or harvest...

327
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,876
We need to stamp out
revolt in every corner of the Empire.

328
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,996
If you want to offer up
another lifeless husk

329
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,752
- to the Empire...
- Messala Severus?

330
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,919
We've heard the stories
about your grandfather.

331
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,271
His hand in betraying Julius Caesar.

332
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,590
And how he wailed
when he was crucified.

333
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,116
In spite of that,
I'm thankful Pilate's on my side, brother.

334
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,915
More thankful to see you.

335
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,188
Me, too.

336
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
To think you were just
a lowly Hur before you left.

337
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, Mother missed you every day.

338
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,636
Ah, I'm sorry I left you alone with her.

339
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,629
Tirzah?

340
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,473
How is she?

341
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,711
Tirzah's good, she's well.

342
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,960
Judah, will you tell her...

343
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,120
No, you can tell her yourself.
She's not yet married.

344
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,119
My God, you still have it.

345
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,639
Why didn't you write?

346
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,193
What would I say?

347
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,151
I don't know.
That you're alive? That you're well?

348
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,716
Anything would have sufficed.

349
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,153
Judah,

350
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,953
I had to be able to come back
on my own terms.

351
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,238
Your family gave me everything.

352
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,713
I wanted to be able to return the favor.

353
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,915
Now I can.

354
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,957
Mmm. Judah, listen.

355
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,520
- I need your help.
- Messala.

356
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,754
You're needed outside.
There's been another attack.

357
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,637
Stretcher bearer, over here.

358
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,436
What's being said about Pontius Pilate?

359
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,919
To be honest, nothing good.

360
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,016
In a few days, he wants
to ride through Jerusalem

361
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,473
at the head of a legion.

362
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,869
Why?

363
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,472
The Zealots.

364
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,518
I've tried to deal with them peacefully.
Peace doesn't work.

365
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,396
- So now you try a legion.
- That's not my choice.

366
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,751
All they want from Rome
is their land back.

367
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,318
It was never their land.
It belonged to you, the wealthy.

368
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,960
You don't really believe
in a return to the Age of Solomon.

369
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,216
When the Zealots
are done with us, they'll turn on you.

370
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,118
I don't care about their politics.
I just care about keeping the peace.

371
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,269
Then we're agreed!

372
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,635
Look, Zealots are the common enemy.

373
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,871
Listen, you're a prince.
You have the ear of your people.

374
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,994
Pontius Pilate has to
ride through Jerusalem with no trouble.

375
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,911
That's all I'm asking.

376
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,918
Brother, I've been away a long time.

377
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,190
If I come back now,
believe me, it's important.

378
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,919
I want to give you this.

379
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,631
I've done a lot of work with this.

380
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,473
It would give me nothing but joy

381
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,074
to know it was in your hands
and lay forever idle.

382
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,789
I'll speak to my people,
find out what I can.

383
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Thank you.

384
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,312
- But you must come to dinner.
- I will.

385
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,595
But nothing special. Just a simple meal.

386
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,711
I promise. A simple meal.

387
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,936
What's this about?

388
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,872
There's been an attack
at the cemetery. Zealots.

389
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,188
Breathing still?

390
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,430
This is Vilarius. I know him.

391
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,034
Pull him out. Brother...

392
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,680
Lost quite a bit of blood.

393
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,994
Messala.

394
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,192
What happened, Lucius?

395
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,993
Zealots.

396
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,475
They poured through
the encampment under cover of night.

397
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,231
We had no way of...

398
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,710
The people's gratitude
for your bloodless suppression.

399
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,199
What were your men doing here?

400
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,913
Orders were to gather stones
to build the circus.

401
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,672
You understand this is sacred land.

402
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,677
These are Judean graves.

403
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,111
I'm informing Pilate.

404
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,912
If you rule as occupiers,
you will be met with disaster, I promise.

405
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,958
Are you as treasonous
as you are useless?

406
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,958
That's my brother's bow.

407
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,679
You should be resting.

408
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,274
I'm fine.

409
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,791
I need to redress the wound.

410
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,189
Sit.

411
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,480
Well, if you want to
call anywhere home again,

412
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,879
you'll need to be more careful.

413
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,111
The people you run with now are trouble.

414
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,336
I see they've sold you
on the romance of fighting,

415
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,496
but the reality is very different.

416
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,999
How would you know?

417
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,198
I know when I found you,
you were almost dead.

418
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,352
And for what?

419
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,936
So you can say
you evened up with the Romans?

420
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,155
We're not trying to balance anything.

421
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,520
We want the freedom we were born with.

422
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,056
And if the Romans won't give it to us,
we'll have to take it by force.

423
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,911
How many Romans do you even know?

424
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,677
Have you ever had a conversation
with a single one in your life?

425
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,601
Don't spit your hate for all
when you don't even know one.

426
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,595
Now, you're welcome to stay
here as long as you need.

427
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,576
When you're well,
you should go back to your family.

428
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,919
I should.

429
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,671
But my father was able-bodied,
so the Romans killed him.

430
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,435
My mother was fertile,
so they did other things to her.

431
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,033
Everybody, just act normal.

432
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
He's coming.

433
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,911
Oh, for God's sake, more normal.

434
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,439
Welcome home.

435
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,276
This is Captain Drusus,
my second-in-command.

436
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,191
- Greetings.
- To you, Prince.

437
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,679
I owe this man my life.

438
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,280
We have something in common, at least.

439
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,200
I have a small gift from my travels.

440
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,113
The finest silk in all of Egypt.

441
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,957
It reminded me of you.

442
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,353
Your return is gift enough for me.

443
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,999
So

444
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,796
you never got married.

445
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,553
Don't they teach subtlety
in Caesar's army?

446
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,591
You must have a hundred men
fighting over you.

447
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,829
A few.

448
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,512
But you spoiled me for others.

449
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,670
- Oh, don't say that!
- It's true.

450
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,272
Well, you should be happy.
You deserve to be.

451
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,432
I know. I look like a monster.

452
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,998
Nothing like one.

453
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,393
You know this scar, of course.

454
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,080
- This one I got in Germania.
- Germania?

455
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,957
The other one I can't show you. I...

456
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,760
I was run through,
I thought fatally, and...

457
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,878
As I lay there, I...

458
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,837
I wished I could see you again.

459
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,150
Talk to you one last time.

460
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,519
Messala!

461
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,233
Let me show you something.

462
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,869
I may kill your brother one day.

463
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,237
I may kill him first.

464
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,240
You know, your mother
used to interrupt us.

465
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,315
Now you do.

466
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,152
- We have a lot to catch up on.
- Indeed.

467
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,279
It is striking.

468
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,669
Now tell me something
honestly. Look me in the eyes.

469
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,120
How many men does it take
to get you dressed in the morning?

470
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,475
- That's an honest question.
- Yeah.

471
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,551
Doesn't he look just like Zeus?

472
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,955
You know, he's twice as fast, though.

473
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,758
And I knew you'd appreciate him.

474
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,592
Cost me a small fortune.

475
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,188
He really is a beautiful horse.

476
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,508
Yes, he is.

477
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,953
So you spoke with your people.

478
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,036
Yes. I spoke to some of the local rabbis

479
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,000
and opinion makers,
and most of them want peace.

480
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,753
So who's against us?

481
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,472
Some local thugs and radicals.
No one of any importance.

482
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,913
Right, but who?

483
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,078
Messala, they don't matter.

484
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,016
But, Judah, if they don't matter,
then tell me who they are.

485
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,155
What are their names?

486
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,757
I'm not going to name names.

487
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
So you're going to stand idle,

488
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,111
even though you know who the guilty are.

489
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,754
To be honest, no one's guilty of anything
except being sick of Rome's oppression.

490
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,915
Are you aware who's riding to this city?

491
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,038
Did I make that clear?

492
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,912
Death or peace.

493
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,198
I've tried every other way.

494
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,056
And they spit my grandfather's
name in my face

495
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,399
- and ridicule me!
- Oh, my God.

496
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,896
After all these years, you still sound like

497
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,956
that Roman orphan who
turned up on our doorstep.

498
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,190
Judah, you promised to help me!

499
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,840
No, I said I would speak
to the people. And I have.

500
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,753
I don't need you to speak to them.
I need you to sway them.

501
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,068
And if you can't do that,

502
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,071
then I need you to tell me
who our enemies are.

503
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,878
Because we've run out of time.

504
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,278
Judah, please.

505
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,676
Please, I need you to help me.

506
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,072
Messala, I won't be bullied
into this decision.

507
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Judah!

508
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,149
- Messala! Dinner!
- Oh...

509
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,434
Come on, let's get something to eat.

510
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,235
This is how Jerusalem welcomes us?

511
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,357
Tribune Messala has promised
there'll be no trouble.

512
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,712
I've spoken to prominent citizens.

513
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,997
Your safety is their highest priority.

514
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,993
What is that?

515
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,479
- Stay here.
- Why?

516
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,754
Please.

517
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,389
Tirzah?

518
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,277
Tirzah, wait for me.

519
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,355
No!

520
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Sir!

521
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,673
Testudo!

522
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,317
- Testudo!
- Protect!

523
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,789
Shields up!

524
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,993
Ready arrows!

525
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Judah!

526
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,716
Down! Mother, get Tirzah down!

527
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,673
Find the ones who did this and kill them!

528
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,391
You're responsible! Fix it!

529
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,910
Tirzah, move! Get inside. Inside!

530
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,519
Move!

531
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,472
Step aside!

532
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,876
Open this door!

533
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,672
Break down the door.

534
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,157
Open the door!

535
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,469
Open this door!

536
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,959
Dismas!

537
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,269
What have you done?

538
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,715
Do you realize what you've just done?

539
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,536
Then get ready
to down this door!

540
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,278
- Run!
- Take cover!

541
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,152
Go. Go!

542
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,314
We're friends of Rome.

543
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,789
This house is sovereign. This house...

544
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,757
Simonides!

545
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,910
On the ground
with all of them!

546
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,150
- Search every room.
- Mother!

547
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,960
Drag every one
of them in here, now!

548
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,270
I have to speak
to Messala Severus. He knows me!

549
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,510
If they resist, kill them.

550
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,830
- Come with me!
- Please, don't leave them!

551
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,717
- Tirzah!
- Get down here!

552
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,791
What are you doing?
Leave my daughter alone!

553
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,678
Wait, please! Please! No!

554
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,074
Please!

555
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,834
Listen to us!

556
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,433
I'll take all collaborators!

557
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Judah!

558
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,995
Who shot the arrow?

559
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,639
Who shot the arrow?

560
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,197
Who shot...

561
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,438
No, wait! Please!

562
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,589
Wait!

563
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,193
Confess your crime!

564
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,111
We've done nothing.
We've done nothing!

565
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,431
Confess your crime,
or they all stand accused!

566
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,794
Accused of what?

567
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,554
Messala!

568
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,119
Messala, help us!

569
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,791
Messala, please help us!

570
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,677
Search every room!

571
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Messala!

572
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,673
The arrow!

573
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,910
Who shot the arrow?

574
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,152
Who shot the arrow?

575
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,839
Brother, don't!

576
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,513
Ah, here's your friend.

577
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,919
Messala?

578
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,513
Messala, please help us.

579
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,591
So you don't harbor Zealots.

580
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,510
Messala? Messala?

581
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,956
No one here has done anything.
I beg you, please,

582
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,871
defend this house.

583
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,232
You make the order.

584
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,193
It was me.

585
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,111
It was me, I did it. I confess!

586
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,191
Judah, what are you doing?

587
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,278
Please, take me.

588
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,351
My family, they have done nothing wrong.

589
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,958
I confess, please.

590
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,632
He's confessed.

591
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,233
Zealots don't use women, Marcus.

592
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,998
There's no reason to keep them here.

593
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,036
You promised entry without incident.

594
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,195
Did you lie or do you collaborate?

595
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,392
- You're calling me a traitor?
- Messala, what's the order?

596
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,871
Messala, please don't do it.

597
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,719
Take them all.

598
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,673
Take them all!

599
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,791
- Come on then.
- No!

600
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,678
Get up. On your feet.

601
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,909
No!

602
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,520
Be quick about it.
Bring the servants, too.

603
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,152
Please, Messala! No!

604
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,896
Drusus, this is insanity!
You know we've done nothing wrong.

605
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,040
Women to the cross, men to the galleys!

606
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,749
- No! No!
- Judah!

607
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,273
I've taken the blame!

608
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,753
I've taken the blame!
I've taken the blame!

609
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,273
Stop it.

610
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,233
Calm down, Judah!

611
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,109
Stay back.

612
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,434
Stay back!

613
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,556
Stay back! I'll kill him!

614
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,429
I'll kill him.

615
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,713
I swear, I'll kill him!

616
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,632
It won't save them.

617
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,791
Where have they taken them?

618
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,270
- Where are they?
- They're gone.

619
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,598
They're beyond us both.

620
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,233
Step back!

621
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,313
They'll kill them.

622
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,880
Messala, please, I'm begging you.

623
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,069
I begged you!

624
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,071
I asked you
brother-to-brother to help me.

625
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,639
And you chose the traitors over me!

626
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,911
And they betrayed you.

627
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,936
Rome's calling for blood.
I have to give them some.

628
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,279
Look at me, please, brother.

629
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,316
I would never do this to you.
I would never...

630
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,312
You killed them both.

631
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,714
Whatever happens now, you did this!

632
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,833
Keep moving!

633
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,669
All the way back. Back!

634
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,669
Judah!

635
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,388
Judah!

636
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,195
Esther.

637
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,669
Where are you going?

638
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,193
- Hold!
- Please!

639
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,193
- On your feet.
- Please show mercy!

640
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,399
On your feet!

641
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,950
I said on your feet!

642
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,676
- Not here.
- Please, he needs water.

643
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,716
- Please!
- No water for him!

644
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,159
Someone help us.

645
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,509
Drink.

646
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,393
Thank you.

647
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,231
You would do the same.

648
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,958
Get up, Judah.

649
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
- Now.
- Move.

650
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,199
Judah!

651
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,312
- Where are you taking them?
- To the Port of Tyrus.

652
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,318
To the galleys?

653
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,640
- You can't!
- My family.

654
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,113
Judah.

655
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,640
- Move!
- Go on.

656
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,869
Move! Move!

657
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,959
Number 61.

658
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,313
Sit down.

659
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,311
Sit down.

660
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,276
Starboard side clear!

661
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,749
Stand by, bow!

662
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,193
Hands on.

663
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,677
Let's lift the line, oarsmen!

664
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,877
Please, sir, this has been a mistake.

665
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,793
- My family, they're innocent...
- You won't see them again.

666
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Not in this life.

667
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,069
- Put it down!
- Follow me now!

668
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,790
Drum! And...

669
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
Row!

670
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,674
Trident!

671
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
Move!

672
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,719
Wake up!

673
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,633
Quickly.

674
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,435
Ionian water!

675
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,279
Contact imminent!

676
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,232
Give yourselves over to the drum!

677
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,996
Why are we so slow?

678
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,833
We will not lose this battle
before we start.

679
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,838
- Ladder down!
- Coming down!

680
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,472
Prepare for battle!

681
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,232
Full speed! Stick to it!

682
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,119
Oars up.

683
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,039
Oars up!

684
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,511
Why are we so slow?

685
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,355
We need to wake them up.

686
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,433
Change him out.

687
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,714
- No, please. Please, I'm fine.
- Get out!

688
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,279
I'm... Please.

689
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,913
- I said, out!
- Please!

690
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,313
You're done!

691
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,990
- Get out!
- I can row! I am a strong man.

692
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,080
- Give me that!
- I beg you. No, please!

693
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,355
Enough!

694
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,555
No, don't.

695
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,278
Take him out.

696
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,998
Don't care.

697
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,080
Just survive.

698
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,798
Forget about them!

699
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,668
For there is no "you" anymore!

700
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,153
This ship is your body.

701
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,751
That drum is your heartbeat!

702
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,076
And your god

703
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,550
is the glory of Rome!

704
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,029
If this ship goes down,

705
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,999
so do you.

706
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,832
Chains.

707
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,672
Raise the trident!

708
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,797
Free to engage! Quickly!

709
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,949
Ready!

710
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,640
Get ready!

711
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,715
Chains!

712
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
You, too!

713
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,959
Catapults ready!

714
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,273
Fire pit ready! Open the oil barrels!

715
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,033
We should do something.

716
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,997
- We should do something.
- We should.

717
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,516
When they pass,
you should bow your head.

718
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,158
When they strike, take it.

719
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,355
You can't beat them.

720
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,480
Climb the ladder!

721
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,435
All you can do is outlive them.

722
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,353
We ram! We ram hard!

723
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,751
Reverse with everything we have.

724
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,198
Oars!

725
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,874
Sink them.

726
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,316
Not one Greek will step aboard my ship.

727
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,752
Do you understand me?

728
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
Drum!

729
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,436
All together!

730
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,520
And...

731
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,072
Row!

732
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,877
- Catapults.
- Catapults ready!

733
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,514
Fireballs.

734
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
And move!

735
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,239
Let us make this
a glorious day

736
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,319
for Rome!

737
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,309
Battle speed!

738
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,352
Battle speed!

739
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,194
Approaching!

740
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,592
Twenty-nine!

741
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,318
Twenty-eight!

742
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,719
Twenty-seven!

743
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,518
In the pitch!

744
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,235
Twenty-five!

745
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,151
Ramming speed!

746
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,711
Ramming speed!

747
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,598
Twenty-two!

748
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,148
Twenty-one! Twenty!

749
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,515
Ship down
on the starboard side!

750
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,472
Thirteen!

751
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,834
Twelve!

752
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,873
Eleven! Ten!

753
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,279
Blades in!

754
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,831
Brace for impact!

755
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,668
Drum! Where's the drum?

756
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,709
Reverse!

757
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,399
And row!

758
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,312
Greeks on board!

759
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,594
Reverse!

760
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,920
Reverse!

761
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,753
Reverse on my count!

762
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,431
- Help me!
- Die!

763
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,399
Hands on! Hands on oar!

764
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,511
Arrows!

765
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,909
Watch the oil!

766
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,595
Keep rowing
if you want to live!

767
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,835
- All hands on deck!
- Reverse!

768
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,958
Keep rowing!

769
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,468
Pull back!

770
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,913
Heed my drum!

771
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,595
Keep rowing if you want to live!

772
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,628
Get away from me!

773
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,056
All you Romans will die!

774
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,080
Keep rowing!

775
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,196
This is a Greek sea now!

776
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,229
Reverse!

777
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,629
Reverse!

778
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,992
We need to keep moving.

779
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,478
We need to keep moving!

780
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,549
Everyone! Listen to me!
We need to keep moving!

781
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,870
If we stay idle, we all die.

782
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,999
Hands on oars!

783
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,676
Hands on oars! On my count!

784
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,992
And row!

785
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,113
And...

786
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,749
Row!

787
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,274
Together...

788
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,075
And row!

789
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,313
And...

790
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
Row!

791
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,074
And row!

792
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,156
And row!

793
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,708
Battering ram
on the starboard side!

794
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,519
Messala!

795
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,680
Messala, a notice has come
from the Ionian Sea.

796
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,557
The Astroea was lost in battle.

797
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,358
Greek rebels ambushed our ships.

798
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,595
Any survivors?

799
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,398
The entire third fleet is lost.

800
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,358
All are dead to the last man.

801
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,351
Caesar demands that we retaliate.

802
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,469
How long were you
a galley slave?

803
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,078
One never knows.

804
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,356
Dangerous territory.
Pirates and marauders.

805
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,515
And which are you?

806
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,270
The one not in chains.

807
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,916
You wash ashore shackled,
your back striped.

808
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,028
You were a galley slave. How long?

809
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,879
Five years.

810
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,992
What were you accused of?

811
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,069
- I committed no crime.
- And I lay no blame.

812
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,993
I asked what you were accused of.

813
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,719
Sedition.

814
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,150
That's a serious charge.

815
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,560
I'll have to turn you over to the Romans.

816
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,999
No. No.

817
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,833
You are an escaped prisoner.

818
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,036
To do otherwise would put
my camp in jeopardy.

819
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,713
They'll kill me.

820
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,352
I'm sure they will.

821
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,070
We will discharge him
outside the garrison

822
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,388
before we leave for Jerusalem.

823
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,118
Jerusalem.

824
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,952
That's where I'm from.

825
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,998
I have family there.

826
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,833
Your private affairs
are no concern of mine.

827
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,436
You race chariots?

828
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,954
Young men race chariots.

829
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,555
Old men wager on young men
who race chariots.

830
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,792
How will you race
with only three horses?

831
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,916
Aliyah is sick, but that's my dilemma.

832
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,956
No. She's dying.

833
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,432
I can help her.

834
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,798
I know horses.

835
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,192
I've seen it before. It's called farcy.

836
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,075
It can be treated with charcoal.

837
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,513
I can help her.

838
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,835
All I ask in return,

839
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,558
take me with you.

840
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,992
Let me find my family.

841
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,960
Or at least let me find out
what happened to them.

842
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,272
What is your name?

843
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,749
Judah.

844
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,273
Judah Ben-Hur.

845
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,513
The bargain is this, Judah Ben-Hur.

846
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,195
You owe me your life.

847
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,560
I expect that bill to be paid.

848
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,079
Release him.

849
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,632
Kill the leper!

850
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,073
Look at yourself!

851
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,313
Kill the leper!

852
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,038
Don't! Please don't!

853
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,356
- This man is your neighbor.
- Wait!

854
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,397
- The Torah tells us to...
- Wait! Stop!

855
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,550
...love your neighbor
as we love ourselves.

856
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,916
Wait. Stop! Stop!

857
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,353
Stop. Stop.

858
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,670
Hate, anger, fear.

859
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,399
Those are lies they
use to turn you against each other.

860
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,716
When you set aside the hate
they force you to carry,

861
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,072
that's when you know

862
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,556
love is our true nature.

863
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,470
Do you see what's
happening here?

864
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,795
Mark my words, Messala,
this is the poison.

865
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,348
But that man offers
the people something more,

866
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,829
and calms them with compassion.

867
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,990
This Jesus of Nazareth

868
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,277
is more dangerous
than all of the Zealots combined.

869
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,396
Wake up. Come on.

870
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,630
Up we go, come on. Up. Up.

871
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,038
Up we go. Good girl.

872
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,196
Up we go. Come on. Come on.

873
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,309
Ilderim.

874
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,553
Good girl. Good girl.

875
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,677
Good girl. Here we are.

876
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,759
Here we are.

877
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,833
Good girl.

878
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,675
She looks well.

879
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,318
No, not yet.

880
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,789
She is taking the charcoal, though.

881
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,552
Very nice.

882
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,828
Aliyah.

883
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,359
I had one just like her.

884
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,316
- Did you now?
- Yes.

885
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,988
So you do know something about horses.

886
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
Thank you,

887
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,513
Judah Ben-Hur.

888
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,560
They're harnessed wrong.
Aliyah should be here.

889
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,720
Kadeem?

890
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,952
Mind your business.

891
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,640
Listen to me.
If you take them into a gallop...

892
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,792
Judah.

893
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,598
...they're going to bolt.

894
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,949
The horses! Get the horses!

895
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,800
Stop those horses!

896
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,560
- Stay away! Stay away!
- Hold it! Hold it!

897
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,988
Ilderim, be careful.

898
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,672
Ilderim, move out of the way!

899
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,233
Whoa, now! Whoa!

900
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,795
Get out of the way!

901
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,600
Kadeem!

902
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,189
Aliyah!

903
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,430
Stop! Stop! Stop her!

904
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,512
- Kadeem!
- Hold it! Hold it!

905
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,673
- Aliyah!
- Judah, no!

906
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,034
Aliyah... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

907
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,639
No, Judah!

908
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,120
Hang on!

909
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,718
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aliyah.

910
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,308
Here, take the reins.

911
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,308
Is she hurt?

912
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,436
Oh. Oh, Aliyah. Shh.

913
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,555
It's all right.

914
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,432
- You're fine.
- Easy, girl. Easy.

915
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,040
- Easy, girl. Shh.
- How did you know?

916
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,830
I told him Aliyah should be on the inside.

917
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,396
She hasn't run in a while.
She couldn't keep the pace.

918
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,148
When she broke stride,
she incited the others.

919
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,640
Kadeem.

920
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,680
How's he?

921
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,439
Not good.

922
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,835
How is it you weren't put
directly to the sword?

923
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,471
I was born to station.

924
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,752
A rich Jew sentenced to a slow death.

925
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,390
I imagine there were many in Rome who
found that very entertaining.

926
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,789
Was there ever a kind
more obsessed with the obscene?

927
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,556
People starve, the masses are enslaved,

928
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,311
and Caesar answers with
less bread and more circuses.

929
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,517
But I can't complain.

930
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,391
Their excessive nature lines my purses.

931
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,875
Is that why you're going to Jerusalem?

932
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,994
There'll be opportunities to race.

933
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,278
The Prefect is celebrating
himself with a tremendous circus

934
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,715
and his champion, Messala.

935
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,349
Messala Severus?

936
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,936
- I hope this keeps you warm.
- Thank you.

937
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,598
My love to your family.

938
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,354
- Thank you.
- God bless you.

939
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,228
Esther.

940
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,951
Good to see you, Simon. God bless you.

941
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,278
Esther, what is it?

942
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,799
My husband.

943
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,158
Oh, I've missed you.

944
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,951
I've missed you so much.

945
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,874
Oh, Judah.

946
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,477
Judah. Judah.

947
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,915
Judah.

948
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,791
I shouldn't have run.

949
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,791
They would have killed you, too.

950
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,430
I would have died with my family.

951
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,512
That's better than
being alone with my guilt.

952
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,554
I've filled my life in other ways.

953
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,159
By serving others?

954
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,159
I've found people to care for.
People who care for me.

955
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,670
When I can, I spread the Word.

956
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,958
The message of Jesus.

957
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,631
That carpenter, he showed you kindness

958
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,199
when no one else would.

959
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,352
I've seen him do acts of grace so small,

960
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,960
but so much more than other people do.

961
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,360
Every day for five years
I asked myself the same questions.

962
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,511
What happened to you?

963
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,679
What happened
to my mother and sister?

964
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,439
Were they crucified?

965
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,838
Where are they buried?

966
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,479
I don't know.

967
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,872
Someone must know.

968
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,474
Messala.

969
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,516
He's become the pride of Roman Judea.

970
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,000
He's the commander of the garrison,

971
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,310
races chariots in Caesar's name.

972
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
You couldn't go near him.

973
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,272
You won't go near him.

974
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,875
Get up.

975
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,976
You can't stay in Jerusalem.
This isn't the place...

976
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,696
No, no, no, I'm safe. I'm staying
in a cabin outside the garden gate.

977
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,029
I will find
a way for us if that's what you still want.

978
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,318
Wait to hear from me.

979
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,320
Judah?

980
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,992
So, charlatans,
religious indoctrinators,

981
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,554
holy men.

982
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,631
We will work with local people.

983
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,756
We will make arrests.

984
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,278
Anyone who doesn't get the message,

985
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,112
we'll find an answer for.

986
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,200
What's this?

987
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,511
A gift brought by a messenger
with an invitation to meet.

988
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,068
- Meet where?
- He said you would know.

989
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,550
Have no fear of the Zealots.

990
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,755
They fight, they disrupt.

991
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,630
I haven't changed that much,
have I, brother?

992
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,313
What do you want?

993
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,872
Where is my mother and sister?

994
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,999
They're dead.

995
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,317
It was a quick death?

996
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,357
Where are they buried?

997
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,195
You forced my hand, Judah.

998
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,995
You chose the Zealots over me.

999
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,991
Listen, Judah, your pride...

1000
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,593
Onwards! Quickly!

1001
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,120
Surround this house!

1002
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,640
Walk through the portal!

1003
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,720
Coward.

1004
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,793
Catch him! Do not let him escape!

1005
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,600
Esther.

1006
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,750
Faith brought you back to me.

1007
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,434
The same faith that kept you alive.

1008
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,792
That wasn't faith.

1009
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,476
Faith wasn't strong enough.

1010
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,079
That was hate.

1011
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,278
I became hate.

1012
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,716
That's what kept me alive.

1013
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,911
Let Messala go.

1014
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,715
Don't you see
we've been given a second chance?

1015
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,875
Spend it on hatred,
then you're still a slave.

1016
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,557
What else do I have?

1017
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,759
Me.

1018
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,718
You have me.

1019
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,831
Messala was down
when we entered.

1020
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,515
There was at least one man.
He escaped over this balcony.

1021
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,031
Were they Zealots?

1022
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,997
I don't know, Prefect.

1023
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,711
And at the house of Hur.

1024
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,872
You were in uniform.

1025
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,031
An attack on you is an attack on Rome.

1026
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,396
An example needs to be made.

1027
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,960
What's the value of a Jew to a Roman?

1028
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,109
Ten to one.

1029
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,429
Twenty, I would say.

1030
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,830
Pull twenty Jews from the streets.

1031
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,314
Execute them
in the name of the Emperor.

1032
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,635
And let the people know, Messala,

1033
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,271
the days of forgiveness are behind them.

1034
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,278
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

1035
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,789
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

1036
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,096
What are doing?
We've done nothing!

1037
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,416
- Marcus!
- ...17, 18, 19.

1038
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,078
I have two!

1039
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,237
We have 19! Take one, leave the other!

1040
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,315
Judah!

1041
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,798
Have you been to the hillside?

1042
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,600
Have you seen the twenty
they've crucified?

1043
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,114
What twenty?

1044
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,158
There's talk. A Roman
attacked at the house of Hur.

1045
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,909
You did that.

1046
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,400
If people are dead, that's on Rome.

1047
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,754
You tried to kill Messala.

1048
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,793
I told you to stay away from him, Judah.
I warned you!

1049
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,873
I won't let him
go unpunished for what he's done to us.

1050
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,995
I can't.

1051
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,275
I watched my father be killed.

1052
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,000
I know what it's like to
want to take your feelings out on others.

1053
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,591
They deserve justice
for what's happened to them.

1054
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,550
There's nothing here for you anymore.

1055
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,834
Nothing.

1056
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,190
Know the world you live in, Judah.

1057
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,516
The world you live in is Rome's.

1058
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,435
Their laws.

1059
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,873
Their power.

1060
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,999
You cannot fight them in the streets.

1061
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,192
But there is another way.

1062
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,313
The circus.

1063
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,480
In the circus,

1064
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,078
there is no law.

1065
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,275
There is no right,

1066
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,759
no wrong.

1067
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,879
What happens there is sport,

1068
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,154
not vengeance.

1069
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,598
Do as you please.

1070
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,956
Give them a show,
the people will cheer you.

1071
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,430
How pathetic it must be
when your sole motivator is greed.

1072
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,436
You feed my beauties.

1073
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,876
Don't think you know me.

1074
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,308
Five years in the gut of a slave ship.

1075
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,231
I know what motivates.

1076
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,795
Five years of pain
after twenty of privilege,

1077
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,236
and now you think you know
something about suffering.

1078
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,068
Your situation is not unique, Judah.

1079
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,838
Neither are you.

1080
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,639
My son spoke up for liberation.

1081
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,792
He was branded a rebel.

1082
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,718
Dragged through the streets,
his throat slit like a hog.

1083
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,796
I traveled my
"all Romans must die" phase,

1084
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,108
same as you.

1085
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,430
All Romans won't die.

1086
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,078
They can't die.

1087
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,268
You can't kill them quickly enough.

1088
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,076
If Messala is the pride of Rome,

1089
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,798
take their pride.

1090
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,831
Beat him in their circus.

1091
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,034
Give them a shame they will understand.

1092
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,552
I was accused.

1093
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,472
I'm meant to be dead.

1094
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,473
They won't let me race.

1095
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,797
They're Romans, Judah.

1096
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,631
For the right price,
they'll let you do anything.

1097
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,118
I bring greetings
and congratulations

1098
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,111
on the opening of your games, Prefect.

1099
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,035
This is a private gathering,
old man. Move on.

1100
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,671
I'm not here to cause trouble.

1101
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,834
Same as you, I'm here
for the love of sport.

1102
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,791
So, where do I have to go to make a bet?

1103
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,195
What's the wager?

1104
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,319
My chariot.

1105
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,876
The entries are long closed.

1106
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,790
Three thousand gold pieces.

1107
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,230
That enough to make you reconsider?

1108
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,153
If that's not enough, how about this?

1109
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,833
I'll give 3-to-1 odds on all bets.

1110
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,472
My book is open.

1111
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,516
That's very generous
against a strong field.

1112
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,756
I'm not betting the field.

1113
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,434
I'm betting that my driver
will be victorious over

1114
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,589
Messala.

1115
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,635
A bet like that's not customary.

1116
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,352
And it's not appropriate.

1117
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,919
Not appropriate for who?

1118
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,712
All of those citizens who stand to
gain when you beat my man?

1119
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,590
You will beat him, won't you?

1120
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,398
He's just a Jew.

1121
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,680
Oh, I'm sorry. I failed to mention that.

1122
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,469
But you've crushed an entire people.

1123
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,950
I should think
crushing one man wouldn't be difficult.

1124
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,350
You're on soft ground.

1125
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,113
My money

1126
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,911
against your pride.

1127
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,433
Seems even.

1128
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,472
3-to-1 not enough? How about 6-to-1?

1129
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,199
With the agreement

1130
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,230
that should my driver cross the line first,

1131
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,472
any and all claims against him are quit.

1132
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,513
Any, and all.

1133
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,309
Good.

1134
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,276
I will leave this with you

1135
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,918
until the race is settled.

1136
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,470
African! What's the name of the driver?

1137
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,872
You know his name.

1138
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:29,640
Judah!

1139
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,631
Shorten those reins!

1140
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,393
Go, go, go!

1141
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,308
Go!

1142
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,108
Step forward!

1143
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,879
Good. Steady.

1144
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,149
Okay.

1145
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,469
Okay.

1146
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,079
Good. It will get better.

1147
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,633
I couldn't see anything.

1148
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,160
In the circus,

1149
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,476
be aware of the drivers' tricks.

1150
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,074
Two riders part,
suck you in between them,

1151
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,957
and crush you under their wheels.

1152
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,075
It's called the "gate."

1153
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,957
I just need to get to Messala.

1154
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:15,191
Well, you think they're just
gonna give it to you?

1155
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,716
No. The circus is a blood sport,

1156
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,994
but it is sport.

1157
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,753
There is strategy,
and you have to know it.

1158
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,389
Good?

1159
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,800
Esther.

1160
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,376
Esther, I need to ask something of you.

1161
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,958
There's nothing to speak of.

1162
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,712
I'm going to race Messala in the circus.

1163
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,871
It's the only way to end this.

1164
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,360
Please.

1165
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,159
You always cared deeply for my family.

1166
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,078
If you ever find their graves,

1167
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,597
bury us together, put us all to rest.

1168
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,956
Judah, you can't give up hope.

1169
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,235
You must believe there's a better way.

1170
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,593
There's not.

1171
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,592
Messala rides like the devil.

1172
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,910
He will do whatever he must to win.

1173
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:22,268
Now, when you cut first,
they'll tend to put you up on one wheel.

1174
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,635
So, you have to learn how to tilt.

1175
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,551
It's all about balance, Judah.

1176
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,915
It's a dangerous maneuver, of course,

1177
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,759
but with courage and practice,
it can be mastered.

1178
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,995
This is the spina.

1179
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,518
This is where I'll be.

1180
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,192
And I will try to guide you.

1181
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,752
Now, when the race begins,
do not try to take the lead.

1182
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,234
Lay back.
Let the other drivers fight for position.

1183
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,536
- And the best strategy...
- But if I'm in the back,

1184
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,152
how do I get to him?

1185
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,798
The race will bring him to you.

1186
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,756
With each successive lap,

1187
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,480
there will be fewer and fewer chariots.

1188
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,157
Which is why it's important
for you to stay back.

1189
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:10,151
And remember, Judah, first to finish,

1190
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,952
last to die.

1191
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,475
Messala.

1192
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,034
She wants you.

1193
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,233
Messala! Messala!

1194
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,320
Calm down.

1195
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,398
Messala! Messala! Messala!

1196
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,910
Messala! Messala!

1197
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,634
You can't race him.

1198
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,679
There's no stopping it.

1199
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,474
I'm asking you to remember
that Judah is your brother.

1200
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,752
The Hurs are your family.

1201
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,273
My past is lost to me.

1202
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,390
Each one of us has a choice.

1203
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,237
You and Judah can make things right.

1204
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,874
How?

1205
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,188
Disqualify him,

1206
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,032
or, disqualify yourself.

1207
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,879
And be branded as a coward?
I'll die first.

1208
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,039
Yes, one of you will die.

1209
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,395
There is no victory in this.

1210
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,911
Oh, so, you've come
to ask for my public humiliation.

1211
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,398
No, Messala.

1212
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,234
I've come to tell you
of the hell you'll unleash.

1213
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,554
God punishes just as God forgives.

1214
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,636
We have different gods.

1215
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:40,720
Marcus!

1216
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,353
She's asking for too much.

1217
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,469
Judah.

1218
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,034
Get up.

1219
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,228
You recognize him?

1220
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:14,720
No.

1221
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,875
Then he's a thief.

1222
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,672
Take him, and give him a thief's reward.

1223
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,876
No, Judah Ben-Hur.

1224
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,599
You don't remember.

1225
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,991
I remember you.

1226
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,275
You never forget a man
who's held a knife to your throat.

1227
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,634
I'll kill him!

1228
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,755
I'll kill him! I swear!

1229
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,030
Drusus. What's happened to you?

1230
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,236
I know where your family is.

1231
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,149
- My family are dead.
- No, they're not.

1232
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,355
He's lying.

1233
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,670
Rome doesn't keep prisoners,
it executes them.

1234
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,474
Pilate ordered your family to be crucified,

1235
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,640
but I had them intercepted.

1236
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,315
Sent to the caves at Timnath-Serah.

1237
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,153
Please, pay me,

1238
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,829
and I can take you to your family.

1239
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,354
I have to go with him.

1240
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,438
Ilderim, you must allow me this.

1241
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,715
I beg you. If there's even
a chance they're alive...

1242
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,114
They are.

1243
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Let him up.

1244
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,278
Prepare a horse for him.

1245
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,715
I'll be back, I swear.

1246
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,791
- Take this.
- What for?

1247
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,235
He's a Roman.
That's all the reason you need.

1248
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,789
Why would you save them?

1249
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,395
I did it for Messala.
He cherished your sister.

1250
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,152
If he wouldn't save her himself,

1251
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,435
then I would save him
from his own mistake.

1252
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,320
Judah, please, wait.

1253
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,594
Mother?

1254
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,916
Oh, my God, you're alive.

1255
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,636
Mother, it's me. It's Judah.

1256
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,393
It's Judah.

1257
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,348
Judah?

1258
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,119
It's Judah.

1259
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,680
It's your son.

1260
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,631
I miss my boy.

1261
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,109
- Mother, I'm here.
- No.

1262
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,475
He's outside playing in the sun.

1263
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,315
No, I'm Judah. I'm Judah.

1264
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,233
You can't help us.

1265
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,319
Tirzah, what's happened?

1266
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,311
If you love us, forget about us.

1267
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,400
What's happened?

1268
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,856
- You are not my boy!
- Mother, what's wrong?

1269
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:44,880
We're lepers. Get out.

1270
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,840
- We're unclean, Judah!
- We're lepers!

1271
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,136
- Get him out now!
- We're lepers!

1272
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,216
- Get him out! Get him out!
- Judah, get out!

1273
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,514
- Go away!
- Get him out!

1274
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,953
You go away!

1275
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,152
Gesius, they are dying. Let us take them.

1276
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,991
- They have leprosy.
- Judah, please.

1277
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,231
I did what I could. It's better this way...

1278
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,878
I'll be back for them.

1279
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,896
They're lepers,
they'd be stoned in the street!

1280
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,194
I will be back for you!

1281
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,231
Judah, I tried.
I saved them. I saved them!

1282
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,429
You didn't save them!

1283
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,829
You condemned them
to a life worse than death.

1284
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,878
A life worse than death!

1285
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,390
He'll pay for what he's done to us.

1286
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,395
People of Jerusalem.

1287
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,076
Friends of Rome!

1288
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:10,239
We celebrate the power of man!

1289
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,159
You idiot!

1290
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,389
Get it now!

1291
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,277
Men gathered here today

1292
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,594
hailing from Persia,

1293
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,358
Greece,

1294
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,998
Arabia,

1295
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,079
Syria...

1296
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,832
...Ethiopia,

1297
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,713
Egypt,

1298
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,599
Judea.

1299
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,435
And the unbeaten

1300
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,919
Rome!

1301
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,834
Going to run this. One time.

1302
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,831
Good girl. Good girl.

1303
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,115
We pay tribute to Caesar

1304
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:07,072
and give thanks for his
virtue and his mercy

1305
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,716
in this circus.

1306
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,634
A grand arena, ten years in the making.

1307
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,510
You will have the pleasure...

1308
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,068
...for the first time in Judean history.

1309
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,360
Ready?

1310
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,351
Don't look so worried.

1311
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,148
This wise old man once told me,

1312
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,800
"First to finish, last to die."

1313
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,479
Good advice.

1314
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,832
You will see them race for glory.

1315
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,472
You will see them fight for honor.

1316
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,915
You will see them die for you!

1317
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,913
You should have stayed away.

1318
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,792
You should have killed me.

1319
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,028
I will.

1320
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:40,589
Judah! Judah! Pull back! Pull back!

1321
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,189
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1322
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,879
What is going on?

1323
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,912
Enjoy this lap!

1324
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:14,912
I'll kill you on the next one!

1325
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,800
Get back!

1326
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,909
My helmet.

1327
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,795
Hurry up!

1328
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,551
The "gate," Judah! The "gate"!

1329
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,679
Good move, Judah. Good move.

1330
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,190
Another trick for you!

1331
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,634
Fetch him! Fetch him!

1332
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,438
Move him! Come on, move him!

1333
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,238
Quick, get him on the rack.

1334
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,033
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1335
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:28,120
Come on! Come on.

1336
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,428
Stand back! Stand back!

1337
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,033
Hurry up! Move!

1338
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,270
- Out of the way!
- Back up!

1339
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,588
Get us up there!

1340
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,816
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

1341
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,955
Hurry!

1342
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,752
I'll kill you!

1343
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,717
Are you not Roman?

1344
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,711
Come on, Messala!

1345
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,515
Horses!

1346
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,588
Go, Aliyah!

1347
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,795
Go, go!

1348
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:26,872
Judah! Judah! Judah! Judah!

1349
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,391
Judah! Judah! Judah!

1350
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,709
Judah! Judah!

1351
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,034
- No shame to be second!
- We're riding now!

1352
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,908
Come on! Come on!

1353
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,069
Come on!

1354
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,551
Are we having fun now, brother?

1355
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,593
Messala!

1356
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,910
Judah! Judah! Judah!

1357
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,797
And row!

1358
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,600
Yes!

1359
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,435
Go!

1360
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,240
Move!

1361
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,798
Shorten up your reins, Judah!

1362
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,197
Judah! Judah! Judah!

1363
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,280
Come on, Judah.

1364
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,400
Kill him!

1365
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,434
Messala, kill him!

1366
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,319
Judah!

1367
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,550
Judah! Judah! Judah!

1368
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:37,993
Judah! Judah!

1369
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,271
Judah! Judah! Judah!

1370
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,596
Wait. Wait!

1371
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,192
Congratulations, African.

1372
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:40,680
Take your winnings.

1373
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,992
Condolences on your loss.

1374
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,080
Loss?

1375
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,393
Look at them.

1376
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,592
They want blood.

1377
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,871
They're all Romans now.

1378
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,149
Judah?

1379
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,359
What's wrong?

1380
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,391
You've won! You should be celebrating.

1381
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,836
Do you know what's ahead for us?

1382
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:06,432
The riches we can make in Rome? Eh?

1383
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,430
Wandering around the desert
with nothing, for nothing.

1384
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,518
What kind of life is that?

1385
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,554
It's something other than loneliness.

1386
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,676
It's the only life I know.

1387
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,510
Find something for yourself.

1388
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:26,640
Peter.

1389
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:46,160
Jesus!

1390
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,595
Soldiers!

1391
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:54,110
- Jesus of Nazareth...
- Stop!

1392
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,920
In the name of Caesar,
you are under arrest.

1393
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,914
Peter! Peter! No trouble.

1394
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,111
Not from any of you.

1395
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:05,113
Those who live by the sword,
will die by the sword.

1396
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,435
Jesus! Jesus!

1397
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,836
Dear Lord, please help us!

1398
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,717
He's our Savior! Please let him go!

1399
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,639
Please help!

1400
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,158
Esther!

1401
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:24,514
Esther!

1402
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,240
Esther!

1403
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,754
You heard him, stand back!

1404
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:31,429
Esther?

1405
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:35,355
Esther? Esther?

1406
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,998
Impostor!

1407
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,275
Move!

1408
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,438
No water for him.

1409
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,313
No water for him!

1410
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:08,109
Drink. Please drink.

1411
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,238
No water for him!

1412
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:16,994
No, Judah.

1413
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:20,478
My life,

1414
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,597
I give it of my own free will.

1415
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:47,640
Someone should help him.

1416
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,032
I thought you were
the son of God!

1417
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:57,554
Put him to death!

1418
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:00,359
You'll get what you deserve!

1419
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:17,068
We deserve to die
for our crimes!

1420
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:20,119
But this man has done nothing wrong!

1421
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,720
Jesus?

1422
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:26,712
Remember me when you come
into your kingdom.

1423
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:33,392
Today, you will be with me in paradise.

1424
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,199
Father,

1425
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,359
forgive them,

1426
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,754
for they know not what they do.

1427
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,229
It's

1428
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:07,040
finished.

1429
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,109
Come on.

1430
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,477
That's it! Come on!
Let's move out!

1431
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:37,760
Come on!

1432
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,029
We're healed.

1433
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,874
Judah...

1434
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,032
How could this be?

1435
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:08,399
I will take them.

1436
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:13,040
Come.

1437
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,714
You are free.

1438
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:24,991
I lost him.

1439
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,479
I've lost my brother.

1440
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,232
No, you must have faith, Judah.

1441
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,953
I see you.

1442
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,835
Don't stand so far away. Come close.

1443
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,233
Come see what you did to me.

1444
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,711
I won't go that easy.

1445
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:29,190
As long as I live, I'll claw at you.

1446
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,794
And if I die, I'll drag you
beneath the ground beside me!

1447
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,630
With the last of me,
I'll choke the life from you!

1448
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,720
No.

1449
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,320
I'll make myself whole again, I swear,

1450
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,634
and when I do, I'll kill you!

1451
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,878
- No more killing.
- You did this to me!

1452
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:43,235
- No more slaughter.
- You did this!

1453
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,790
Remember when we were young?

1454
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,831
When I was hurt and you carried me

1455
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,074
with all your strength
for as long as you could.

1456
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,836
I can't fight anymore.

1457
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,991
I can't hate anymore.

1458
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,159
All I can do is carry you.

1459
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:16,519
Oh, Judah, forgive me.

1460
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,958
No, forgive me.

1461
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:21,153
Forgive me.

1462
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,080
There were
many miracles that day,

1463
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,317
and in the days that followed.

1464
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,154
As time passed,

1465
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,708
forgiveness and understanding
had reunited the family.

1466
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,512
To give hope and promise
for a better way.

1467
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,630
To fight the good fight,

1468
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:55,720
to finish the race,

1469
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,676
to keep the faith.

1470
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:14,031
Don't look back, J udah.

1471
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,397
Your whole life is ahead of you.

1472
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:22,194
You ready, brother?

1473
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:23,912
Hmm?

I'm in the kitchen!Jan, Spencer!In the kitchen!Dad, are you on a ladder?- What are you doing?
- Grandpa.- What's it look like?
- Get down.I'm changing your light bulb.I leave for 10 minutes,
you're climbing ladders?Don't think
you should be doing that.You think I can't
change a light bulb?- Okay.
- There.Ugh! No, no, no.- I got it. I'm fine.
- Okay.Hey, kiddo!Hey, how's New York City?- It's great.
- How's school?It's okay. How you doing?I'm terrific. I don't
even know what I'm doing here.You're recovering
from hip surgery.Meh! I'll be out
of here in no time.It's not a prison.I wanna get back
to my apartment.- Is that so terrible?
- Your apartment? It's terrible.Is it really cold in here?The downstairs heater
isn't working.- The guy's coming in the morning.
- It's like a goddamn icebox.Did you ever call Milo?What? No.Dad. He's called five times.
Just call him back.I'm not calling him back.
I don't wanna talk to him.Come on, I'll help you
with your bags.[SIGHS]Oh, you're staying in here.We're roommates.Yeah. I could just stay
downstairs on the couch.- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- If you want, yeah.It's a couple weeks.
It's gonna be fine.Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.- Oh! You're gonna...
- Whoa![GROANING]- You okay?
- Don't tell your mother!This goes there. There.That's in there.- All right, let's try it.
- Okay, let's see.All right, so there's that.There's this. There's this.The blue light, the red,
the green light.Oh, look at you two.
How sweet is this?Okay, I have to leave for work
before either of you gets up.The heater guy's
coming in the morning.I'm gonna meet
my friends for brunch at 10.That'll be nice.
Where are you going?- Um... Nora's.
- What are you going there for?All the restaurants
in Brantford,- you gotta go to that one?
- I didn't pick.What difference does it make?
It's been years.I love you, honey.
I'm so glad you're home.SPENCER:
Love you too, Mom.[SIGHS]Getting old sucks. Don't let
anybody tell you any different.You still got
that little girlfriend?No.We're not together anymore.I don't think.Was it her or you?- It's complicated.
- Try me.We'll see
if I can understand.Well, when we
first got together,we were...sort of different people
than we are now.I mean, last year was...amazing.I was a senior in high school.I had a girlfriend.Like, I finally figured out
who I was or something.Mm.I wish I could just feel
like that again, I guess.[SIGHS]I don't know.Long-distance
relationships are hard.I mean, I know everybody says
that, but turns out it's true.Can I give you a little advice?
Listen to me.Every single day
on every single subway car,there's lots of ladies
in New York City.And one in five of them, I would
marry, no questions asked.This is the best time
of your life.- It is?
- Yes, it is.So pull it together! It doesn't
get any better than this.It's all downhill from here.[âªâªâª][SNORING][MACHINE BUBBLING][SHUDDERING]Bravestone.[âªâªâª][âªâªâª][DOOR BELLS JINGLING]BOTH:
Hi!Yay, yay, yay!- Ooh!
- Oh, gosh, how are you?- Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- Thank you.Ho, ho, ho!- Fridge.
- Fridge!- Come here.
- Ooh!So we were building houses
for two months,and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica,which was also amazing.That is so awesome.
I am so happy for you.That is so cool.So, "M," that's what
we're supposed to call you now?You don't have to.
It's just a nickname.One of my college friends
gave me that.You don't have to call me that.M. I love it. It's so hot.- Okay.
- But you and Spencer,- you're still not...?
- Yeah. No. Um, we're...We're still,
like, taking a break.Where is he, by the way?[MACHINE BUBBLING][DOORBELL RINGS][EDDIE SNORING QUIETLY][DOORBELL RINGS][GROANS][âªâªâª]Eh, Christ.What do you want, Milo?Nice to see you too.Yes, I'd love to come in
for a cup of coffee.Thanks for asking.[âªâªâª]You mind if I make some eggs?Do whatever you want.
I don't care.Just hurry up.
I don't have all day.You going somewhere?Have, um...?Have you been in touch
with Spencer much?Yeah...You know what?Not really, actually.I text him a lot, but
he doesn't always text me back.- I know.
- FRIDGE: It's just...I've been crazed latelywith, you know,
classes and practices,and I got games
on the weekends.Yeah. Totally. Totally.I've just... I've been... I've
been a little worried about him.Okay, look, where...?
Where is this guy? For real.Good?- Meh.
- What do you mean, "Meh"?Meh! What do you want already?You've been calling
and calling.You show up out of the blue
after 15 years.Why? 'Cause you wanna
make some eggs?[CHUCKLING]You remember
when we first opened,we had that
little dishwasher, Morris?Yeah, of course
I remember Morris.Worked the dinner shift.Six days a week,
2 in the morning most nights.- The dishwasher.
- Little Morris. Mm.He wouldn't even touch those
saucepans until he was donewith every single utensil
in the bin.[CHUCKLING]Yeah, the man knew his craft.Little Morris.Well, get... Wha...Just get to it, would you?I mean, it's always
the scenic route with you.I know what you want,
you want to apologize.And I hate to tell you,
I'm not interested.[DOORBELL RINGS]You think I'm supposed
to apologize?[KNOCKING AT DOOR]Oh, heater guy.- Grandpa Eddie?
- Anthony?Yes, sir, it's me.Anthony!How are you?Come on in. Come on in.- How you doing?
- Oh, getting old sucks.Don't let anybody
tell you any different.Heh, heh. Oh, uh, this is
uh, Martha and-and Bethany.This is Spencer's
grandfather, Eddie.Martha?
You're the little girlfriend.- Uh...
- Morning!Morning, sir.
Sorry to barge in on you.You're not barging.
He's barging.Milo Walker.Wait, Milo? Like...
Like Milo and Eddie's.- Pleased to meet you.
- Man, my dad saidyou guys had
the best restaurant.We were just there.
Well, it's called Nora's now.Pfft, Nora's.
It's barely even a restaurant.It's more like
a breakfast place now.Were you with Spencer?No, we came here
looking for him, actually.You all hungry?
Eggs on the griddle.- Might have to take a look.
- Hey, man,you can do more
than take a look at it.FRIDGE:
All right, all right. My man.- Whoa. Do you need a hand?
- Do I look like I need a hand?BETHANY:
Martha?Hey.Where is he?[RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT PLAYS]- Do you hear that?
- Yes.[RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT CONTINUES]You hear something?It's probably the heater.
It's broken.[DRUMBEAT STOPS]How did it
even get here?I don't know.Maybe he...
I don't know,maybe he went back for it
or something?Is he trying
to fix it?Why would anyone
try to fix that thing?I don't know.I don't know. Maybe he went
to buy parts or something?Okay, look,
I'm calling him again.I'm sure everything's... fine.[PHONE BUZZING]Fourteen texts
and four missed calls.I don't think he went out.I think...I think he went back in.No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no...- What? No. Why...?
- FRIDGE: Come on, man!BETHANY:
Why would he do that?FRIDGE:
Remember what it was like?- I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
- I got killed by a piece of cake!Guys, guys.How is he gonna get out?Uh, he's gotta take the...
The green jewel.And stick it back
in the statue thing.By himself?[SIGHS]We gotta go get him.Are you crazy?- I'm coming with you.
- Are you out of your minds?We can do this. We've been
there. We know what to expect.I gotta stop hanging out
with white people.I don't know what's
wrong with me.She's right. We played
before and we won.We barely survived!You know
he would do it for you.For any of us.[âªâªâª]Be careful.
It looks pretty busted.- [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING]
- [MARTHA & FRIDGE GASP]NIGEL [OVER TV]:
<i>Welcome to Jumanji.</i>What...? We haven't even
picked our guys yet!What?Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I
hate this part. All right. Okay.This is not happening!You guys?[âªâªâª][PANTING HEAVILY]No![SCREAMS][ANIMALS CHITTERING][BREATHING HEAVILY]Am I...?Is it...? I can't believe...Oh![GASPS]Oh, it's her.I'm her.[âªâªâª]Spencer.Spencer?[GRUNTS]What in tarnation?Where am I?What the hell is this?Oh, my God.Eddie?- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?Milo?What on earth? What...?[GASPS]- What the...?
- Oh, my.Wait a minute.Oh, Lord.- This isn't happening.
- Pardon me?- Who are you?
- You're Spencer's grandfather.- Yeah, no kidding.
- And you are Milo.I certainly am.I'm Martha, Spencer's...- You're the little girlfriend?
- [RUSTLING]- Look out!
- What?- [YELLING]
- [GRUNTS]- Ah! Oh, oh!
- Oh, Lord.That hurt like a goddamn...- Bethany?

This can't be happening!Fridge?Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it!The hell, man?Okay.
Okay, something went wrong.You think?Holy...Wait. If I'm...Then you...? Spencer?Why does everybody
keep calling me Spencer?No, that is Grandpa Eddie.
And that, heh... is Milo.Pleased to meet you.What?Then where's Bethany?
And where's Spencer?I don't know! Okay?The game, it didn't
let us pick our avatars, so...- Because it's busted!
- Yeah, okay.Are we dead?You know, I was just
wondering the same thing.Did I die and turn intosome kind of a small,
muscular Boy Scout?- We're not dead.
- So then what's going on here?Okay, this is gonna sound
very, uh, strange,but we are in
a video game called <i>Jumanji,</i>and we are in the bodies
of video game characters, heh.And we've been here before,
Fridge and I.- Last time, I was you.
- Mm.- Huh?
- We're in a game!We gotta find Spencer
'cause he's in here too.- Spencer?
- Yes.- He's here?
- Yes.Spencer, Eddie's grandson?Yes. Spencer.- He's here too?
- MARTHA & FRIDGE: Yes!He's here,
and we gotta find him.So it's like
a hide-and-go-seek situation.I'm not "it."Hm...My hip feels
pretty good now.Oh, my joints
feel like butter.- Oh, yeah, look at those.
- Wow.Look at these.
Look at what I got.- Uh, we have some issues here.
- You're telling me this?I'm the old fat dude.I came back, and things
actually got worse.At least last time
I was still black.Well, look at
this little fella.Hello there. Heh.Mr. Walker, don't get
too close to the water!- Get away from there!
- I'm sorry, what'd you say now?[ROARING][GASPS]Hey! Ahh!Get on out of here![GRUNTING]MOUSE:
What just happened?What the hell
was that thing?Well, that there
was a hippopotamus. Mm-hm.And they are awfully fast.Faster than a horse,
if you can believe that.And they've got
an awful ferocious bite.How about that?
You know, the funny thing is,I don't remember...knowing much about hippos
until right now.You're a zoologist.- I'm sorry, what now?
- Are we in Florida?Just listen.
This is a dangerous place.Crazy dangerous.But Martha and I,
we've been here before.We know what we're doing. You
gotta stay alert all the time.If I'm near water, I got one eye
on the water, you hear me?You got to have eyes
in the back of your...- [SCREAMS]
- [GASPS][MUFFLED GRUNTING]Oh, God.What in the Sam Hill
just happened to him?[ELECTRONIC CHIME ECHOES][OBERON YELLING][GROANS]Shut the front door.What the hell
happened to you?Damn!A plane?What? Come on! Follow me!Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Follow us.[PLANE ENGINE ROARING][âªâªâª]Welcome to Jumanji.- Why is he in a plane?
- I don't know.Well, don't just stand there.
Hop in!NIGEL: Strap in.
There's no time to spare.Dr. Bravestone,
famed archeologistand international explorer,I'm so glad you've returned.I've been so anxious
for your arrival.- You talking to me?
- Yes.Once again, Jumanji
is in great peril,and only you can help.Nigel, we're looking
for our friend.- Have you seen, like, anyone...?
- Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men,welcome to Jumanji.- "Killer of men"?
- Yeah, I, uh... I kill guys.I'm so glad you've returned.I've been so anxious
for your arrival.- What's with this fella?
- My dearest Mouse,surely you remember me.Nigel Billingsly
at your service.Hey. Nigel,
I thought that was you.He's a... Uh, what is it called?- NPC, a non-player character.
- OBERON: He's not a real person.He only has a limited
number of things he can say.Mm, my friend Carl
is just like that.Nigel, we're looking
for someone.Has anyone arrived
in Jumanji...?Jumanji is in great peril.It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.Perhaps you should
read it aloud.Grandpa Eddie.- Do you have a letter?
- Do I have a letter?- Check your pockets.
- Why would I have a letter?Nigel here
wrote you a letter.I didn't get a letter
from this guy.But we are
in a video game, and...We're in a video game?We're gonna die.- We did die.
- Are we in hell?- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.It's detailed
in the letter I sent you,Dr. Bravestone.
You should read it aloud.I don't have a letter! How many
times I gotta tell you that?Oh, no, Eddie.
It's in your hand.Where did this come from?You got to pay attention
to what's in your hand.Perhaps you should
read it aloud.[CLEARS THROAT]"Dr. Bravestone,
it is my solemn hopethat this letter finds you,
for again..."NIGEL: <i>Jumanji is in grave danger.
We need your help at once.</i>BRAVESTONE:
<i>Whoa, what's going on here?</i>RUBY: <i>It's a cutscene.
It's how we find...</i><i>I'll explain afterwards.</i>NIGEL:
<i>You see, our worst nightmare</i><i>has come to pass,</i><i>for Jurgen the Brutal
has returned.</i><i>Indeed, that most vicious
Jumanjian conqueror is back.</i>[CROWD CHEERING]<i>And he's brought with him</i><i>his savage horde.</i><i>They descended from their
fortress atop Mount Zhatmire</i><i>and made their way south
to the Avian Province,</i><i>home of the sacred
Falcon Jewel,</i><i>worn around the neck
of the village elder.</i><i>The Falcon is
the fertility jewel of Jumanji,</i><i>and it has been guarded
by the people</i><i>of the Avian Province
for hundreds of years.</i><i>So long as the jewel
can see the sun,</i><i>the waters will flow
and the land will flourish.</i>[VILLAGERS SCREAMING]- [YELLING]
- [GROANS]Yeah![âªâªâª]NIGEL:
<i>Many brave souls died that day,</i><i>but Jurgen got
what he came for.</i><i>He stowed the jewel
in darkness,</i><i>hidden from the sun.</i>[WHISTLES][GROWLING]<i>A drought befell the land.</i><i>The crops dried out and died.</i><i>And if the jewel
is not returned soon,</i><i>it may be too late.</i><i>Which is why we called for you</i><i>and your brilliant associates.</i><i>I understand
the enormous weight</i><i>that this must carry for you,
Dr. Bravestone,</i><i>how this adventure
is like no other,</i><i>since it was Jurgen the Brutal</i><i>who killed your parents.</i>No, no, no, no!- Huh?
- He killed- Dr. Bravestone's parents?
- Indeed, he did.- When the doctor was just a boy.
- Oh, well, that's terrible.I can't say this enough:
We're in a video game.You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutaland show it to the sun.He's making his way north
across the desert now.Jurgen the Brutal.
Is that Barbara's boy?And remember, the goal
is to recover the loot.To wrest it from
the hands of the brute.And if you wish
to leave the game,you must save Jumanji
and call out its name.Excuse me. Who is Jumanji?Well, if I was listening
correctly, that is her sister.Here's your map.Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit.- Huh?
- I can't land here,so you're going
to have to drop in.- What?
- No, no. Nigel...- I'll get as low as I can.
- Hold on.- Get ready.
- What do you mean?We don't have parachutes.Shouldn't we have...? Ahh!- MOUSE: What the hell?
- NIGEL: Good luck.The future of Jumanji
is in your hands.Why did we take a plane
if there's nowhere to land?And go![SCREAMING][ALL GRUNTING][SCREAMING][GRUNTING][GROANING][âªâªâª][GASPING]The hell, man?Where are we?Where's the jungle?What are we doing here?We've got to keep it
together, okay?- "Keep it together"?
- Yes.This is
a whole new thing.Nobody said we'd have to do
a whole new thing.And by the way, what the hell
happened to Bethany?[GROANS][WIND WHISTLING]MOUSE: So, what part of New
Hampshire is this exactly?BRAVESTONE: We're not
in New Hampshire, Milo.That's right. Exactly.
Not New Hampshire.- You're starting to get it now?
- Nope.I don't have the foggiest clue
what's going on here.That guy kept calling me
Dr. Braverman,which is the name
of my orthopedist.I'm thinking I just had
another hip surgeryand now I'm coming out of it.Hey! Check this out![âªâªâª]Okay.
We have to find Spencer.To do that, I think we have
to start playing the game.I'm sure that's what he did.
We find him,finish the game,
and we go home.Ed, you okay?Would you look at me?I'm back.I haven't looked
like this since...Never.You looked like this never.What? When I was younger,
I was in great shape.I remember you
when you were younger,and... this is not
what you looked like.I think my eyes
are a different color.All of you
is a different color.It's a good look on me,
huh? Huh?Okay.
They're headed north.- Which way is north?
- I have no idea.- Well, you wanna check the map?
- Right. I'm the map guy now."Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit."Follow the flame
to the desert fruit.You know there's
nothing on that?He can see it,
you can't.Each place on the map
is a different level,and the levels
get harder as we go.This one is called..."Dunes."No shit.BRAVESTONE:
Who the hell is that?Oh, that's an ostrich.- Oh, no.
- Yes, indeed.That is an ostrich.The ostrich
is a flightless bird,one of 60 species.You got the penguin, you got
the emu, and you got the kiwi.Heh, heh, funny thing is,
I don't remember knowing...OBERON & RUBY:
You're a zoologist.I was a zoologist last time.
It's important.Maybe if we could get through
this quicker.Well, another thing is, they can
run up to 45 miles per hour,which makes them the world's
fastest two-legged animal.Did you know that?
Fascinating.- What a magnificent creature.
- We should get out of here.[SQUAWKS]What else do you know?Here's another
interesting fact.[SQUAWKS]They have three stomachs.
How about that?[SQUAWKS]Ah! Come on.
Beat it!Don't get so close.Just a bird, okay? Come on,
get moving. Get out of here.- Anything else we need to know?
- Beat it, bird.Another interesting thing
about the ostrich...I said scram,
you stupid bird!- ...is when threatened...
- Get out of here!...they attack.[ALL GASPING]MOUSE:
Oh, my![SQUAWKS]- Eddie! Eddie!
- Oh!Where's Eddie? Is he dead?- Yes.
- No. Yes, he died,but he's fine.Did I just kill Eddie...by talking too slow...like he always said
I would?[ELECTRONIC CHIME ECHOES][RUMBLING][GRUNTS]Why does everybody keep
dropping from the sky?Nurse, I'm gonna need to see
Dr. Braverman right now, please.I'm not your nurse.
Okay, listen.These tattoos on our arms,
that is your life count.We each have three lives.You and Fridge
each have two left.If you lose all three,listen to me,
it is game over.- That's it. You're dead.
- Dead like... "kaputski"?Yes.Kaputski.[RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT PLAYS]What the hell is that?- That's not good.
- Look.[RUMBLING]Oh, there's one more thing
about ostriches.Oh, no.Say it!They travel in herds.[SQUAWKING]We gotta get out of here!- Dune buggies, let's go!
- Come on, come on! Shake a leg!- BRAVESTONE: Hey, wait.
- MOUSE: Why am I so slow?OBERON:
Haul ass, girl. Let's go!- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming, Eddie.- Go.
- Do you see the key anywhere?- Okay, how do I do this?
- I've never driven one of these![SQUAWKING]Maybe under the dash.- Green button!
- Green button. Go.Go, go, go![ENGINE REVS]Go, go.[âªâªâª]Oh, my God![SCREAMS][SCREAMS, GROANS][GRUNTING]MOUSE:
Go.You are
a terrible driver.What are you talking about?
We're fine.Nobody fine. You... Oh! Oh, oh!Oh, no! Ahh, ahh!Oh, help! Oh, oh!Hold on, Eddie.
Please don't let go.Ahh! Oh! Oh, wow!Oh, help. Ahh![YELLS]Help. Eddie. Oh![GROANS, GRUNTS]Beat it!Get out of here!I think we lost them.- Yeah?
- Yeah.[BOTH SCREAM][BOTH GRUNTING][BOTH PANTING]- Are you okay?
- Yeah.[RUMBLING]Oh, no.[OSTRICHES SQUAWKING]- Ahh!
- What do we do?I don't know![âªâªâª]Get in! Hurry![ALL GROAN]Ha! Suckers!- Eddie...
- Uh-oh.- RUBY: Oh, my...
- OBERON: Whoa, whoa!- Oh, dude!
- MOUSE: Oh, dear.[PANTING]RUBY:
What do we do?What do we do?[ENGINE REVS]What are you doing?- OBERON: Birds, birds, birds!
- Birds!- What the hell, man?
- They're flightless birds.This is a flightless
dune buggy!- OBERON: Oh!
- Oh, no![ALL YELLING]OBERON:
No, no, no!- We're not going to make it.
- We're gonna make it.- RUBY: No, we're not!
- We're not gonna make it.We're gonna make it.We're not gonna make it.[ALL YELL]That was fantastic. Heh.- Oh, horrible driver.
- Whoo...[GROANS]Yeah, you see that, birds?
You don't mess with the kid.Right there![SQUAWKS][OSTRICHES SCREECHING]Did you see me?I was incredible.I mean, I saved you,
I saved you,I saved this guy from a bird
while I was driving a car.I was a machine.
I was relentless.- I was fearless.
- Yes. Exactly. Fearless.That's Bravestone.
Okay, check this out.[ELECTRONIC BEEP]Oh, goodness.What the hell?It's your strengths
and weaknesses.I... I mean your avatar,Dr. Bravestone's,
strengths and weaknesses."Fearless," check."Speed. Climbing."
"Boomerang"?"Smoldering intensity"?- It's this stupid face you make.
- Huh?[SMOLDERING]There it is.Ew! Ew! Old man.
Get it together.Eddie, you okay?
You having a heart attack?His whole left side is shutting
down. Eddie, look at me!- Yeah?
- There you go. Now you're back."Weakness: switchblade."Switchblade? Hey, that's new.Bravestone didn't
have weaknesses last time.Yeah,
bugged the hell out of me.I wonder if...[ELECTRONIC BEEP]- "Nunchucks"? That's new.
- Damn, that's a good list.Milo, push on your left,
like, chest area.- I'm sorry, what?
- Come on, man.Hey!Oh, I got one too. What...?My. "Zoology." That's what
you were talking about earlier.- Yes. Exactly.
- Yes.Your avatar is a zoologist.You know, my nephew Maxwell
is a veterinarian.- What a fascinating...
- "Linguistics"?- I didn't have that last time.
- The study of languages.Makes sense.
He studies the entire languageon his way to the point.Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?- Time does fly.
- [SIGHS]Okay, let's get it over with.[ELECTRONIC BEEP]You gotta be kidding me.Well, geometry is...- Is new.
- Yeah.Who wouldn't wanna
be better at geometry?And for weaknesses,
"Endurance."And what else? Let's see,
"Heat, sun and sand."Shouldn't be a problem.
It's not likewe're in the middle of
a goddamn desert or anything.What's the point of this guy?
Who even needs this guy?He can read the map.Easy for you to say,
you got nunchucks!I've been training four hours
a day for six months.Now look at me!Man, it is hot out here!How is this guy a character
in an adventure game?Okay, okay, okay.I gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.I know how to do that.Burpees.
Five burpees, right now.Get it going![GRUNTING]- MOUSE: That's one.
- One![GRUNTING][WHEEZING, GRUNTING]- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah, come on![GROANS]North is that way![âªâªâª]MOUSE:
You know, it's, uh...It's really good
to see you, Ed.I don't wanna hear it.You don't wanna hear
that it's good to see you?- You sold me out, Milo.
- I did not sell you out.We sold our business.
It was time.- Yeah, time for who?
- Well, it was time for me.Okay? Standing on my feet,serving a hundred plates
a night for 35 years?I was done.I was ready, man.I was ready to retire.I'm done talking![âªâªâª]OBERON:
"The Oasis."I guess

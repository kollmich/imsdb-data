Can you just listen up?Guys?We got 2,000 feet,
600 vertical metersto Camp Four.It's roped all the way,
so I know you can make it.Once we get to
the yellow band,we're gonna regroup,put on the masks,
turn on the gas.Make sense?325 dollars a bottle.For oxygen?That's daylight robbery!Yeah, well, he's
cornered the market, he's got it.He reckons there's gonna be
20 teams at Base Camp this season.Twenty teams?I mean, with all
the Sherpas and porters,it's gonna be
a squeeze up there.Well, that's a scrum on
the ropes, right there.What is this?
It's Helen's.It's a little
decoration for the mess tent.You can wear them
in your hair.I'll have that.
Thank you.Okay, I got some news.We got Krakauer.You stole him
from Scott Fischer?No, he made up
his own mind.Good job, Rob!How much is he
paying you, Rob?Well, he's only
paying for his airfarebut we get 5,000
words in the magazineand our picture on
the front cover. Huh?That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.Well, if you get
him to the top.If?If? How can you
say that to me?There you go.
You all right?Thanks, Guy.
Cheers, mate.Hey!
Hello!You all right?
Oh, yeah, how are you?Me? I'm good.
Oh, look at you!I know, I'm big.Here you go.
You good?Yeah, you know,
I'm just gonna miss you.Come on.- Let's go, Guy.
Mmm-hmm.Just go careful,
all right?It's...
Please, my love.Come on.
Please don't worry.It's just the doing
nothing back herethat's making me worry.You're not doing nothing.No, but...What?It's the waiting for you.For him.
Her.Her.
Her.Just be back for
the birth, Rob Hall.You try and stop me.<i>This is a final call</i><i>for Air New Zealand
Flight 7419 to Kathmandu.</i>Okay, I love you.
Go, or I'll cry.Go.Yeah.That all you got?Yeah, that's it.I think
we're over here.Hey, what outfit
you guys with?Uh, Adventure Consultants.Ah, good. Me too.Ah.
I'm Beck.Beck Weathers.
Doug Hansen.Jon Krakauer.
How you doing?Good.
Are you, uh...Krakauer from <i>Outside</i> magazine?
Yep.Really?What are you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?Little bit of both.
Hmm.Well, I'll let you know
how the summit goes, okay?No need.
I'll be there.Ah, we'll see.What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?What, for work?
Yeah.Uh, different things.
Carpenter, mailman.Carpenter, mailman?Yep.Seriously,
you deliver the mail?Yeah, I deliver the mail.Mailman on Everest?Hope so.I like that.Mailman on Everest.There we go.- Beck.
- Yeah?You know he made it to the
South Summit on Everest last year?Who, Doug did?
Yeah.That's pretty
high for a mailman.Yep. Longs Peak, McKinley.I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.I know.
Well, how do you know that?'89, right?Oh!You've done your research.That's what we do.You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.A history made
famous by George Everest,George Mallory,
Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary.And Rob Hall!Legends all of them!That's right.For those of you who
dare face their dreams,Adventure Consultants
offers somethingbeyond the power of
words to describe.And why don't we describe it
in the brochure?Because it's mostly
just pain.- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth?And the odd,
if you don't mind, Mike,and the odd missing toe.There we go.To put it simply,
guys, human beingssimply aren't
built to functionat the cruising
altitude of a 747.Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Colour bodies will be
literally dying.And I mean
literally dying.It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.So the game is,can we get you up to the top
and down to the bottombefore that happens?- You sure can.
- Oh!Beck Weathers,
ladies and gentlemen.You might have noticed
a bit of the Lone Star State?100% Texan
right here, people.100% Texan.You've met Mike Groom.I'd like to introduce you
to Andy Harris.- Harold.
- Our other guide out of Queenstown.Taranaki, actually,
originally. <i>Kia ora.</i>Helen and the rest of the team
are already on the way up to Base Camp.They're setting it up
for when we get there.Today's March 30, people.I plan on going for
the summit May 10.It's been a lucky day for me
and Adventure Consultantsand the weather's usually
pretty stable around then.So that means,we have 40 days to train
your bodies and your mindsto go for it.Now, I know there's a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room.You wouldn't be
here without it.Stu, K2, Broad Peak.John Taske.1,192 meters of
Mount Kosciuszko.And... I mean,
Yasuko Namba.Six of the Seven Summits
and the only woman.There you go.Let's make it seven.
Thank you.But Everest, though, is another beast,
another beast altogether.That's why you're here,
isn't that right, Dougie?Oh, yeah. Yeah.So, listen. Tonight, that's it from me.
Eat, drink, be merry.Tomorrow, we trek.We good?
You ready for this?Dougie.All right,
folks, hang on.Okay.That's it,
here we go, Colonel.All right,
everybody, earbuds.Take your seats,
buckle in, everyone.Thanks, Mike.Do or die.
Here we go.Okay.Can you believe it?<i>Bravo 270 en route,
request Bravo 410.</i>Keep 'em all
in a nice group.Hey, guys,
take it easy.- Yes, I'm ready.
- Ready.We're kicking
it off, let's go.You lead
the way, pal.You all right?Yes.Guys, man wants to
see your climbing permits.Need to see all your
climbing permits!<i>Namaste.</i>Thank you very much,
we'll see you on the way back.Thank you very much.All good?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you?Yeah.
Hey, uh...Thanks, Rob.Thanks for what?You know, the discount.Well, you're working
three jobs, Doug.It was the least
I could do, mate.I know, you didn't have to do it,
though, and I appreciate it.Let's just get you
to the top this time.Yeah.How you feeling, Beck?Fair to middling.Come on, buddy,
you can do it.Thought I was gonna
acclimatize faster than this.Uh, you'll be all right.Darn critters.Whoo!Wow.
Yeah.How close
did you get?Well, I got real close
but it got late and I waspretty shot anyways.Well, I think I would
have made a run for it.Every day I wake
up thinking that.Then why didn't you do it?'Cause I
turned him around.Morning 15 at
the South Summit,bad conditions,we weren't gonna make
our 2:00 p.m. turnaround.See, it's all good and well
to make the top, Beck,but you pay me to
bring you down safely.Remember that.Okay.What's eating him?One of our Sherpas, Tenzing.
He had an accident.Oh, yeah?
Yeah.Fell while fixing one of
the ladders on the Icefall.It's not good.
They had to bring him down.<i>Namaste.</i><i>Namaste.</i>Congratulations, you all made it.
Welcome to Base Camp!We got the United
Nations here this year.Got the IMAX team,
South Africans.And right up herein the best spot of allwe have the Adventure
Consultants Base Camp.Hey, Helen.
Hey. Hi, how are you?Good to see you.
Thank you.
Welcome, nice to see you.Hi, Rob.
Hey.Well done,
you all right?Yeah, good. You?- Yeah, no, we're good.
- It looks good.For those of you that haven't met,
this is Helen Wilton,Base Camp manager.She will be your mom
for the next few weeks.Any problems, take it to
her and she'll sort it.All right, well,
it's very niceto finally meet
you all in person.Ang Dorjee, come here.This is Ang Dorjee,
everyone.He's your climbing <i>sirdar,</i>
your lead Sherpa.Hey, how are ya?You speak English?Better than you, Mr. America.Bet you climb better than I do, huh?
Yeah.Yeah?Summited three times, Beck.All right, all right.
I hear ya, I hear ya.All right, well, there's
tea in the mess tentwhen you've
dumped your sacksand the comms
tent's down the back,that's the cooking tent,
and over thereis the toilet.It's a little bit drafty,
but just remember thatwhen the wind gets
up here, you've gotthe same view that
George Everest did.For those of you
who haven't used crampons beforethe left and rights are marked
with an "L" and an "R,"so you can't
get it wrong.All right?
So, simple.First of all, you push it into
the shoe with this.Unbelievable.If it isn't the mayor
of Base Camp!Scott Fischer,
Mr. Mountain Madness.In the flesh.You want a cup?Sit down, man.
Acclimatize!Okay. I'm normally
a tea man myself,but let's give it a go.Thank you so much.Wow. It's crazy
this year, eh?I know, man.Some idiot Kiwi goes and invents
Himalayan guidingand look what happens.Yeah, it didn't take you
too long to get in on the act.Gotta make a living, man.You went ahead and fixed the icefalls,
I see.Yeah, yeah.It's pretty messy up there this year.
Yeah?Crevasses are pretty big.Strung four or five
ladders across.You used good
ropes though, didn't you?You ready? Okay.This is, um, April 7th,
about 10:30 a.m.,this is Sandy Hill Pittman,reporting for NBC
Interactive Mediaand we are officially
at Everest Base Camp!She one of yours?
Oh, yeah.Someone went and
stole my journalistso I had to get another one.
Hmm.She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer,that's for sure.
Listen, just to be clear,I didn't steal
your journalist.Hey, man, it's all good.<i>Outside</i> magazine
gave me a call.Hey. Hey!
They gave me a call.- Said they wanted to...
- It's all good, man.They were gonna send
a journalist up the hilland asked me if
I was interested.It was his call
in the end.All right, Caroline MacKenzie,
team doctor.Why don't you
kick it off, Caro.- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Caro.Hi there.Sorry.
That's fine.Um...So Rob and Harold
and Mike will tell youall sorts of stuff
about mountaineering,but from a
medical standpointgetting you to the top of Everest
is really about oxygen.And the lack of it.To give you the best
chance of summitingyou need to
prepare your bodiesfor the thin air up there.So, over the next month,
before the final ascentyou're gonna make three
partial acclimatizing ascentsreturning here to
Base Camp after each one.<i>The bad news is
that each ascent</i><i>begins and ends
with the Icefall.</i><i>I'm sorry, but there
is no way around it.</i><i>There are millions
of tons of glacial ice</i><i>continually moving
day and night.</i><i>You got seracs
the size of tower blocks,</i>you got crevasses so deep
they probably don't even have a bottom.It is not a place that
you wanna get caught hanging out in,especially when
the sun hits it.So we're gonna be
up nice and earlyand through that
as soon as possible.Now the Sherpas
have gone ahead<i>and fixed the ladders
across the crevasses</i><i>and we've made it as
safe as we possibly can.</i><i>But that is not to say
that it is completely safe.</i><i>19 people have
died in that Icefall.</i>Whoa!
Whoa! Hold on!Steady.You all right, Jon?You all right?- I'm good.
- Okay.All right, steady up.
Whoo!<i>So remember,
we're a team.</i><i>Let's look out for each other.</i><i>Look out
for hypothermia,</i><i>things like slurred speech
and irrational behavior.</i><i>I've seen hypoxic
climbers rip off</i><i>all their clothes
at 8,000 meters</i><i>because they're feeling hot.</i>You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brainto the point of loss of motor
function and eventually death.<i>And pulmonary edema,
which is your lungs filling with fluid</i><i>so you effectively drown.</i><i>The only cure is to get
down the mountain, fast.</i>- All right, okay.
- All right, buddy.<i>But it is not all
doom and gloom here, okay?</i><i>Myself and
the whole AC team are here</i><i>to make sure you get
up and down safely</i><i>and you will
acclimatize naturally.</i>So why don't we all
give Caro a nice big thank you,it's her
first time here.- All right.
- Nice job.Well done.See, you want to
get on the regulator.You want to
hear that hiss.Connect your hose.- Yasuko.
- Beck.How'd you do, darling?
Okay.- Good?
- Well done.Can I get a hit of that?Have a suck on that.In a situation like this,
you just wannacatch your breath,
throw it up to four.You should start
feeling pretty good.I can feel it already.How did you boys go?Hey.
Instant happiness.- It's amazing.
- Very happy.Doug, you okay?Well, when we get
back to Base,I want you to get Caro
to take a look at you.- No. I'm all right, I'm okay.
- No, no.And do me a favor,
spend your night on oxygen.Yeah?
Yeah.We got enough?We got plenty.
All right.Get some tea into ya.Just lift your
shirt up a bit.Thank you.And take a deep
breath for me?Just take one of those
in the morningwith a bit of water,
before breakfast.Okay, thanks.Right, Beck, you're up.
Sorry. Here, go for it.Read it and weep.Take it
easy, Doug.Right, you can stop.
Yeah?You're in
great shape, Beck.I am in great shape.- You are.
- Six days a week in the gym.Ought to do it.
Your wife must love that.Yeah, she does.Oh, no. What's
the date today?April 25th.No!I need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?You might wanna
look at this one first.It came in for you
last night.- Lord.
- What?Can I use your sat phone?
Ooh!Well, if this did come in last night,
it's an emergency.It's 25 bucks
a minute, Beck.Yep, fine.No, this one's on us.Seriously?Thanks.Rob!- Beck?
<i>- Peach, it's me.</i>What's happened?<i>Nothing, nothing.
I'm fine.</i>Where are you?<i>Uh, I'm at Base Camp
right now.</i>You're calling
me from Everest?Yeah, it's
a satellite phone, honey.<i>Oh, my God, how much is that costing?
What's the problem?</i>There is no problem, Peach.Uh...I'm sorry,
we were up at Camp Twoand that's why I didn't
send you a fax yesterday.Happy anniversary! Okay?<i>How are the kids?</i>Fine.<i>Peach?</i>Bub's heredoing his homework
in the morning, as per usual.You wanna say
hi to him?<i>Well, yeah, of course I do.</i>Hang on.
<i>Okay.</i>Say hi.
Hey, Dad!<i>- Hey, bud!</i>
- Hi!<i>I miss you, buddy.</i>Oh! And Meg went
on her first date last weekend.Well, you did!<i>Wow! Really?</i>
Mmm-hmm.Get off!
<i>Peach?</i>I miss you, honey.Mom? Mom?<i>I miss the kids.</i>A lot.<i>Peach?</i>Listen, I gotta get
the kids to schoolso I gotta run.Okay.<i>Yeah, go careful.</i><i>Bye-bye.</i>Is Dad okay?Just, he never calls.I think he's scared.Here, come in, mate,
come on!- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.You don't dance,
you don't climb!Come on, guys,
Beck Weathers!No dance, no climb!
No dance, no climb!Hey, man.
Breaking into the rations?Yeah, you want some?No. I'll wait
till we summit.I don't know
about that, Neal.We'll get there.I'm excited.Anyway, me
and Anatoliare here to help you,
you know?There's too much
competition, Toli.We don't need competition
between people.There is competition between
every person and this mountain.The last word always belongs
to the mountain.- Ang Dorjee!
- Yeah?Stay there, Beck,
stay there.Okay,
I'm coming down!Harold, Mike,
this is Rob.<i>Mike here.</i>
This isn't happening, guys.Let's turn 'em around,let's get 'em off the face and back down
to Base Camp. Turn around.- Ang Dorjee, come on, we're going down.
- Okay.My hand.Okay, make
a fist again.Keep clenching,
just keep the blood flowing.What's going on, man?We're still waiting
for the South Africans.Taiwanese took forever as well.Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.Yeah, yeah. Your Yak
Fund money's coming.You serious, man?Come on, get a move on.How long you been
waiting here?Good 45 minutes.Man, it's freezing.- Yeah.
- It's stinging, huh?Yeah. Right at the tips.Hey, Rob, we gotta
get 'em over.We're working on it.He's
freezing, mate.- Are you set?
- Clear.- Sending him over, Mike!
- Yeah, all right.Looking good, Beck.Looking good.That's it. No, head up,
mate, head up.Steady yourself!Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!Little help?
Help! Help!Mike, you good?Are these ladders
gonna take two?Yeah, I'll get a rope,
I'll belay you.Just stay right
where you are, mate.I can't pull myself up!I'm gonna come out to you.Okay.You're good,
Beck, you're okay.Got it for you.Right, tie me
in, Scott, tie me in.Come and get me!- On belay?
- Got it. On belay.Let's go.Right, I'm coming out to you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.Nice and easy,
you're tied in, mate.I can't
feel my hands.You're looking good.Grab me.
Beck, Beck, Beck.Grab me!
Stay right where you are, mate.I'm right here,
I'm coming to you.I can't pull myself up!I got ya.You okay?There's no guarantee
to the summit, I get it.But to get killed
because I'm waiting in linelike I'm in
freaking Walmart.That's not why I
paid you 65,000 dollars.Now get me off of here.That's it.
Plant your feet one at a time.All right,
thanks for coming by.Uh...Look, Base Camp's,
you know, chockablock full this year, so,I think it would
all benefit us greatlyby coming together
like thisand, you know, working out
some kind of plan and schedule.What, like some
kind of rota?Yes.On Everest?Everyone knows
Everest is a businessfor you, Robert,
are you kidding?What gives you
the right to tell uswhen we can climb
and when we can't?I'm not telling you, mate.
I'm asking.If we know when everybody's
planning to summit, for instance,you know, we can
avoid the chaosthat happened in
the Icefall today.Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10.So are we, man!
Us too.May 10.Okay, that's bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the Hillary Step.Yes, it is,
that's my point.Look, this is ridiculous.
We're summiting when we want.All right?And I don't need
your permission to climb the mountain.Ian, have you seen
how many people are here at Base Camp?We're finished here.
Come on, guys.
Ian! Hey, man.Oh, Rob!- Ah! Come in, man!
- Hi.Have a drink, Rob!
Come on, man.<i>Na zdorovie.</i><i>Na zdorovie!</i>Can we have a word?
Yeah.You feeling
a little crook, huh?No, it's just a little...Little touch of
the Delhi belly.He means
Buddha belly.Maybe Sandy's caviar.I told you not to have
the Dom Perignon with it!What's going on,
Roberto?I don't like the look
of the crowds on the ropes.I think we're gonna
have some troubleonce we get
above Camp Three.I mean, you wanna top
it on the 10th, yeah?Yeah.
So do I.What, are you saying
we should team up?Well, it's an idea, yeah.Oh, man.I don't know, man.
We have different styles, man.All due respect, you're a hand-holder.
I mean, the best, but...I just believe that if you can't
get up there yourselfyou shouldn't be on
the mountain at all.You guide your team,
I guide mine.I'm just suggesting
that we workwith each other
instead of against.The only way we both summit, mate,
is if we work together.Particularly fixing the ropes.It's gotta make sense.Whoo-ie! Why not?Yeah?
Yeah, I see the sense in it.Good man.
That was all.All right.Who's gonna lead
when we get up there?Rob. If I say I will
do it, it will be done.Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!You gotta work
with Ang Dorjee,because we're
working together now.I'm just saying,
if both of us...Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!Okay?Ang Dorjee.We're all professionals here.We'll work together and
we'll get the job done. Yes?All right.
Yeah.We're planning on stashing,
what, eight bottles of Oup at the South Summit.- Well, I'm not using O.
- What do you mean?You're not
using oxygen at all?Come on, man.
You know you want to.English air.
Don't need it.Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.You have people's lives in your hands.
It's a job.Never used it.
Never will.Bigger problems
if you run out.Okay.I'll put some more
bottles of O up there.All right, that'll be good.
All right.Just so long as
you guys are clear.If you work for me,
you use oxygen,otherwise you
don't work for me.You don't have to
ask, mate.I've been up there
before without O's, Rob.I don't need to
do it with clients.All right, next
we have to fix ropes.Yeah.
Particularly above the Lhotse Face.Hillary Step need
new fixed rope.And South-East Ridge
as well.Yes, it does.
Well...My idea is that
we work togetherand we fix
ropes together.We share the duties.- Okay?
- Sounds good.All right,
you and Lopsang maybe get together.Talk about who wants
to fix what and where, okay?Only essentials. I'm not
gonna tell you what to pack,but be brutal. Okay?One pound down here
is like 10 up there.Light and fast.What, and just like that,
you kill my summit cappuccino.Go. go, go! Run!- That camera's totally dying.
- Okay.All right, it's gonna
be a tough week.But it is gonna be
the best Friday of your lives.Yeah, what are we
doing again on Friday?Summiting!- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yes, it is, yes, it is.I'll take three.It's from Jan.I knew it was gonna be a girl.
I can't believe it.It's a girl!All right,
good on you!I knew I was.I knew she was.
Congratulations.Thank you, thank you, Doug.
Cheers, mate.When's she due?Mid-July, as soon
as I get back.You better
sleep now, buddy.Yeah, that's true.Hey, Rob.Yeah?
So...Jan doesn't mind
you being here?Uh-oh.Krakauer's sword
is unleashed.It's okay. Jan's a climber, Jon,
she gets it.- Yeah!
- Cheers, Helen.What about you, Doug?
What about your wife?Oh, she's been fine with it,
ever since we divorced.She's been great
with everything since then.I'm so sorry, buddy.No, no.No, no, no, I ask
because Peach said to me,"if you climb one more mountain,
I will divorce you."And you went ahead
and then booked this trip!No, no, no,
the worst part of itis that I kind of
forgot to tell her.You don't forget to tell her
you're climbing Everest!I forgot to
tell her, I did.All right. It's all
on the table, here.It hurts, it's dangerous,
it destroys relationships,it's costing you
all a small fortune.Are there any
negative aspects to this game?I gotta ask the question,
you know I do.Why?Why.Because...It's there!That's why.
Thank you, Mr. Mallory.- Come on.
- Guys, I'm serious.Yasuko. Why are you
climbing Everest?Uh...I'm 47 years old,I have reached six of
the seven summits, so...Of course, now I have
to reach the seventh.That's not an answer.No. Why any summit?Doug.Me?
Why?Come on,
tell 'em about the kids.What?Tell 'em about the kids.Whose kids?
Oh...You have kids?Yeah, I have kids,
but, I thought I told you,there's an elementary school,
back home.And I've been going
and talking to the kids thereand they actually helped me raise
some of the money to comeand gave me a flag
to plant on the summit, and...So, I was thinking,
maybe it's...They see a
regular guy can,you know, follow
impossible dreams,maybe they'll be inspiredto do the same, I guess.I'm climbing Mount Everestbecause I can.Because to be able
to climb that highand see that kind of beauty
that nobody ever sees,it'd be a crime not to.Hear, hear, Dougie.- There you go.
- I like that.Hello?<i>Hey. Did I wake you?</i>No.<i>I did too, you liar.</i><i>Huh?</i><i>You okay?</i>
Yeah.Yeah, yeah,
I'm good, I'm better.I'm better now, I'm...<i>I miss you.</i><i>We go for
the final ascent tomorrow.</i>So, you summit Friday?<i>Yeah, the 10th.</i><i>It's your lucky day.</i>It is.<i>How's the weather?</i>It's good.Yeah, I think we're
gonna get a good window.<i>So, it's a girl.</i>Yeah.And did you go to the doctor,
did you get a scan done?Did you see her?<i>Yeah, sure did.</i>And? Come on.
What did she look like?Oh, you know.
Blonde hair, nice smile,perfect
height-to-weight ratio,she's gonna be a great climber.<i>She's there, Rob.</i><i>Already.</i>
Wow.<i>A little me, a little you.</i>A little bear, huh?<i>And then, one day, you</i>and meand our little Sarah,we'll all go climbing
together. Hmm?Sarah?<i>Yeah, what do you think?</i>No way!
<i>Come on.</i>No!<i>Please? Think about it.</i>No.
<i>Huh?</i><i>You still there?</i>Of course I'm still here.I love you.<i>Love you, too.</i><i>Sleep well, my love.</i>All right. Bye.Take it easy, now.
You're gonna be okay.We're gonna get you
down the hill. All right?Hey, Neal, you okay?Yeah, Dale, he doesn't
look too good.We need to
take him down.Yeah.You can't get
Scott on the radio?Nope. Nah, I think
he's up ahead.Best not to stare
too long at the summit.That's a long way
to go, man.Head down,
one step at a time.You got it, boss.You seen Dale?Yeah, I did, he wasn't
looking too goodbut Neal seemed to have
a handle on the situation.Tried to get you
on the radio.You're kidding me.
No.This thing's
not working, huh?I'm going down to Camp One.If he's not doing so well,
I'm gonna take him down to Base Campand I'll head back up.
You guys all right?Yeah.He can't be too far
ahead of you, mate.Yeah, I'll make it
down in half the time.I'm gonna
catch you! Whoo!Rob to Guy.<i>Rob to Guy,
you up there, mate?</i>Yeah, Guy to Rob.
I'm here.<i>Good to
hear you, Gee.</i><i>Where are you?</i>Camp One, Pumori.Yeah.There you go, I got
the old sly rotter.Listen, I think you're on
the wrong mountain, there.Look, I can't talk,
we gotta get out of here.<i>All right, mate.</i><i>Well, listen,
you take care on the kiddie slope.</i><i>I'm gonna get back
to the real thing.</i><i>Yeah, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.</i>Ice!Rob!I got you!Harold, you okay?Is everyone okay?We're okay!Come here, sit down, sit.I'm fine.Look at me.Look at me.
I'm fine, mate.Look at me, Harold!Look, I'm telling you,
I'm all right.Okay.
I'm all right.There you go.
Thank you.Don't do that
to me again, eh?I'm sorry.Okay, mate.I'm gonna drop
back with Frank,he's struggling a bit,
all right?All right.Straight down.Let's get him
on the oxygen.Rob Hall to Scott Fischer,
Rob Hall to Scott Fischer,Mountain Madness,
how do you copy?Hey, man! Scott, here.I've been down to Base Camp,
and I'm back at Camp One.I'm gonna catch you tomorrow.What, you're not gonna
rest up a day first? No?<i>Scott, you sound
a little rough.</i><i>Mate, take an extra day.</i>No way, JosÃ©, what,
miss out on all the fun?That's a lot of up and down in one day,
even for you, Scott.You know what
they say, man.It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.<i>Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?</i><i>Scott?</i>
I'll be good.Just taking a shot
of dexamethasone now.<i>Well, just don't push yourself
too hard, okay? Over and out.</i>Rob, I've just been over
to Mal's to get a weather update.It's moving fast.It's changed
course slightly.<i>And it could still go north,
but, if it doesn't</i><i>it's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.</i>It's a weather
forecast, Helen.This mountain makes
its own weather.We're keeping an eye on it.<i>Yeah, sure, just
letting you know.</i>Appreciate it, Helen.Why do we do
this to ourselves?Oh, this is crazy.You know, I never
told Krakauer thiswhen he was asking us
why we climb Everest.When I'm at homeI just got this big,black cloud following me.You know,
like a depression?And when I'm out hereon a mountain,
any mountain...Yeah?It's just like it's a cure.I feel like I'm reborn.So, you're happy now?No, I'm starting
to wonder.This is suffering, man.Yeah.
This is suffering.Yeah.Suffer a few more days,for the rest of your
life you'll be a guythat got to the top
of Everest.Mmm.
Huh?I just hope I get there.Yeah.Just hope I get there,
and get home.What do you
think, Mike?Looks pretty good.Little bit of wind,
up higher.I mean, if it picks up,
we can always come back down.Exactly.
It's your call, Rob.Let's get 'em all going.Rob!You okay?Not good!Ah.I'm hoping it's gonna
die down after sundown.It's been doing that.I don't like this.Well, we don't go
if it doesn't calm.I talk to Scott
when he comes here.Okay.Scott! Scott!Toli?
Here!Toli!Where's Rob?
Where are they?We go down!
No.What's Rob's...
What's Rob's team doing?He wants to see
if this passes.If he waits,we wait.Okay.Hey, guys.Come out and take a look.At least somebody
up there loves us.Nothing?Where'd the storm go?Exactly.That's crazy.You ready to saddle up?Okay, everyone.
We got a window.We don't know
how long it's gonna last,but we're gonna
go for it.Be ready in
half an hour.We'll have
a 2:00 p.m. turnaround,let's climb this thing.Okay.So, today's
the day, huh?Yep.Now or never.Oh, boy.Now the South Africans
were late out of Camp Three.They never made
it into Camp Four.Probably got caught up in it.<i>Maybe it blew through early.</i>Yeah, well,
it hit us all night,but now there's nothing.
Absolutely nothing.So, it's definitely
worth a shot.<i>I'll radio out and
tell everyone the news.</i><i>Any messages?</i>Yeah, ring Jan
and tell her that we're heading out.I'll call you,
Helen, in 12 hourswhen we get
to the summit.Turnaround's 2:00 p.m.<i>Good luck,
and Godspeed to you all.</i>Okay, thanks,
Helen. Bye-bye.I'll see you
guys up there.- Take it easy, Scott.

rest, okay?See you there.You got the ropes
for the Hillary Step?Yeah.Okay.
Okay.Okay. Yeah.Can we go
any faster?Not a chance we can go faster here.
It's too difficult.This could take a while.We're losing time.Beck. What's wrong?I don't know.I had an operation a couple years ago,
on my eyes.That might be it.- I don't know.
- Okay.You guys go
in front of us.All right, Beck,
let's sit you down.Beck. Look at me.I need to send you
down with someone.No, I don't wanna
go down, Rob.No, you gotta go down.
I don't wanna go down.Okay.Right, Beck, listen.You can wait here for half an hour.
Beck, listen to me.If it gets
better by thenjoin in the queue
and keep going up.But if it doesn't get better, Beck,
I'm sorry, mate, it's over.Okay.The Sherpas are

Hang on.You can
do this, Dougie.I know you can, pal.Yeah.I don't wanna see you back here
a third time, mate.Huh?John. You headed
back down?There's a holdup.There's no fixed ropes
above the South Summit.Yeah, I know, mate,but we're sorting
that situation out now.Ran out of juice,
waiting. Cold.I'm sorry, Rob.It's your call, pal.I don't wanna run
out of oxygen up there.Sorry, Rob.<i>Yeah, bit of a setback.</i><i>Lou, Stuart, and John Taske

so far?<i>Cold and windy.</i>Okay, let me know, Rob.<i>Okay, Helen,
thanks, bye-bye.</i>I hope we're not looking at
another yearwith no clients

up with your journal?Yes, ma'am.Great.Did you bring it
with you?Arthur.Last time,
I asked you to bring your journalwith you
for these appointments.Can I see it?I've been using it as a journal,but also
as a joke diary.Funny thoughts
or observations.I think
I told youI'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.No, you didn't.I think I did."I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."[laughs]How does it feel to
have to come here?Does it help to have
someone to talk to?I think
I felt betterwhen I was locked
up in the hospital.And have you
thought more aboutwhy you were
locked up?[head thudding]Who knows?I was wondering if you
could ask the doctorto increase
my medication.Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.Surely,
they must be doing something.I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.[gasps][laughing]Would you please
stop bothering my kid?I wasn't bothering him.
I was...Just stop.[Arthur laughing]What?

- My name's Arthur.Oh, okay. Well,
there's something special about you,Arthur, I could tell.Where are you from?I live right here
in the city- with my [stammers] mother.
- [audience laughing][Murray] Okay, hold on. Hold on.There's nothing funny
about that.I lived with my mother before I made it.
Just me and her.I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,and he never
came back.[audience] Aww.[Arthur] I know
what that's like, Murray.I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.I take good care
of my mother.All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.She does.She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.[audience] Aww.Wow.I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.Come on.
For that, you gotta come down.- [audience cheering]
- Come on! Come on.[upbeat jazz music playing]Come on.[audience cheering loudly]Okay, we got a big show tonight.
Stay tuned.We'll be right back.That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.It made my day.Thanks, Murray.You see all this,
the lights, the show,the audience,
all that stuff?I'd give it all up
in a heartbeatto have a kid
like you.[stretching shoe]- [indistinct chattering]
- [music playing on radio][sighs]- [Randall] What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?Another day
in chuckle town.[man] Yup.You okay?I heard about
the beatdown you took.Fucking savages.It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.No.They'll take everything
from you if you do that.All the crazy shit
out there.- They're animals.
- [chuckles]You know what?Here.What is it?Take it.It's for you.[chuckling][Randall] You gotta
protect yourself out there.Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.Randall,I'm not supposed to
have a gun.Don't sweat it, Art.No one
has to know.And you can pay me
back some other time.You know
you're my boy.[laughing][Gary] Arthur,Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.Hey, Gary.
You know what I've always wondered?No idea.Do you people call it
miniature golfor is it just golf
to you?[Randall and Arthur
laughing][man] Punch him in the
dick, Gary.[laughing]Hello, Hoyt.Gary said you wanted to see me.How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?Not quite.Just been working
on my material.No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.Look,
I like you, Arthur.You know,
a lot of the guys,they think you're a freak,
but I like you.I don't even know
why I like you.But I got
another complaint.It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.The guy said
you disappeared.Never even
returned his sign.Because I got jumped.Didn't you hear?For a sign?That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.Just get him
his sign back.He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.Why would
I keep his sign?How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?If you don't
return the sign,I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.Are we clear?Listen,
I'm trying to help you.Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.The other guys,they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,because people
think you're weird.Okay? And I can't
have that around me.[Hoyt continues indistinctly][grunting][elevator bell dings][jabbing buttons][Sophie] Wait,
wait, wait.Wait.Thank you.[GiGi giggles]This building is so
awful, isn't it?This building is so
awful, right, Mommy?Yes, we can
hear you, GiGi.It's so awful,
Mommy.[imitates gunshot]Right, Mommy?[elevator bell dings]- Good night.
- [GiGi] This building's- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.- [baby crying]
- [man shouting]Hey.[imitates gunshot]Come on.[upbeat music playing][door closes]- [Arthur] Look up.
- [Penny] Mmm.Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?What do you think
he's gonna do?He's gonna help us.But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?Why would
he help us?Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.If he knew
how we were living,if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.I can't explain it to
you any better than that.I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.Or me.Everybody's telling methat my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?- What do you mean?
- I mean...Don't you have to be
funny to be a comedian?[men on TV singing][Arthur imitates gunshot]Hey, what's your name?Arthur.Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.I know.You know who's not?

to graduate.[audience laughing]- Yes.
- [audience whooping]So, I'll tell you
how I operate.I'm a professor ata prestigious
New England university...[Arthur laughing]...and my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."[audience laughing]I know. I know.Why is she a senior in the intro?
I didn't buy it either.So, she comes to me
during my office hours.[Arthur laughing]It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis."I can't use my real last
name at this college'cause they
don't hire Jews.[audience laughing]It's something I'll addressonce I have tenure,
but for now...She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis,I think I might be
in danger of failingyour 'Intro to Western Civ, 'and I just want
you to knowI'm willing to do
anything to pass."And I said,
"Anything?" And she said... [moans][Arthur chuckles][doorbell buzzing]- [Arthur] Oh, hey.
- Hey.Were you following
me today?Yeah.I thought
that was you.I was hoping you'd come
in and rob the place.I have a gun.I could come

front of every newspaper.Big man,
what's the good word?[Gary] Hey.["My Name Is Carnival"
playing on radio]Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.Sorry, mate.[Randall] Yeah.It doesn't seem fair,getting fired like that.Did you really
bring a gunto the children's
hospital, Artie?What the fuck would
you do that for?Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,you're just gonna
shoot yourself?[men laughing]Why don't you ask
Randall about it?It was his gun.- [Randall] What?

tries to make sense</i><i>of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,</i><i>we're joined
by Thomas Wayne.</i>Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.Yes, Mother.[Thomas] <i>Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.</i>[Penny] They're asking him aboutthose horrible
subway murders.[Chuck] <i>Thank you, Thomas.
I know</i><i>this is a difficult time
for you.</i>Why him?Looks like
he's gained weight.[Thomas] <i>Yes,
all three worked for Wayne Investments.</i><i>Good, decent, educated.</i><i>Although I didn't know
any of them personally.</i><i>Like all Wayne employees,</i><i>past and present,
they're family.</i>Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.- [shushing]
- [Chuck] <i>There now seems to be</i><i>a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.</i><i>It's almost as if our
less fortunate residents</i><i>are taking the side
of the killer.</i>[Thomas] <i>Yes,
and it's a shame.</i><i>It's one
of the reasons why</i><i>I'm considering
a run for mayor.</i><i>Gotham's lost its way.</i><i>What about
the eyewitness report</i><i>of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?</i>[Thomas] <i>Well,
it makes total sense to me.</i><i>What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?</i><i>Someone who hides
behind a mask.</i><i>Someone who is envious</i><i>of those more fortunate
than themselves,</i><i>yet they're too scared
to show their own face.</i><i>And until those kind of
people change for the better,</i><i>those of us who have made
something of our lives</i><i>will always look
at those who haven't</i><i>as nothing but clowns.</i>[laughs]<i>Thomas Wayne,
thank you for coming in this morning.</i>It's not funny.[laughs]I heard this song on
the radio the other day,and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.[social worker] Arthur...Which is crazy,because that's
my clown name at work.And until
a little while ago,it was like
nobody ever saw me.Even I didn't know
if I really existed.Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.You don't listen,
do you?I don't think you
ever really hear me.You just ask the same
questions every week."How's your job?
Are you having any negative thoughts?"All I have are
negative thoughts,but you don't
listen anyway.I said,
for my whole life,I didn't know
if I even really existed.But I do.And people are
starting to notice.They've cut our funding.We're closing down
our offices next week.The city has cut funding
across the board.Social Services is
part of that.This is the last time
we'll be meeting.Okay.They don't give a shit about
people like you, Arthur.And they really
don't give a shitabout people
like me, either.Fuck.How am I supposed to
get my medication now?Who do I talk to?I'm sorry, Arthur.<i>I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.</i><i>You know, like,
"Can I see myself in this long-term?"</i><i>"Is it safe?"</i><i>"Is it reliable?"</i>- <i>"Could it kill me?"</i>
- [audience laughing]<i>Most guys,
we look at sex like parking a car.</i><i>We're like,
"There's a spot."</i><i>"There's another spot.</i>- <i>That would work."</i>
- [Arthur exhales deeply]<i>"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."</i>[audience laughing]<i>"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."</i>[audience laughing]<i>All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.</i>[audience applauding][emcee] One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.All right, now,
this next comic describeshimself as
a lifelong Gotham residentwho from a young age
was always toldthat his purpose in lifewas to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.- Um... Okay.

Fleck, y'all.Arthur Fleck.[audience applauding][sighs nervously][laughing][snorts]Hello, it's good to be here.
[laughing][clears throat][coughing][laughing][gagging]I hated school
when I was a kid.- [microphone feedback]
- [laughing][gagging][burps][breathing heavily]I hated school as a kid.
[laughing]My mother
would say,[imitates Penny]
"You should enjoy it.One day,
you'll have to work for a living."[normal voice]
"No, I won't, Ma,I'm gonna
be a comedian."[laughing]Um...Here's one.You know,
I was just thinking the other day,- why are the rich people...
- ["Smile" playing][audience laughing][audience applauding][indistinct chattering]You believe that shit?Fuck 'em.I think the guy that
did it is a hero.Three less pricks

more to go.["Smile" continues playing][laughing][TV playing][Murray on TV] <i>And,

It's important.[Arthur whistles][Penny chuckles][Arthur humming]You smell like cologne.It's 'cause I just

man, Happy.He's a very
powerful man.We were in love.He said it was best
that we not be togetherbecause of appearances.And I could never
tell anyone because...Well, I signed
some papers.And besides,
you can imaginewhat people would say
about Thomas and me.What they'd say
about you.What would
they say, Mom?[Penny crying][train horn blowing][humming][Arthur continues humming][Arthur] Hmm.[Arthur exhales deeply]Hmm.[Arthur laughing][whistles][Arthur singing]Hi.What's your name?I'm Bruce.Bruce.I'm Arthur.That's better.[Alfred] Bruce! Bruce!Get away
from that man.It's okay.
I'm a good guy.What are you doing?
Who are you?I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne.Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.Why did you give him
these flowers?[Arthur] No,
they're not real.It's magic.I was just trying to
make him smile.Well, it's not funny,
is it?Do I need
to call the police?[Arthur] No. Please.My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.She used to work here years ago.Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?You are her son.[Arthur] Yeah.Did you know her?[whispers] I know
about the two of them.She told me everything.[whispers] There's
nothing to know.There is no "them."Your mother
was delusional.She was
a sick woman.Don't say that.Just go.Mmm?Before you make a
fool of yourself.Thomas Wayne
is my father.[Alfred laughing][Alfred yelping]He left me.[Alfred choking]- Let go! Let go!
- [Arthur grunts][Alfred continues choking][panting]Keep the respirations
above 15.Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.Mom?What happened?- Who are you?
- I'm her son.- What happened?
- You can probably help usout inside.
We don't know what happened yet.- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- [paramedic 2] Step.[paramedic 1] One more.
We got one more lift.[paramedic 2] I'm gettinga little resistance here,
Michael.[paramedics chattering
indistinctly][paramedic 1] Lift.[Arthur] I'm right here.Excuse me, sir.Does your mother take
any medications?- No.
- Excuse me,- I couldn't hear you.
- No.Sir, when was the last
time you spoke to her?I don't know.[siren wailing][Garrity] Mr. Fleck.Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.This is my partner,
Detective Burke.We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,so we spoke
with your mother.Oh.What did you
say to her?Did you do this?What? No.No, no, no.
We just asked her some questions,and she got hysterical.Hyperventilating,collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.We're sorry to
hear about that.But, like I said,
I still have some questions for you.They're about
the subway killingsthat happened
last week.You've heard about them, right?Yeah.It's horrible.Right.So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.He said you were fired
for bringing a guninto the children's hospital.- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.It's part
of my act.I'm a party clown.All right.
So, why were you fired?[sighs heavily]They said
I wasn't funny enough.Can you imagine that?If you don't mind,
I have to go take care of my mother.[Burke] Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.This condition of yours,
the laughing,is it real,or some sort
of clown thing?- A clown thing?
- Yeah.I mean, is it part of your act?What do you think?[Burke] It's exit only.She's gonna be okay.I'm gonna
get a coffee.You want one?Yeah.[audience laughing on TV][Murray] <i>So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,</i><i>you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.</i><i>I told him,
"The garbage strike</i><i>is still going on, Billy."</i><i>And he says, and I'm not
kidding, Billy says,</i><i>"So, where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?"</i>- [laughs]
- [audience laughing][audience applauding]<i>And finally,
in a world where everyone</i><i>thinks they could
do my job,</i><i>we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,</i><i>right here in Gotham.</i><i>Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,</i><i>it'll somehow
make you funny.</i><i>Check out
this joker.</i>[laughing]Oh, my God.[Arthur on TV] <i>I
hated school as a kid.</i><i>But my mother
would always say,</i>[imitates Penny]
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i><i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i>[normal voice]
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i><i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>- [laughing]

listened to your mother.</i>[audience laughing

One more, Bobby.</i><i>All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.</i>[Arthur] <i>It's funny,</i><i>when I was
a little boy</i><i>and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,</i><i>everyone laughed at me.</i><i>Well, no one's
laughing now.</i>[audience laughing]<i>You can say
that again, pal.</i>[audience applauding]<i>All right,
we got a great show for you tonight.</i><i>Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,</i><i>and new music from

mount around the metro area,</i><i>Mayor Stokes has pleaded

the point of all this?</i>[bleep] <i>the rich.</i>
[bleep] <i>Thomas Wayne.</i><i>That's what this whole</i> [bleep]

who recently announced</i><i>he is running for mayor,</i><i>will be attending
the benefit.</i><i>You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne</i><i>who first referred to</i><i>many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."</i><i>Today, he offered little
in the way of an apology.</i><i>Well, what
I will say is,</i><i>there's something wrong
with those people.</i><i>I am here
to help them.</i><i>I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,</i><i>help make
their lives better.</i><i>That is why
I'm running.</i><i>And they may not realize

to my house yesterday.- Yes.
- [Thomas laughs]I'm sorry
I just showed up.But my mother
told me everything,and I had
to talk to you.Look, pal,
I'm not your father.[chuckling]
What's wrong with you?Look at us.I think you are.Well, that's impossiblebecause you're adopted,and I never slept with
your mother.- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?- Money?
- No, I don't...I wasn't adopted.Jesus.
She never told you?Told me what?[sighs]Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.That's not true.Why are you
saying that?Then she was arrested
and committedto Arkham State Hospital,when you were
just a little boy.Why are you
saying this?I don't need you to
tell me lies.I know
it seems strange.I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.I don't know why
everyone is so rude.I don't know
why you are.I don't want
anything from you.Maybe a little bit of
warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!How about just a little
bit of fucking decency?What is it
with you people?You say that stuff
about my mother.She's crazy.She's... [laughing]You think
this is funny?Dad, it's me.

some are just crazy.Pose dangers to
themselves and others.Some just got
nowhere else to go.Don't know what to do, you know?- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.What's that?I fucked up and
did some bad shit.[chuckles]You know
what I'm talking about,it's so hard to just try
and be happy all the time.Hey, listen, man.I'm just
an administrative assistant.Like a clerk,

a lot better now.Oh, okay.
Good for you.So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,but the cops have been
coming around the shop,talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.[Arthur laughing]Anyway, um,Hoyt said that
they talked to you,and now
they're looking for me,and I just wanna know

are you part of the protest?No.No, I don't believe
in any of that.I don't believe

be good for my act.For your act?
Didn't you hearwhat happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.No, I hadn't heard.- Yeah.
- You see? This iswhat I'm telling you.
The audience isgonna go crazy
if you put this guy on.Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.- We're gonna go with it.
- [Arthur and Murray laugh]Thank you, Murray.Couple rules, though.No cursing.
No off-color material.We do a clean show.- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.I love Dr. Sally.Good, good.
Someone will- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.Good luck.- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.When you
bring me out,can you
introduce me as Joker?What's wrong
with your real name?That's what you
called me on the show.A joker.Do you remember?- Did I?
- [Gene] I don't know.Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.It's good.Thanks, Murray.[gun clicks][Murray] I'll try it,
you know,but I'm not sure my
wife will let me do it.[audience laughing]Maybe my next wife.- [Murray laughing]
- [audience cheering]You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.I'm pretty sure this
guy could use a doctor.- [audience laughing]
- [Dr. Sally] Oh!Does he have
sexual problems?[Murray] Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.[audience laughing]All right, Bobby,
let's show that clip one last time.[Arthur laughing
on video][Arthur] <i>I hated
school as a kid.</i><i>But my mother
would always say,</i>[imitates Penny]
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i><i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i>[normal voice]
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i><i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>[Arthur laughing on video]- [Murray] Okay. You may...
- [audience laughing]You may have seen that
clip of our next guest.Now, before he comes
out, I just want to saythat we're
all heartbrokenabout what's going on
in the city tonight.But this is how he
wanted to come out,and honestly,
I think we could all use a good laugh.So, please welcome, Joker.- [music playing]
- [audience applauding][audience cheering][audience whooping
and whistling]Are you
all right, Doctor?[audience laughing]Well,
that was quite an entrance.[scattered laughter
from audience]You okay?Yeah.This is exactly
how I imagined it.Well, that makes
one of us.[audience laughing][audience applauding]So, can you tell us
about this look?When we spoke earlier,you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.Is that right?That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.I'm just trying to
make people laugh.- And how's that going for you?
- [audience laughing][laughing]So, I know
you're a comedian.You been working on
any new material?You wanna
tell us a joke?[audience applauding]Yeah?Okay.[audience laughing]He's got a book.A book of jokes.Take your time.
We got all night.[audience laughing][Murray chuckles]Okay, okay.
Here's one.Knock, knock.And you had to
look that up?- [laughing]
- [audience laughing][audience applauding]I want to
get it right.Knock, knock.Who's there?It's the police, ma'am.Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.- He's dead. [laughing]
- [audience gasps][plays sad note]- [audience booing]
- Oh, no, no, no.No, you cannot
joke about that.Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.It's just, you know,
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.[chuckling]Ever sinceI killed those three
Wall Street guys.[all gasp]Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.There is
no punch line.- It's not a joke.
- [audience murmuring]You're serious,
aren't you?You're telling us
you killedthose three young men
on the subway?[Arthur] Mmm-hmm.And why should
we believe you?I got nothing
left to lose.Nothing can
hurt me anymore.[laughs]My life is
nothing but a comedy.[audience booing]Well, let me
get this straight,you think that killing
those guys is funny?I do.And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.Comedy is subjective,
Murray.Isn't that
what they say?All of you,the system
that knows so much,you decide
what's right or wrong.The same way that you
decide what's funny or not![man] Get him off!Well, okay,
I think I might understandthat you did this to
start a movement,to become a symbol?Come on, Murray.Do I look like
the kind of clownthat could
start a movement?I killed those guys
because they were awful.Everybody is awful
these days.It's enough to
make anyone crazy.[Murray] Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.That's your defense for
killing three young men?No.They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.[audience booing]Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,you'd walk
right over me!I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.But these guys, what,
because Thomas Waynewent and cried about them on TV?You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?Yes, I do.Have you seen what it's
like out there, Murray?Do you ever actually
leave the studio?Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.Nobody's civil anymore.Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever thinkwhat it's like to be
someone like me?To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.They think that
we'll just sit thereand take it,
like good little boys!That we won't werewolf
and go wild!You finished?I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.You sound like
you're making excusesfor killing
those young men.Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,not everyone is awful.You're awful, Murray.Me? I'm awful?Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?Playing my video.Inviting me
on this show.You just wanted to
make fun of me.You're just like
the rest of them.You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.Look what happened,
because of what you did. What it led to.There are riots
out there.Two policemen are
in critical condition,- and you're laughing.
- [laughs]You're laughing.Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.I know.How about another joke, Murray?No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.- What do you get...
- I don't think so....when you cross
a mentally-ill lonerwith a society
that abandons himand treats him
like trash?Call the police, Gene!- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.You get what you
fucking deserve![audience screaming][laughing]- [screaming continues]

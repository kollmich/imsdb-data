How's that going?The mother's bawling
and the uncle's pissed off.She's not married?Divorced with four kids.I guess Father
was helping out.Helping out?Hey, Mr. Burke,
they're in back talking to the bishop.And Father?
We put him in the break room.Any press?Some guy from the <i>Citizen</i>
but we sent him away.None of the big papers.Let's keep it that way.Who's that?
Assistant DA.It's gonna be hard to keep the
papers away from the arraignment.What arraignment?You can tell Father Geoghan
it won't be much longer.Now, Sheila, you know what good
work the church does in the community.But I give you
my personal guaranteethat I'm going to take
Father out of the parish,and this will never
happen again.We'll just be
another moment, Paul.Of course, Father.Now, Sheila, I'm going
to give you my personal card...Losing a good reporter
is always tough.But losing
one of our best...Well, to put it
as eloquently as I can,it's a real kick in the ass.But, Robby here
has known Stewartlonger than most of you
have been alive,so, I'll hand it off
to him. Robby.Oh, well, thanks, Ben.
I think.Although I take issue with your
reference to my seniority,I will say that Stewart's departure
is especially painful for mebecause, uh...
For what, Stewart?Twenty years now?Stewart's been more
than willing to partwith his money
at the poker table.And I've got a kid
in college.Yeah, but I'm gonna keep playing.
Oh, problem solved.Godspeed then.Now, Stewart, I find the
timing of your departuredisconcerting.The corner office sits empty,the new editor
arrives on Monday,so I'm sorry, buddy,
but I gotta ask ya.What the hell
do you know?How's the cake?It's really good.
Are you saving yours?Nah, it's for Mike.
I can never eat at those things.They kind of depress me.
I know.Did you see the numbers
from Washington?Yeah. Very interesting.
I think so, too.I'm not asking if the PD's lying,
I know they're lying.All I'm asking,
who's behind it?Oh. Okay, I get it.
You don't want to talk.No, Dan, I'm not mad,
I'm hungry.I've been talking here
so long I didn't eat lunch.So I'm gonna go
get something to eat,and that'll give you
an hour to decidewhether you want to be
on the right side of thisor read about it
like everybody else.Bye, Dan.You think
Cahill has something?Maybe. I just don't think
the story's for us.Ben likes it. Yeah, it's not bad,
it's just not Spotlight.What's just not Spotlight?The PD numbers.
The numbers story. It feels thin.Oh, you got Cahill to talk?No, but I will.Good. Then we'll know
if it's thin.- How'd it go upstairs?
- Oh, okay.- Robby gave a good speech.
- Sure he did.I heard Lubin and Connor
are going to the <i>Times.</i>- Come on, really?
- Yeah, I heard that.They're leeching us.Well, at least they're sending us
a guy from Miami to run things.That should help.Has Baron even
spent time in Boston?I don't think he's ever been here before.
Maybe we should buy him a map.I have a friend down in Miami
said he cut 15% of the staff.Great...
Hey, Robby.New boss coming in
to make some cuts?I have no idea.Aren't you sitting down
with him?Yes, I am.
So is it about Spotlight?I don't know, Mike,
but I do knowthat Ben needs an answer
on the crime numbers story.I'm telling you,
I really don't think that story's for us.Mr. Baron.Walter Robinson. Robby.Thanks for taking the time
out of your weekend.Oh, my pleasure.
Appreciate it.What are you reading?Uh...<i>The Curse of the Bambino.</i>Oh, yeah,
it's a great book.The <i>Globe</i> has
season tickets at Fenwayonce you're settled in,
by the way.Thank you.Uh, to be honest,
I'm not much of a baseball fan.I'm just trying to
get a feel for the city.Oh, yeah...So you're originally
from Boston?I am. Born and raised, yeah.A lot of the newsroom
is from here.It really feels like
a local paper in that way.And did that change at all after
the paper was sold to the <i>Times?</i>No. No, I don't think
that had a big impact.Good.And you're an editor
for the Spotlight team?I'd prefer to think of myself
as player coach. But yes.Are you familiar
with Spotlight?No, not particularly.Well, we are a four-person
investigative team.We report to
Ben Bradlee, Jr.,and we keep
our work confidential.What're you
working on now?We just put out a piece on a
shoddy construction outfit,and right now we're really just
trolling around for our next story.How long does
that typically take?Hard to say.
A couple months.Couple months?Yeah, we don't like to
rush it.Once we settle on a project, we can
spend a year or more investigating it.Is that a concern?
Not necessarily.Um, but from what I understand
readership is down,Internet is cutting into
the classified business, andI think I'm gonna need to
take a hard look at things.So, do you anticipate
more cuts?I think it's safe
to assume so,but what I'm more focused on
right now is finding a wayto make this paper
essential to its readers.I like to think
it already is.Fair enough. I just think
that we can do better.Mr. Bradlee.
Hey.Saw the PD numbers.
Looks interesting.Yeah, there's something there.How long do you need?
Another week.Where're you going?
10:30.Since when?Technically,
I am an editor.Technically.Your sit-down with Baron
go that well?I couldn't get a read on him.
That's a first.How about you?
Oh, he's a barrel of laughs.Morning, everyone.
Let's get started.Do you wanna
say something, Marty?Uh, sure.Uh, hello.As most of you know by now,
my name is Marty Baron,I'm delighted to be here.Um, if you could tell me your name
as we go around, that'd be helpful.Thank you.Okay. Peter?Peter Canellos, Metro.I've got a major
Big Dig closure.Hey, Steve. Hey.
Mike.Crappy game
last night, huh?Yeah, they can't hit
worth a nickel.Hey listen, what's Eileen McNamara
doing in the 10:30?Do you need something, Mike?
No, just curious.Go be curious somewhere else.
I got work to do, huh?Okay, Steve.See you.
Yeah.And it looks like Pedro's gonna
be out until September 1st.Jimmy says he'll be back this year,
but the doc didn't seem so sure.When's the Pats' opener?Is that everyone?Yes, that's it.
Okay. Good.Thank you. Uh...Did everyone read
Eileen McNamara's column this weekend?That's the Geoghan case?Yeah, what's the folo
on that?It's a column, what kind
of folo were you thinking?Uh, well, apparently
this priest molested kidsin six different parishes
over the last 30 years,and the attorney
for the victims, Mr...Garabedian.
Thanks, Eileen.Mr. Garabedian says
Cardinal Law found outabout it 15 years ago
and did nothing.Yeah, I think that
attorney's a bit of a crank,and the church
dismissed the claim.He said, she said.Whether Mr. Garabedian
is a crank or nothe says he has documents
that prove the cardinal knew.As I understand it,
those documents are under seal.Okay, but the fact remains,
a Boston priest abused 80 kids,we have a lawyer who says he
can prove Law knew about it,and we've written all of, uh,
two stories in the last six months.This strikes me as an essential
story to a local paper.I think at the very least, we have
to go through those documents.How would you
like to do that?Oh, uh...I don't know
what the laws are here,but in Florida
we would go to court.You want to sue the church?Technically we wouldn't
sue the church.We'd file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents.The church will read that
as us suing them.So will everybody else.Good to know.Gutsy call
for the first day.That's one word for it.How do you think that's
gonna play down front?I think Gilman's
gonna shit a brick.Hey.
Door.How'd it go?Well, Baron wants to sue for the
sealed docs in the Geoghan case.Wants to sue the church?
Hey, that's great.We covered Geoghan when the
story broke three years ago.Baron was still in Miami.I think he might have been
at the <i>Times</i> then, actually.He wasn't here.So do you think
that suit has a chance?Depends on the judge.And what parish he belongs to.Bradlee. Yeah.Okay.Baron wants to talk to us.Us?Okay, Jon. Thank you.Yes. Okay, thanks.I've set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsel.Jon Albano?
Yeah.Who's the judge
in this case?Um...Constance Sweeney.Tough.
Why's that?Good Catholic girl.
Huh.So, um,judging from what I've read,
it doesn't seem like we've donea very thorough investigation
into the Geoghan case.Is that right?
No, it's not.We looked hard at Geoghan.David Armstrong from Metro,
Michael Paulson for Religion.Okay, but, uh,
just so I understand,beyond our daily coverage,
we haven't...We haven't committed any long-term
investigative resourcesto the question of whether or not
Cardinal Law knew about this?No, we haven't.And that's the kind of thing
your team would do?Spotlight? Well, yeah.But we're still prospecting the
Boston PD story I told you about.Could you set that aside?We could.Marty, in past Spotlight's
had success in large partbecause they pick
their own projects.Would you consider
picking this one?I don't know if
he's writing about you,but I will let him know
you called.Okay, bye.Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?Okay. Uh...Baron wants us to scrub
the Geoghan case.That's great.
Didn't we cover Geoghan?Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging
Cardinal Law knew about it.- Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right?
- Yeah.I covered him
at the courthouse.Can you get to him?
I only interviewed him once.He's kind of a character.I like characters.
I'll take him.Good. You take him.Also, we should be
talking to, uh,the lawyer who repped the
victims in the Porter case.Eric Macleish.
Uh-huh.That guy was always on TV.
Yeah, the Porter case?Remind me.
Yeah, um, Father Porter, similar story.Molested dozens of kids in
Fall River about 10 years ago.So, we're dropping
the Boston PD?I vote yes.
No, no.We just gotta set
it aside for now.Listen, I don't need
to tell you guys this.We need to be more
discreet than usual.All right?Everybody's gonna be interested in this,
not just the <i>Herald.</i>We can't let Cardinal Law get wind
of this until we know what we have.Good luck with that.<i>So when
do you leave, Nana?</i>The bus is picking us up in the
church parking lot at 9:00.We have 40 people going.And is Father Dominic going?No, he says
he's unlucky.But luck has nothing
to do with it.You know, last time Nana won $160.
Wow.You gonna tell her?We don't even know
if there's a story yet.Well, <i>"Globe</i> sues church"?
It's gonna be a story.Hey, Lisa. Could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me?Yeah.Is this for Spotlight?Just drop them off
when they're ready? Thanks.Excuse me, do you know where
the publisher's office is?Will do.How are you, Marty?Settling in?Yeah, I think so.
Good.What can I do for you?Um...I'd like to challenge the protective
order in the Geoghan case.You want to sue
the Catholic Church?Um...We're just
filing a motion, but...Yes.You think
it's that important?Yes, I do.Because obviously the Church
will fight us very hard on this.Which won't go unnoticed
by our subscriber base.53% of them are Catholic.Mmm-hmm.I think
they'll be interested.Okay.Marty, Lake Street
will probably contact youabout a face-to-face
with the Cardinal.It's customary.Yeah. They already have.
It's set up for next week.I wouldn't mention this.Hello?Hello?Can I help you?
Oh, hi.I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>I'm here to see
Mitchell Garabedian.He's on a call.
Please have a seat.Okay.All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.Okay.Bill! Where the hell
are those papers?I asked you to
put 'em on my desk!The famous Walter Robinson
in my conference room.Good to see you again, Eric.Sacha Pfeiffer,
Eric Macleish.Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.You don't play golf,
do you?Uh, no.
Good.Your colleague here
took some money off meat a charity event
last year.It was a very lucky putt. I actually
had my eyes closed, by the way.Mmm-hmm.So, how can I help
you guys?Uh...You're familiar
with the Geoghan case?Sure.Eighty plaintiffs.
All of them individual cases.Garabedian must be swimming.Well. And the allegations
against Cardinal Law?Yeah, it's tricky. Um...This is what you need to understand.
These are shitty cases.The statute of limitations
is only three years,and most of these victims don't
come forward until long after that.Oh. Why is that?Well, they're kids,
you know.Guilt, shame.And most of these kids come
from tough neighborhoods.Nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing.So, you're screwed
on the time limit.And, uh,even if you argue
your way around thatthe charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand.Twenty grand for
molesting a child?That is the way
the system is set up. Yes.The Church is tough.So, your best shot
is to try these casesin the press
like I did on Porter.Hmm. But, you know,
most of the victims,they don't wanna have
anything to do with TV.And, uh,Mitch isn't exactly
a people person.Yeah, and if Garabedian
can't get his victimsto go before the press,
then he's really...That's right.
He has a long road ahead of him.My guess is he doesn't
have anything on Law.What? You think
he's bluffing or...I think he's grandstanding
to cut a better deal.Seems a bit reckless.Have you met
Mitch Garabedian?I asked you to write up that motion,
Bill. I didn't ask you to file it.Hey, Bill, here's
the case files from yesterday.Hi.Who are you?
I'm Mike Rezendes from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>I had an appointment
with you about an hour ago.I can't talk to you.
I'm very busy. Sharon!No, no. She went out for coffee.
She said she'd be right back.I'm following up
on an article.The one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>
No. In the <i>Globe.</i>Did you see
the one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>No, I didn't.
I thought it was very good.I have a copy here somewhere.That's all right.
I'll track it down.I'm actually
following up on a columnthat Eileen McNamara
wrote about your suit.Suits.
There are 84 of them.It's not a class action.You should get your facts straight.
No, you're right. I should.So I'm trying to get some
background information on...You're not
recording this, are you?No, I wouldn't do
that without asking.I can't show you those Church's
documents if that's what you're after.They're under seal.Yeah, I know that.Did you know that
they tried to bring me upbefore the Massachusetts Board
of Bar Overseers three times?They're watching me
very closely.The Church?
Yeah. The Church. Yeah.They'd like to get me disbarred.
In fact, put that away.Put it away.
Sure.I don't want you recording this
in any way, shape or form.Not on paper,
not on tape, nothing.In fact, I probably shouldn't
even be speaking to you. So...Look, Mr. Garabedian,I know there's things
you cannot tell me,but I also know
there's a story here.And I think
it's an important story.I already talked
to the <i>Phoenix.</i>Yeah, and there's a reason
I didn't see it.Nobody reads
the <i>Phoenix</i> anymore.They're broke.
They don't have any power.The <i>Globe</i> does.If we cover this story,
everybody will hear about it.The Church thinks
in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.Do you think your paper has the
resources to take that on?Yeah, I do.But if you don't
mind me asking,do you?I can't talk to you right now,
Mr. Rezendes, I'm very, very busy.Sharon? Yeah.
Thank you.Can I at least talk to some
of your clients? The victims?I'd really like
to do that.Call me tomorrow, I gotta think about it.
Thank you.Thanks.
Yeah, yeah.I got more clips
from the library.Leave 'em right there.Are you guys doing
a story on the Church?No, we are not doing
a story on the Church.Matt, you find anything
on this guy, Phil Saviano?No. Who is he?He's part of
a victims' organization.Kurkjian did a story on him
right after the Porter case.There's a victims'
organization?Yeah, it's called SNAP.It's Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priests.- Crummy acronym.
- Hmm.You want me to track him down?
Yeah. Bring him in.How much longer you need
to get through the clips?I mean, a few days.
There's a lot.Lisa's still sending up more.
Okay.Hey, guys. I think I got
another priest.Liam Barrett.
Molested some kids in Phillyand was moved to Boston.Did the same thing
and was moved again.Really?
That sounds like Geoghan.Is that one of our clips?Yeah. Byline's
Diego Ribadeneira, 1997.Must've been back when
he was working Religion.Was there any folo?
Not much. One short piece.Huh.
The Church settled the case.Don't you know
Jim Sullivan?Yeah. Why?Looks like the Church
brought him in to help out.Jesus...Has anybody but Manny gotten
the ball out of the infield?Nope. Why do you even
bother with that thing?It distracts me
from the game.Know what else
is good for that?Oh, yeah. Good idea.
My round. I'll be right back.Anybody want any food?
No.I'm all set.
Hey, a hot dog.So you guys
making any progress?Absolutely. It's a good story.
Why?Because you're another lapsed
Catholic pissed off at the Church?We've got a lot of good stuff.
Like what?I'm just watching the game.
OmertÃ .They got another priest,
Liam Barrett.We reported on him.I'm just saying, we did.
Okay,but this guy was shuffled around from
parish to parish every few years,just like Geoghan
and Porter.I think there's a pattern.Sounds thin.
What else you got?Sacha's got another guy from a
victims' organization, Phil Saviano.From SNAP? Oh, boy.
We reported on him, too.I thought you were watching
the game, Steve.That guy's pretty
banged up, Mike.We did a couple
stories on him.That guy would not
stop writing letters.He wants a holy war.What? So he's not
worth talking to?Where are you
on Garabedian?I'm working on it.Robby said Macleish
thinks he's bluffing.I think there's
something there, Ben.Get me something solid,
or I'm taking you off it.I don't want us chasing
our tails on this.Stay away
from that trap.You couldn't reach that
trap in a million years, partner.I've reached that trap before.Yeah? Now Paul, maybe.- How we doing?
- We're good.We're two up in the front.Good.How's that new editor
working out?Well, he doesn't
like baseball.But he seems like
a smart guy.Yeah, I read an article
about him.Said he's the first
Jewish editor at the <i>Globe.</i>Must have been
a slow news day.He got a family,
this guy?No. He is not married.Divorced?
I don't think so, no.So the new editor of the <i>Globe</i> is an
unmarried man of the Jewish faithwho hates baseball?Yeah.
Should have given it to Ben.He's a Bradlee,
for crying out loud.Didn't raise his hand
fast enough, I guess.Hey, by the way,I've been reading about this priest,
Father Barrett.Said you were
involved with that.Barrett, yeah. Bad egg.Lake Street asked
for help, I pitched in.Victims said Cardinal Law knew about
Barrett when he came from Philly.Is that true?You know I can't talk
about the case, Robby.Off the record?Off the record
I can't talk about it.All right.
This related to the lawsuit?You know about that?Look,I don't know this guy Baron
or what his agenda is.Frankly, I don't care.I just don't want to see you
taking a bullet for him.I think you're away.Put it over here.
Let's go. Let's go.<i>So the other day
I was on the World Wide Web.</i><i>Anything you want to know.
It's right there.</i>Now, I have to admit
that as a priest,this makes me
a little nervous.Should I be worried
about job security?I don't think so.<i>You see,
knowledge is one thing,</i><i>but faith...</i><i>Faith is another.</i>Hey.Hey.Shouldn't you be
golfing or something?Golfing's not a verb.And I couldn't get
a tee time.Is that what they call it?
"Tee time"?They also call it "a leisure activity."
You ought to try it, Mike.I do. I run.
Yeah, you run to work.So why are you here today?Going over these clips
of Saviano.Yep, Ben and Steve
think it's a dead end.They gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game.Yeah, Ben emailed me.He did?
Yeah.He said we should
let it go.What do you wanna do?I wanna bring Saviano in.So, just ignore those guys?I think we've got to start
ignoring everybody on this one.I'm good with that.Mmm.Do you think Marty has any idea
what's coming down the pike?Nope. I don't think
he cares either.That's refreshing.Yeah.Unless he's wrong.<i>I've always been
fascinated with the newspaper business.</i>I used to sit in on the lectures
with the Nieman fellowswhen I was at Harvard.I read that you were
an editor once.Oh, yes.Yeah, that was
a very long time ago.The <i>Mississippi Register.</i>Small, diocesan newspaper.But for a 30-year-old pastor,
it was a big responsibility.Too much at times.How so?I was close with
the Evers brothers.We took a stand
on civil rights.Our readership
was not pleased.They saw me
as a meddling outsider.I can imagine.Tough seat to sit in,especially in a small town.I think you'll find that Boston's
still a small town, too, Marty,in many ways.But if I can be of any help,
Marty, don't hesitate to ask.I find that
the city flourisheswhen its great institutions
work together.Thank you.Personally I'm of the opinion that for
a paper to best perform its function,it really needs
to stand alone.Ah. Of course.But my offer still stands.Thank you.Come in.Ah!Thank you, Maureen.A little gift, Marty.Think of it as a Cardinal's
guide to the city of Boston.I'm here to see
Sacha Pfeiffer.Your name?
Phil Saviano.Okay, just a minute.So am I the first
survivor you've talked to?Yeah, Phil.
You are.Okay, well...First of all, let me say thank you
for having me in today.And I want you to knowthat you have the full cooperation
of my organization, SNAP.How many members are in
your organization, Phil?We had 11 at
our last chapter meeting...Uh, no, 10.
Karen just moved.You had a woman
in your group?Of course there was a woman.
They don't discriminate,not when it comes to abuse.And this has nothing
to do with being gay.What this is, is priests using
the collar to rape kids.Kids. Boys and girls.I was 11,and I was preyed upon by Father
David Holley in Worcester.And I don't mean prayed for.
I mean preyed upon.Are any of you Catholic?I was raised Catholic.
Now I go to my wife's Presbyterian church.I'm lapsed.I go to church with
my grandmother sometimes.It's safe to say we were all
raised Catholic, but now...Not so much.Okay. Well,
let me tell you.When you're a poor kid from a poor
family, religion counts for a lot.And when a priest pays attention
to you, it's a big deal.He asks you to collect
the hymnalsor take out the trash,
you feel special.It's like God
asking for help.So maybe it's a little weird
when he tells you a dirty joke,but now you got a secret
together, so you go along.Then he shows you a porno mag,
and you go along.And you go along,
and you go along,until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blow job.And so you go along
with that, too,because you feel trapped,because he has groomed you.How do you say
no to God, right?See,it is important to understand that
this is not just physical abuse,it's spiritual abuse, too.And when a priest does this to you,
he robs you of your faith.So you reach for
the bottle or the needle.Or if those don't work,
you jump off a bridge.That's why we call
ourselves survivors.Have you read
Jason Berry's book?He wrote about the Gauthe
case in Louisiana?Uh, that's "G"...
G-A-U-T-H-E.Here. And talk to
Richard Sipe.He worked in one of the
Church's treatment centers.He's an ex-priest,married a nun.Here.This is his testimony
from the Kos case.Uh, Phil,
what's a treatment center?It's where they send priests
when they get caught.This is all right here
in the box,I sent this all to you guys
five years ago.Uh, to the <i>Globe?</i>
Who did you send it to?I don't wanna say who, but they
said that they weren't interested.Uh, but Phil, we did run a
couple of stories on you.I saw them in the clips.Yeah, but to be completely frank,
it wasn't enough.You guys gotta understand,this is big.This is not just Boston. It's the
whole country. It's the whole world.And it goes right
up to the Vatican.Do you have any
proof of that, Phil?No, not yet. But think about it,
there are so many of them.How else could they have
hidden it for so long?So many what?
Priests!Priests!I know of 13
right here in Boston.You know 13 priests in Boston
who have molested children?Yeah, why do you keep
repeating everything I say?I just like to
clarify things.Maybe you should have
clarified it five years agowhen I sent you
all of this stuff!It's all right here!May I use your bathroom?Yeah, sure, Phil.Come on.Well, what do you think?Well, the guy, he's got an agenda,
that's for sure.You think?
He's obviously been through a lot.But he's smart, and if he's
right about 13 priests...Yeah, it might be
a big "if" with this guy.Do a background check
on him,and follow up with some of the
other survivors of his group.I'll track down
this ex-priest, Sipe.Okay, but stay on Garabedian.
That's more important.Garabedian,
what a pain in the ass.You can be a pain
in the ass, Mike.Mmm.Mitchell, what a surprise.
How are you?I'm fine, Mr. Rezendes.
Good.You know, I haven't heard back from you.
I left you a couple of messages.I know. I've been very busy.
I don't have time for calls.Oh, jeez,
I'm sure you don't.Listen, listen, Mitch, let me
talk to a couple of the victims.You could sit in
on the interview,and if you're not happy,
you could kill it.I spoke to my clients, and they don't
want to be in the press. I'm sorry.I get that, but I don't need
to name names.I don't believe you, Mr. Rezendes.
I'm sure you don't.I don't.
Listen, Mitchell.Look, Mr. Rezendes,
please...I'm not writing
a profile here.I'm working on something bigger.
Bigger?I don't know
what that means.I'm not supposed
to tell you this,but I'm digging around
for Spotlight.Spotlight's on this?
Yeah, we're looking into it,but you gotta help me.You gotta let me talk to some
of these victims, please.Please.Come back tomorrow.
9:30 a.m.Thank you.Ms. Pfeiffer?
Joe?Hi.
Oh, shoot.Oh, that's okay.
Sorry.No, no problem.
Please sit.Thank you.Is this table okay?This is perfect.I had a muffin
while I was waiting.Two, actually.I eat when I'm nervous.
I do that, too, actually.I hope I'm not late.
Phil told me 1:00.No, you're fine.
I got here early.About an hour.Um, would you mind if I took some notes?
Would that be all right?You don't mind
if I take some notes, do you?- Are you going to use my name?
- No.Not if you don't
want me to. No.I just had a kid.He's only one, but I'm not sure
I want him to know about this.Sure. I get that.You can stop this interview
at any time, Patrick.All right?
Okay.Go ahead with your notes.Okay. So, um...Where'd you live
when it first happened?In the projects,
over in Hyde Park.Over by the Stop & Shop?Yeah, you know it?Yeah, I drove a cab
for a few years.Open early.
Bad coffee, right?Yeah, I guess.How old were you
when it happened?I was 12.Just after my dad
killed himself.Ah, jeez.He was a real
piece of shit.And my mom,
she wasn't so stable either.How do you mean?
I mean, she was nuts.She was a schizophrenic.
Same shit.When did you
first meet Geoghan?Well, my sister,she saw him over
in the Dunkin' Donuts.Tells him about my old man passing,
and he rushed right over.And there was this nun,
Sister Barbara,and she ran this group for
kids from troubled families.Mmm-hmm.Where was that?St. Ambrose in Dorchester.
Okay.She's the one who introduced
me to Father Shanley.He was a street priest.Long hair. Very hip.He invited me to his
apartment in Back Bay.Where in Back Bay?
Beacon Street.Beacon. Okay.Are you from here?Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio,
but my mom's from Southie.Okay, so you get it.
I'd never even seen Back Bay.So what happened
on that first visit, Joe?Well, he was very nice
at first,very funny, very casual.And I think he could tell
I was gay,so he showed me this mobile he had,
like, over a baby's crib?Mmm-hmm.But with different words."Homosexual,
transsexual, bisexual."Okay, and did you know you
were gay at that time, Joe?Yeah.But that wasn't information
I was sharing with anybody.Not in Dorchester.Okay.So, what happened after
he showed you the mobile?Well, I was
a little freaked out.Mmm-hmm.I think he could tell,so he said, "You know what'll
help is if we play strip poker."Course I lost.And, uh, things went on
from there.Can you tell me
specifically what happened?Specifically, he...He molested me.Joe, I think that the language is
going to be so important here.We can't sanitize this.
Just saying "molest" isn't enough.People need to know
what actually happened.We should probably get these to go.
Right.Geoghan shows up,
and my mom, you know, she's...She's thrilled.
I mean...This was like God
showing up, you know?Sure. Right.So what happened then?You really want to
hear this shit?Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do.He offers to take me
to get ice cream.And, you know, he's a priest.
I'm a kid, so I go.Sure.
So we're driving home and he...He starts patting my leg,you know, thenhis hand just slides right up,
and he grabs my dick.You know, I just froze up.
I was fucking petrified, I couldn't move.I didn't know what to do.
I was just a little kid.Yeah.You know, I never even
touched my ice cream.It just melted down my arm.Did you, um...Did you see him again
after that?Yeah.All right. That's good.
Let's stop there for now.Sure.He said it was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body.Mmm.So what happened
after that?Well, he took off his
clothes, and he said,"I've been so depressed,"but maybe you can cheer me
up and give me a blow job."Classy guy.And did you?
Yeah.I know what you must be thinking,
like, why would I ever do thatto some creepy guy who's 30
years older than me, but...What you have to understand is that
this is the first time in my lifethat someone told me that it
was okay to be gay. Mmm-hmm.And it was a priest.
Right.So you had oral sex.
Did you have intercourse?Yes.Not then, but later.It really
messed me up.I'm sober now, but that...
That was the beginning of it all.It's very confusing,
you know,to be introduced to sex
like that and then...And then to be
attracted to men, it's...I'm sorry.
I knew I was gonna do this.Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.It's okay, Joe.
It's okay.Of course there is a
church right there.And a playground.Joe, did you ever
try and tell anyone?Like who? A priest?Can I use your phone?Yeah, sure.
You know where it is.You can use my name
if you want.Thanks, Patrick.Don't thank me,
just get these assholes, will you?He's one of the lucky ones.He's still alive.Do you want
a cup of tea, Sacha?I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.
Okay.<i>Hello.</i>
Hi, Joe, it's Sacha Pfeiffer.<i>Hi, Sacha. How are you?</i>
I'm good, thanks.Listen, Joe, I just wanted
to follow up on one thing.You talked to Phil Saviano
about all of this, right?<i>Yeah, I did.
I went to a couple of SNAP meetings.</i>And did Phil ever suggest
you do anything about it?<i>No.</i><i>The meetings
weren't really about that.</i><i>I mean, a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer,</i><i>but I didn't think
it was worth it.</i>Why not?<i>There were just so
many forms to fill out.</i><i>It was overwhelming,
you know.</i><i>And he said it could only get
me a small settlement, so...</i>Who, who said that?
<i>The lawyer told me that.</i>So you did go
and see a lawyer?<i>Yeah, but I didn't
end up using him,</i><i>so I didn't think
it was important.</i><i>I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to hide anything.</i>No, I know, Joe.Do remember his name?
The lawyer?<i>No, but maybe Phil
would know.</i><i>The guy was on TV a lot
during the Porter case.</i><i>He was handsome.</i>Was it Eric Macleish?<i>Yeah, that's it. Macleish.</i><i>I thought
he was very handsome.</i>Hey.
Hey.I was just in the newsroom.
Judge Sweeney set a date for the hearing.Really? When?Two weeks, in Springfield.Canellos started a pool.
Ten bucks to get in.Anyone picking the <i>Globe?</i>He's only taking bets on how
fast Sweeney rules against us.- Robby.
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i><i>Did you get my message?</i>
I did.Looks like Father Shanley
could be our fourth priest.<i>Yeah, I think he is.</i>Did you follow up
with Macleish?<i>I just talked to Phil.</i><i>He said Macleish dealt with
a number of these cases.</i><i>Guess he forgot to mention that.</i>
Yeah.I'm gonna go to
the courthouse tomorrow,see if I can find any cases he
settled against the Church.<i>All right. Call me
after you do. Good night.</i>Okay, good night.Hey.You wanted to chat?Yeah, I'm late for a dinner.
You wanna walk me out?Sure.Jeez.Does this guy ever go home?
Apparently not.I got guys who won't leave
till he does.He's wearing out the goddamn newsroom.Where are we on Geoghan?Following up
on more victims.Hey, I want to expand
the investigation.Why?
We got a fourth priest.There might be
as many as 13.Thirteen?
Yeah.Who's your source?
Phil Saviano.Oh, Jesus Christ, Robby, I told Mike...
I know, I know...I think Saviano
might be legit, Ben.You wanna elaborate
on that?No. Not really.It just feels like this thing's
stacking up. It's my gut.Okay.
Okay. Good.Thank you.Hello?<i>Mr. Rezendes?</i>
Uh, yeah. Who's this?<i>It's Richard Sipe.</i>Oh, yeah. Hey, Richard, how are you?
<i>I'm good.</i>Uh, thanks
for calling. Look...Phil Saviano
gave me your name.I was wondering if I can
ask you a few questions.<i>Of course. Yeah.</i>
Great.So, Phil told me
that you were workingat one of the Church's treatment
centers in Baltimore?<i>Yes. The Seton
Psychiatric Institute.</i><i>It was run by
the Daughters of Charity.</i>And, uh,
when was that, Richard?<i>Well, I started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965,</i><i>and I was there
for five years,</i><i>but I spent the next 30 studying
abusive priests and their victims.</i>Really?
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>And that's been
your sole focus?<i>Look, Mike,</i><i>the Church wants us to believe
that it's just a few bad apples.</i><i>But it's a much
bigger problem than that.</i>How much bigger, Richard?<i>Well, based on the research,</i><i>I would classify it as a
recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.</i>That's big.Hey, Mac.
Hey.If I wanted historical
data on a priest,parishes he'd been
assigned to,where would I find that?The Geoghan case? It's all in the clips.
Lisa has the source material.Yeah, what if it was
for another priest?One that hadn't been
in the papers.You're looking at another priest?
Who're you looking at?Any ideas?Oh, come on, Matt,
you're not going to tell me?I gotta get to a meeting.
Thanks, Mac.Hey, Steve.The archdiocese puts
out an annual directory.Every priest and parish.
That's great.Do these go back
any further than '98?Oh, yeah. Going back to
the '80s in the mez.Beyond that you gotta
go to the BPL.In the mez, huh? Thanks, Lisa.
You bet.He said they all target
the same kind of kid.Low-income families,
absentee fathers, broken homes.So a guy like Geoghan goes after
boys not because he prefers them,but because they have
more shame.Less likely to talk.These guys
are predators, Robby.And I talked to Sipe.
He said he'd seen dozens of themin the '60s in Seton.He called it
a "phenomenon."Why didn't he go public?
He did,but the Church made a huge
effort to discredit him.Smear campaigns,
public statements by prominent bishops.It's just like Saviano said,
and Garabedian.You getting anywhere
with him?More victims.
More victims.You can't empty his pockets?
I'll get to him.I just need more time.
Oh, come on, Mike.You gotta get him.
I'll get him, I'll get him.Jesus. What the hell
is that smell?There's a dead rat
in the corner.What have you got?
Church directories.It's every priest
in Massachusetts.What parish
they're assigned to.Are these official?
Yeah.I figured it could
help us track downsome of the priests
that Saviano mentioned.Maybe find
some more victims.Can we turn on some more lights?
I couldn't find the switch.You wanna borrow my glasses?
No, I'm good. I'm good.Look, 1983. John Geoghan,
St. Brendan Parish, Dorchester.So we can find out where any
priest is in any given year?Yeah, I got him here at...Huh.What?1980, the year Geoghan was pulled from JP.
It says he's on sick leave.Come on.
It really says that?Where is, uh, 1991?Here ya go.
Let me see this.Barrett. Barrett. Liam.I can't read that.
Look for a Liam Barrett in there.1991's the year they pulled
him out of Charlestown.Barrett, Liam.Yeah.
"Sick leave."It's an official designation.Let's get these upstairs.And, Matt, check on those
priests Saviano gave us.- Robby. Yeah.
<i>- Hey, I'm down at the courthouse.</i>Something's not right here.
Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.Okay, thanks.Yeah, we need to go talk
to Macleish again.<i>Really, why?</i>
Huh? There's nothing here.There aren't any records,
I checked every name.Thanks for waiting. So sorry, guys.
Stuck on a call.Not a problem.
How are you? Good.Thanks for meeting us.
You bet. What's up, guys?Mr. Macleish, are you familiar
with a priest named Paul Shanley?Yes, I am familiar
with him.And have you settled cases
against Father Shanley?As I'm sure you can understand,
I can't discuss that with you.How about, uh,
Father Ronald Paquin?Well, I can't discuss that with you either.
Come on, guys.We understand you've settled several
cases against each of them.Even if I'd been involved
in those cases,the settlements
would be confidential,and I could be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence.Okay?
Mmm-hmm.Look, I told you guys,
these are tough cases.Most of these folks, they
just want some acknowledgmentof what happened.We got 'em a sit-down with the
bishop and a little dough,and that's the best
they could hope for.Well, it's certainly the best
the priests could hope for.No, the Church promised they'd take
the priests out of circulation.And did you follow up
on that?Do you guys
need anything else?Yes. Why aren't there
any records?I was down at
the courthouse earlier.There aren't any records
of any of these settlements.We dealt directly
with the Church.We would draw up a demand letter
and send it to the chancery.You never filed
anything in court?It's a private mediation.So, this is just you
and the archdiocese's lawyersin a room?Correct.Anyone else?Occasionally, the Church would bring in
another defense attorney to help out.You have names?Nope.No, I don't.So this was all
under the table?There's no paper trail.
At all.The victim has to sign
a confidentiality agreementto get the settlement.The lawyer takes a third and the
Church sweeps it under the rug.Jeez,
it's a freakin' racket.It's more complicated
than that.Macleish's got a duty to the client
to get the best deal he can.Sure, but how many victims do
you represent and profit frombefore you say something?Garabedian would say none.That's why he's taking
these cases to courtbecause he wants people
to know about this.I agree.
And legal ethics aside, Ben,I mean, operating
the way Macleish hasall but guarantees that the
abuse stays under wraps.Yeah. Did Macleish confirm
all Saviano's priests?No. He's limited by his
confidentiality agreement.But clearly he's settled cases
against a number of them.Phil's put me in touch with
some of the other victims,I'm pretty confident all of his
priests are gonna check out.So it is 13 priests?Yeah.
Looks that way.Holy shit.Okay. Keep going.I'm sorry.
What was the name again?Uh, Baron.B-A-R-O-N.I'm having trouble finding it.
Just give me a second.It's okay, Kim,
I can vouch for him.I'm Pete Conley, I'm on the
board of Catholic Charities.Welcome to Boston,
Mr. Baron.Thank you.
I appreciate you joining us.We're very proud of the
work we do here at Boston.Oh, the Cardinal said
you had a nice visit.Yes, we did.He's an extraordinary man.
I'm glad you had a chance to chat.Enjoying yourself?Uh, to be honest, these events
aren't really my strong suit.Yeah. Are you involved
with the charity?Not directly, no.
Several of my friends are.We all went to high school.
BC High.That's the school across
the street from the <i>Globe.</i>It's hard to miss.
Yeah.Hard to get away from,
too, apparently.The Cardinal's in the corner
if you're so inclined.We've met.
Really?Did he mention the suit?No, but he did give me a
copy of the catechism.Yeah, well, the Cardinal's
not known for his subtlety.During the Porter investigation,he'd literally called down the
power of God on the <i>Globe.</i>How'd that play out?A week later our editor
broke his leg skiing.Shrimp toast,
gentlemen?No, thanks.
No.You said one of the victims
filed a criminal complaint?Yeah, there were
a few of them.But the judge had
the case records sealedafter friends of
the Church complained.And the Church has
a lot of friends.Like Eric Macleish?Yeah.Let's just say he's not
part of the solution.You follow what I'm saying?
Sure.You work hard,
Mr. Rezendes.Are you married?
Yeah.Your wife doesn't mind you
working all the time?Oh, yeah, she does.That's why I never got married.
I'm too busy.What I do
is too important.Hmm.Your new editor,
he's a Jew right?Oh, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, see,he comes in and suddenly everybody's
interested in the Church.You know why?Because it takes
an outsider, like me.I'm Armenian.How many Armenians
do you know in Boston?Steve Kurkjian,
works at the <i>Globe.</i>Oh, that's two.
You should get a prize or something.What are you, Italian?
No, I'm Portuguese.From where?
East Boston.Really? East Boston?You don't sound like it.This city, these people,making the rest of us
feel like we don't belong.But they're no better
than us.Look at how they treat
their children.Mark my words,
Mr. Rezendes,if it takes a village
to raise a child,it takes a village
to abuse one.Hey, here he is. Want a beer?
Love one.Another.
You here with Barbara?No, she hates these things.
Karen, too.Yeah.
Smart ladies.<i>SlÃ¡inte.</i>Mmm.I met your new editor.Seemed like a decent fellow.
I think he is.Hey, I had an interesting conversation
with Eric Macleish the other day.Turns out he's been settling abuse
cases with the archdiocese for years.You really wanna
talk about this here?Jim, you said you helped out
on Father Barrett as a favor.That was a one-off?How many of these cases
have you been involved with?You know I can't answer that, Robby.
It's unethical.Is that all it is?So, this would be
the Robby RobinsonI've always heard about
but never met.Listen to me, Jimmy.You wanna be on
the right side of this.This is the Church
you're talking about, Robby.Look around.
These are good people,done a lot of good
for this city.Enjoy the party.I've been through
a lot of these now."Sick leave" isn't the
only designation they usewhen they take one of these
priests out of circulation.They use a slew of terms.
"Absent on leave,""unassigned,"
"emergency response."They got a word for everything, these guys.
Hmm. Except "rape."And they move parishes way more
frequently than other priests.When I was a kid,
a priest movedafter seven or eight years,
sometimes longer.These guys, it's two
to three years tops.And did they use these designations
for all of Saviano's priests?Yeah, it's a pretty
clear pattern.Guys, I got Sipe.<i>I think if you really
want to understand the crisis,</i><i>you need to start with
the celibacy requirement.</i><i>That was my first
major finding.</i><i>Only 50% of the clergy
are celibate.</i><i>Now, most of them are having
sex with other adults.</i><i>But the fact remains that this
creates a culture of secrecy</i><i>that tolerates and
even protects pedophiles.</i>So you believe the Church is aware
of the extent of this crisis?<i>Oh, absolutely. After the first
major scandal in Louisiana,</i><i>Tom Doyle, the secretary-canonist
for the papal nuncio,</i><i>co-authored a report
warning pedophile priests</i><i>were a
billion-dollar liability.</i><i>That was in 1985.</i>1985?
<i>That's right.</i>Who saw that report?
Anyone from the Catholic hierarchy?<i>Sure.</i><i>Doyle tried to introduce
the report at</i><i>the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.</i><i>In fact, Cardinal Law initially
helped to fund the report.</i><i>But then he backed out,
and they shelved it.</i>Are you kidding me?Richard, Robby here.We think we have 13 priests in
Boston that fit this pattern,which would be
a very, very big story.Does that sound right to you
in terms of scale?<i>No, not really, Robby.
It sounds low to me.</i><i>My estimates suggest 6% act
out sexually with minors.</i>Uh, 6% of what?<i>6% of all priests.</i>How many priests
do we have in Boston?About 1,500.
1% is 15.6% is90.All right, 90 priests.
Is that possible?<i>From a metric standpoint,</i><i>yes, that would certainly be
in line with my findings.</i><i>Hello?</i>Uh...Ninety fucking priests?
In Boston?That's what he said.If there were 90 of these bastards,
people would know.Maybe they do.And no one said a thing?Good Germans?I don't think that's a comparison
you want to make publically.Macleish knew.
He just didn't say anything.That's 13 priests.There's a big difference
between 13 and 90.Where's this guy Sipe
getting his numbers?Well, he's been studying
it for 30 years.He is a trained
psychotherapist.Okay, but we need something
more than a metricfrom some hippy ex-priest
who's shacking up with a nun.Okay, so we'll track down more victims.
We'll get more priests.Then we can check them
against the directories.That's a shitload
of victims.We'll get there.How long's it gonna take?Too long.Wait, but...
Meeting's over?Yeah, for now.Look, what've you got?
What if we work backwards?What do you mean? From what?
From the directories.We've been using them
to confirm bad priests.What if we do it
the other way around?Use the directories to identify
bad priests. Yeah, exactly.We search by designation.We look for any priest on
"sick leave" or "unassigned."Or have been moved around a lot.
Yeah.It's gonna take
a load of work.Well, not if we're
all on it.You, too?Generally that's what "all" means. Yeah.
Yeah, generally.Library is closing.Library is closing.Holy shit.No freakin' way.- Talbot.
- Yeah.- Tivnan.
- Yeah.Toma.
Yeah.Turnbull.
Yeah.Walsh.
Yeah.Welsh.
Yeah.That's it.
That's it.Holy shit.
Robby?That's three off Sipe's estimate.
That's incredible.Robby?How many?
Eighty-seven.Eighty-seven priests
in Boston.Call Macleish. I wanna talk to him.
Okay.Can you print it?
Sure can.<i>Jim Sullivan's office.</i>Yeah, Walter Robinson
for Jim Sullivan.Tell him it's important,
please.<i>One moment, please.</i><i>Hey, Robby.
Everything okay?</i>I need you
to tell me something, Jim.Could it be 90 priests?<i>What?</i>
Could it be as high as 90?<i>Jesus, Robby.</i>I need to know, Jim. I wouldn't
be asking if it wasn't important.<i>You gotta stop this, Robby.</i>Robby, Macleish's assistant said
he's all booked up, he can't see us.Yeah. Well, the hell
he can't.All right.
That'll be fun.You know what,
I'll catch up with you, okay?We're good.Hey, guys,
I'm really sorry, I am,but I don't have any time
to talk right now,but if you call
my assistant...Mr. Macleish,
we have reason to believethat there are allegations against
as many as 87 priests in Boston.I can't talk to you
about that.Does that number sound right to you?
You gotta be kidding me.I just told you I don't have
time for this crap right now.Eric. How many priests
did you settle?Robby, you know
I can't tell you that.You're gonna give me the names
and the names of their victims.Are you threatening me?We've got two stories here.We've got a story
about degenerate clergy,and we've got a story
about a bunch of lawyersturning child abuse
into a cottage industry.Now, which story
do you want us to write?'Cause we're writing
one of them.I already sent you
a list of names.What're you talking about?
To whom?The <i>Globe</i>. Years ago.After the Porter case.
I got plenty of calls.I had 20 priests
in Boston alone,but I couldn't go after them
without the press.So I sent you guys a list of names,
and you buried it.I want those names tomorrow.Check your
goddamn clips, Robby.We didn't find
anything in the clips.Yeah. Big surprise.Richard, do you still
go to mass?<i>No. No, I haven't been
to church for some time now.</i><i>But I still
consider myself a Catholic.</i>How does that work?<i>Well, the church
is an institution, Mike.</i><i>Made of men.</i><i>It's passing.
My faith is in the eternal.</i><i>I try to separate the two.</i>Sounds tricky.
<i>It is.</i><i>Especially since the Church
continues to go after me.</i><i>It takes a toll, Mike.</i><i>They'll try to silence
anyone who speaks out.</i><i>I'm sure they'll come after you
and your team soon enough.</i>Really? And how do you think
they'll do that?Hello?Richard?Who is it?It's the archbishop
of Canterbury.I had dinner at Santarpio's,
had some leftovers.Ah, you're the freakin' best.
Thanks. You want a beer?Yeah.
You got it.Jesus.How much longer you gonna be
in this shithole?Yeah. I'm working on it.She's a good girl, Mike.Yeah, she is.
We'll figure it out.I haven't had
a lot of time lately.I just got off the phone
with Sipe, actually.Have you met this guy
in person yet?No, but his knowledge of this
is on a whole other level.I'm freaking starving.So, where are we
with the 90?We're close.
How close?We're close.
Just answer the question, will you?We got 87 names.We're trying to get confirmation.
I think we will.Something bugging you?It's just surprising,
that's all.Yeah. Yeah, it is.
For everybody.Oh, hey, Ben.
I forgot to ask you.Phil Saviano said he sent a bunch of
info over to the <i>Globe</i> years ago.Do you have any idea to who?No, why?Well, I'm just curious.
I wanted to seeif there's any leads
you guys didn't run out.Saviano was a fucking train
wreck five years ago, Mike.We didn't miss anything.This story needed Spotlight.Yeah, I agree.
I'm just following up.Good night.
Yeah, good night.This is unbelievable.When did you get this?Macleish emailed
the list this morning.He settled cases
against 45 priests.Where are we on Law?Anything that shows he
had knowledge of this?We're still working Garabedian.
But nothing concrete.I keep thinking about that
conversation we had the other nightabout how Law called
down the power of Godwhen we reported on Porter.That's just Law
being Law.Okay, but I checked the clips,and, uh, Porter isn't even
in the Boston archdiocese.- He's from Fall River.
- Sowhy the extreme reaction?Law had to know.That's why he
had the reaction.Because he knew
there were others.I think that's
the bigger story.Bigger than 50 priests?If it came from
the top down, yes.But the numbers
clearly indicatethat there were senior
clergy involved.That's all they do.
Indicate.Are you telling me
that if we run a storywith 50 pedophile
priests in Boston...Mike!We'll get into the same cat
fight you got into on Porter,which made a lot of noise,but changed things
not one bit.We need to focus on the institution,
not the individual priests.Practice and policy.Show me the Church
manipulated the systemso that these guys wouldn't
have to face charges.Show me they put
those same priestsback into parishes,
time and time again.Show me this was systemic,that it came
from the top down.Sounds like we're
going after Law.We're going
after the system.Make a list of all the victims we have.
Start reaching out.And bring Matt in if you need help.
Mmm-hmm.Okay. Hey, when you
go to Springfield?- Our hearing is Monday.
- Okay.Hey, Robby,
you got a second?Yeah.I, uh, got one of those
treatment centersa block from
my house.We got neighbors
with kids.I know that the work we do is
confidential, but I'm feeling like...I should tell 'em.We'll tell 'em soon.You sure?Yeah.
Okay.Hi there. I'm Sacha Pfeiffer.
I'm with <i>The Boston Globe.</i>I was just looking for a gentleman
by the name of Matthew Walsh.Uh...
No, he's not.Yeah, okay. Okay.Hi.
Hi.I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>Yeah, what do you want?I'd like to speak
with Thomas Kennedy.He doesn't live
here anymore.Do you know
where he lives?Sir, I'd just like
to ask a few...Uh, Sacha Pfeiffer,
<i>Boston Globe.</i>Oh, yeah, hi.Hi. Thank you.Anything else
you can recall?No.No, but I got
a cousin in Quincy.She saw him in the street
a few years later.<i>The Bishop came
over to the house.</i>He said nothing like this
had ever happened before,and he asked us
not to press charges.And what did
your mother do?My mother?She put out
freakin' cookies.<i>There was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet.</i>From the Church?Yeah, from
the Church.But not just
the Church.From my friends,from the other
parishioners.<i>Well, many of
the priests that I treated</i><i>were psychosexually stunted,</i><i>on the emotional level
of a 12- or 13-year-old.</i>Jeez.Sure the Chief knew.
Everybody knew,but nobody wants
to cuff a priest.Mmm.And what about
the prosecutor?I shouldn't talk
about this shit.I think you should,
actually.Do you know a Father Hurley
or a Father Gale?I do.I swear to God,
I'll beat the shit out of you.Sorry to bother you.You leave me alone,
you leave my brother alone!You hear me,
God damn it?Hi there.
I'm looking for Ronald Paquin.Yes?You're Father Paquin?Yes, that's right.I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>Okay.Could I ask you
a few questions?Go ahead, dear.We spoke to several men who
you knew when they were boysat St. John the Baptist
in Haverhill.They told us you molested them.
Is that true?Sure I fooled around,
but I never felt gratified myself.Right. Um, but you
admit to molesting boysat St. John the Baptist?Yes, yes,
but as I said,I never got
any pleasure from it.That's important
to understand.Right.Um, but can you
tell me where and howyou fooled around
with these boys?I want to be clear,I never raped anyone.There's a difference.
I should know.How would you know?I was raped.I'm sorry,
who raped you?Ronnie, who're
you talking to?It's okay, Jane.
Father Paquin, who raped you?Who are you?Uh... Sacha Pfeiffer,
from the <i>Globe.</i>Please get off my porch.
I can speak for myself.Get inside the house, Ronnie.
Mr...Get inside, Ronald.
Sorry.Uh, I'm sorry, who are you?I'm his sister,and I don't want
you coming back here.Ms. Paquin...Beat you to
the end of the street!No, you won't.
I beat you last time!No, you didn't,
you cheated!You did!Could you please clarify the <i>Globe's</i>
position for me, Mr. Albano?Yes, Judge Sweeney.Our argument to make
these documents publicrests mainly on
First Amendment grounds.We also have a number
of other relevant arguments.After all, Your Honor,this was a
discretionary order.Yes, it was made
at the Judge's discretion.Hey, Mike.Hey, Joe.What's a
Spotlight reporterdoing in Springfield?Your boy Albano's
sledding uphill.You actually think you have a
shot at winning this thing?You want me to comment
for the <i>Herald?</i><i>"Globe</i> reporter
would not comment,"but he did not
seem hopeful."He didn't try
and hide it at all.He had this really odd
rationalization for it.Like it was
totally normalto fool around
with little boys.I'd really like to go back.
I think he'd talk to us.Oh, we will.Just not yet.I want you to stay focused
on the victims right now.Sacha, where'd they send
Father Talbot again?Um, I think...
Wasn't that Cheverus?Cheverus, that's right.Wait, Father Talbot
from BC High?Yeah, you know him?Yeah, he was there
when I was.We have a victim?Yeah, lives
in Providence.There's nothing personal in
these documents, Your Honor.They concern how the
Cardinal is handling...Say "the archdiocese."Excuse me?You don't get to
tag the Cardinalwith everything,
Mr. Albano.Say "the archdiocese."Judge Sweeney, the <i>Globe</i>
is not a party to this case,they just want
to sell papers.If Mr. Garabedian
had not smearedthe Cardinal's
good name,we wouldn't even be here.Your Honor, I object to the
use of the word "smear."Duly noted,
Mr. Garabedian.Thank you, Your Honor.Anything else,
Mr. Rogers?No, Your Honor.Mr. Albano,
you may continue.<i>The Globe</i>
believes having...Hey, Mitch,
how are you doing?I'm fine.He's tough,
that Wilson Rogers.He's smug.And he's sloppy.He doesn't seem sloppy.You don't know the half of it.
Trust me.What's the
half of it?Tell me the
half of it, Mitch.Off the record?
Off the record, yeah.Three years ago,
I get a call from an ex-priest.Anthony Benzevich.He was at Blessed
Sacrament back in '62,and he saw Geoghantaking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom, okay?So he's appalled,
all right?Tells the bishop
about it.The bishop threatens
to reassign himto South America.Jesus.
Yeah, all right.So fast forward 35 years,Benzevich reads that
Geoghan's been chargedwith molesting
hundreds of kids.All right? So he feels guilty.
He calls me.So you have
testimony of a priesttelling his superiors
about Geoghan in '62?No, I do not.Because when I called Benzevich
in to give a deposition,he comes in
with a lawyer.Wilson Rogers.
Right.And suddenly
Father Benzevichhas a very foggy memory.Can't remember anything.
He's useless.So I go back to work,I forget about it.
Whatever.Until about a year ago,
I find an articleabout a priest who warned
church officials about Geoghan.Benzevich went to the press?
Yeah.Yeah, local paper, <i>Patriot Ledger.</i>
Nobody saw it.But now I got
Benzevich on record.So I file a motion to depose
Benzevich a second time.All right?
And Wilson Rogers,that smug son of a bitch,he files a motion
opposing my motion.And that's when
I have him.Have him how?Rogers opposes my motion,so I have to
make an argumentas to why I'm
allowed to deposeFather Benzevich
a second time, okay?But this time,
I'm allowed to attach exhibits.Do you follow
what I'm saying?The sealed documents?
Yes.I can attach
the sealed documentsthat I've gotten in discovery,
Mr. Rezendes,the same documents that your
paper is currently suing for.You're shitting me?What?
No. No, I'm not shitting you.So I pull out the 14
most damning docsand I attach 'em
to my motion.And they prove
everything. Everything.About the Church,
about the bishops, about Law.And it's all public?Because your motion
to oppose Roger's motionis public.
Yeah, exactly.Now you're
paying attention.So I could just walk into
that courthouse right nowand get those documents?No, you cannot,because the documents
are not there.But you just
said they're public.I know I did,
but this is Boston,and the Church does not
want them to be found.So they are not there.Mitch, are you telling me
that the Catholic Churchremoved legal documents
from that courthouse?Look, I'm not crazy,
I'm not paranoid.I'm experienced.Check the docket.
You'll see.They control everything.Everything.I gotta go back in.These guys got
the fucking documents.Docket entry number 49,
it's in the Geoghan case.We're closing
in 10 minutes.Ten minutes?
All right.- Robby.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>Hey.
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>Garabedian gave me a tip.
Some of the sealed docs are already public.They're part of
a motion he filed.<i>He said they're
the best of the bunch.</i><i>We don't have to wait
for Sweeney's ruling.</i>So we can get them?<i>Yeah, but they're not there.</i>Already talked to Albano.He said all we have
to do is file a motion,and Sweeney will order Mitch
to refile the docs.And you think
these documents are...<i>He said these 14 docs were all we need.
They're huge.</i>Okay. I'll call Ben.
Good work....<i>whether</i>
<i>this was truly an accident</i><i>or someone committed
an intentional act.</i><i>But either way,
extensive damage</i><i>has been done
to this building.</i>What happened?They're saying
it's a prop plane,but that's not
a prop plane.Tell Linda to get every
reporter we have in here now.<i>You pray for the victims,</i><i>you pray for the injured,</i><i>and you pray for
those who survived.</i><i>You pray, too, for the nation.</i><i>That our response to this might reflect
the best ideals of our nation.</i><i>And even more,
reflect God's own teaching.</i><i>Not only as it's shown
in Christianity and Judaism,</i><i>but in Islam as well.</i>Not bad. Who's there?
Paulson.I wanna talk to him
when he's back.Did Rezendes find a way
to get to Florida yet?They just opened the
airport in Providence.He's on his way
there now.Ben, I'm gonna need more
people on Massport.I'll give you
three of my guys.- Robby, put your team on that, too.
- Got it.And Robby,
everything else stops.Understood.Why's Mike going
to Florida?Flight school. It's
where they learned to fly.Robby, I've got a lot of victim
interviews set up this week.We have to cancel 'em.That's gonna be hard.
I know.This is nuts.
Two days ago I told my wifewe gotta be working the
biggest story on the planet.<i>Boston Globe.</i><i>Boston Globe.</i>
One moment, please.Yes, if you have a tip,
I will transfer you down to Metro.Mitchell Garabedian.<i>Mitch, it's Mike,
I've been trying to reach you.</i>I don't have time to talk to you,
Mr. Rezendes.Hey, just quickly,
did you refile those docs yet?<i>No, I just
got the order. It takes time.</i>Okay, great. Can you hold
off on refiling them?<i>Hold off?</i>
I have to go to Florida.Once you refile
they're public.Other newspapers will be
able to get a hold of 'em.<i>Other newspapers are not my concern.
I received a judicial order.</i><i>I told you the Church
is watching me.</i>Oh, hey, Mitch, please.
All I need's a few more weeks.<i>I can't make any promises.
Goodbye.</i>Mitch? Mitch! Shit!Shit.<i>Look, I get it,
no one wants to read</i><i>about kids getting
raped by priests.</i>Especially now.But you asked a lot
of people to relivesome very
painful experiences,and you just disappear.Phil, you know why we were
taken off of the story.It's been six weeks
since 9/11.I realize that and we're
gonna get back to it.When?You're doing the same thing
you guys did last time.No.
You're dropping us.No. Maybe I should tell
the <i>Herald</i> that story.Okay, Phil,
you go ahead and do that.It will undo all the work we've done,
but I can't stop you.Listen to me.
I am here because I care.We're not going away.We're gonna tell this story,
we're gonna tell it right.We just need a little more time.
That's all we're asking for.Why bother asking?You're gonna do
what you want anyway.You always do.Phil.Phil.Hey.<i>How's South Beach?</i>Boynton Beach.
Remarkably different place.What's up?<i>Mitch Garabedian
called me today.</i>Why'd he call you?
<i>'Cause he knew you'd yell at him.</i><i>He refiled the docs.</i>What?Robby, those docs
are public now.<i>We gotta get there
before anyone else does.</i>I know. I know. I know.Just wrap up
whatever you're doingand get
the first flight out.<i>I'll book a flight now and go
straight to the courthouse tomorrow.</i>All right. Call me when you get in.
<i>Okay.</i>Robby, I'd like to let Phil Saviano
know that we're back on it.Good idea.Go have dinner with Hansi.Might be the last time
for a while.Mmm-hmm.Robby, after
we saw Macleish,I started going
back through the clips,and I had a little time
last week finally.So, um, I found that.It's from '93.That it?Yeah. Yeah, that's it.Good night.Okay, good night.So, I was probably a few
years after you, right?No, you were
more than a few.Believe me.Well, after BC High,
I came down to Providenceand played hockey
for the Friars.Oh, well, you must
have been pretty good.No. Rode the bench in college.
Yeah. Oh.But I loved the city.Oh.
And we just had our third kid.And I still get my <i>Globe,</i>
for the record.Oh, that's good to know.
Good to know.Look, Kevin, uh,
that's actually why I'm here.I need to ask you some
questions about Father Talbot.How'd you find out?Well...I guess
it doesn't matter.And I never even
told my wife.Excuse me.Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I need to get in there.We're closed. Come on, let me in.
Five minutes.I'm sorry, we're closed.Come on. Five minutes.Hello.Here.This is the Geoghan case?
That's right.Those records are sealed.
No.That's a public motion.
Those records are public.Look, I work for the <i>Globe.</i>Good for you.Can I talk to
your supervisor?He's not in today.What about a judge?There must be judges that
work on this kind of thing.Sixth floor.We understand the nature of the
allegations against Father Talbot.I'm just not sure what you
want from President Kemeza.Talbot taught here long
before Bill took over.Mmm. Of course.
We just want to knowif it's possible
that the president,the faculty, the board,that no one knew what was
going on at the time.I graduated in 1979, and I had
no idea about any of this.So if you're suggesting that
Father Gibbons and Father Callahanhad in any way...Gibbons and Callahan...I mean, they ran this
place like the navy.Do you really think
they didn't know?It's a big school, Robby.
You know that.And we're talking about
seven alleged victimsover, what, eight years.We're talking about
seven that we know about.This is ridiculous.You're reaching for a story here.
We cannot possibly...Jack. Jack. Jack.
If I had been president then,I would've known.Bill, I'm not sure
that's relevant.Why do you think they sent
Talbot up to Cheverus?You know they
wanted him out of town.Robby, as well
intentioned as Bill's remarks are,I'm hoping we can
keep this between usuntil we all get
on the same page.Is that why we're here,
to get on the same page?No, we're here because you're
an important alumnus, Robby,and a friend.Exactly, and we know you care about
this school as much as we do.Did you play
a sport here, Jack?Yeah. Football. Why?Mmm. I ran track.You know, I went to
Providence yesterdayto talk to one of
Father Talbot's victims.He played hockey here.And, uh, he's one
of the better ones.He's got a wife,
kids, good job.About 10 minutes
into the conversation,the guy breaks down.You know,
couldn't stop crying.Said he could never figure out
why Father Talbot picked him.Father Talbot
coached the hockey team.So,I guess we just got lucky.You and me.Does Jack Dunn
work for the school?No, he's PR
for Boston College.They call him
when they need help.And Pete Conley?
Why was he there?Good question.Pete's a big alum,
but I called Bill directly,and I asked
for a sit-down.I never mentioned
anybody else.It's like everybody
already knows the story.Yeah.Except us.
And we work right there.Judge Volterra?
Yes.Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>Um, I'm having
some troubleaccessing some
public recordsdown in the
records room.I was wondering if I could
have a word with you?All right.
Thank you.Thank you very much.These exhibits you're after,
Mr. Rezendes,they're very
sensitive records.With all due respect,
Your Honor,that's not the question.The records are public.Maybe so, but tell me,where's the editorial
responsibilityin publishing
records of this nature?Well, where's the editorial
responsibility in not publishing them?You can't take those.
You need to make copies.I'm going to the copy room.It closed at 4:00.Look, I'll give you83 bucks to use yours.Hey, cabbie!Hey! Hey! Hey!Take me to <i>The Boston Globe</i>
on Morrissey Boulevard.Don't take 93.
Take Dorchester Avenue.<i>Robby, it's incredible!</i><i>Law knew about Geoghan for years,
no question.</i><i>There's a letter to Law
from a woman Margaret Gallant,</i><i>who lived in Jamaica Plain in the
early '80s when Geoghan was there.</i><i>Listen to this,</i><i>"Our family is
rooted in the Church,</i><i>"our desire is to
protect the Holy Orders,</i><i>"even in the midst
of our agony</i><i>"over the seven boys
in our family</i><i>"who have been violated."</i><i>Seven, Robby. Seven boys.</i><i>"It was suggested
we keep silent.</i><i>"We did not question the authority
of the Church two years ago,</i><i>"but since Father Geoghan
is still in his parish..."</i><i>But she sent it to Law,
and Law did shit.</i><i>Here's another one to Law, same year.
Listen to this,</i><i>"A word on the recent
assignment of Father Geoghan</i><i>"as an associate
at St. Julia's in Weston.</i><i>"Father Geoghan has a history of
homosexual involvement with young boys.</i><i>"I understand his recent
departure from St. Brendan's</i><i>"may be related
to this problem.</i>"I wonder if Father Geoghan should
not be reduced to just weekend work"while receiving
some kind of therapy."You know how grateful I am to
you for your constant concern."Sincerely yours in our Lord,"Most Reverend John M. Darcy,
Auxiliary Bishop of Boston."December 7, 1984."An auxiliary bishop
wrote that?That's incredible.He broke ranks.I mean,
when did Gallant write her letter?1984.
And Law just ignored it.How do you ignore
that freakin' letter?We got 'em.You can't read these letters and
think anything else. It's proof.Yeah. It is.This is good work.Should we
take it up to Ben?Uh...No. Not yet.Why not?
We got Law. This is it.No, this is Law
covering for one priest.There's another
90 out there.Yeah, and we'll print
that story when we get it,but we gotta go with this now.No, I'm not going to
rush this story, Mike.We don't have
a choice, Robby.If we don't rush to print,somebody else is gonna find these
letters and butcher the story.Joe Quimby from the <i>Herald</i>was at the
freakin' courthouse.So we'll write
a holding story,and we'll keep our
eye on the <i>Herald.</i>Keep our eye on the <i>Herald?</i>They run this and they get it wrong,
the Church will bury it.We gotta do this now.
Mike, Mike...What? Why are we hesitating?Baron told us to get Law.
This is Law.Baron told us to
get the system.We need the full scope.That's the only thing
that will put an end to this.Then let's take it up
to Ben, let him decide.We'll take it to Ben
when I say it's time.It's time, Robby. It's time!They knew and they
let it happen. To kids!Okay? It could've been you!
It could've been me!It could have been any of us!We gotta nail these scumbags!We gotta show people that
nobody can get away with this!Not a priest or a Cardinal
or a freaking Pope!You finished?Yeah, I am. This is bullshit.Oh...You okay?Mmm...Hey, Hansi.Hard day at work, Mike?Here.
Thank you.I don't know why
I got so pissed off.You know, I think
Robby's wrong.You know, you're just...You care about the story, Mike.
We all do.- Yeah, I guess.
- Mmm.I stopped going to
church with my Nana.It was...
It was too hard.You know,
I'd be sitting there,and I'd start thinking
about Joe Crowleyor someone else and I just...I just got so angry.Did you tell her why?She goes to church
three times a week, Mike.It really pisses me off.You know,I actually really liked going to
church when I was a little kid.Mmm.Why'd you stop?Typical shit.But the weird thing is,I think I...I think I figured that maybe one day...I would actually go back.I was really...
I was holding on to that.Mmm.I read those letters, and...And something just cracked.It's a shitty feeling.
Yeah.It's a shitty feeling.Looks like a long day.Hey, Pete.
I'm sorry to make it longer.Brian.Has anyone ever said no
to a drink with you, Pete?Well, sure.
But the trick is to keep asking.For Boston.Boston.Mmm.So, you here
for the Cardinal?Oh, no, no, no, no.
I wouldn't...I wouldn't presume to speak
for the Cardinal. No.You know,you got a lot of people here
who respect you, Robby,the work you do.That's good to know.You know, it's because you
care about this place.It's why you do what you do.
It's who you are.You know,
but people need the Church,more than ever right now.You know, you can feel it.And the Cardinal...You know, the Cardinal,
he might not be perfect,but we can't
throw out all the goodhe's doing over
a few bad apples.Now, you know,
I'm bringing this up to youbecause I know this is
Baron's idea, his agenda.I gotta tell ya,
I mean, honest to God,I mean, he doesn't care about
this city the way we do.I mean, how could he?This is how it happens, isn't it, Pete?
What's that?A guy leans on a guy,and suddenly
the whole townjust looks
the other way.Robby. Robby, look it,Marty Baron is just
trying to make his mark.He's gonna be here for a couple
of years, and he's gonna move on.Just like he did in
New York and Miami.Where're you gonna go?Hmm?Good night, Robby.
Brian.Hey, Pete.
Yeah?Uh...When we do run the story, uh, I'm gonna
need a comment from the Cardinal.We'll talk again later.
Good night, Robby.Good night, Pete.Robby.What?No shit. When?Okay. Yeah.Hey!What's up?Sweeney ruled
in our favor.She ruled to unseal
the documents.Jeez!The Church has already
filed an appeal,but the trial court ruling is
generally upheld in these matters.And when would we
get the documents?Probably takes Cohen
a few weeks to rule,then there's
a redaction process.Uh, I'd say they'd be
made public mid-January.Okay.
All right.Thanks, Jon.
You bet.Nice work.
Thanks.Metro should run
something, Marty.We can't run
this one big.Why wouldn't we?
It's a major First Amendment victory.Not to mention,
you getan Irish Catholic judgeruling against the Church?- That's a hell of a precedent.
- Mmm-hmm.We don't want the <i>Herald</i>
going deep on this.Why's that?You're gonna have
to step out, Peter.I'm not stepping out.Peter.When did you, uh...
A couple of weeks ago.A couple of weeks?- Yeah.
- And you're telling us now?These are substantial.They clearly show
that Law was negligent.I need more time.
I wanna keep digging.For what?
This is the goddamn story.It's not
the whole story.Tough shit.
We're on a clock now.Even if we don't
run Sweeney's ruling,another paper could find these
letters and fuck the story.Agreed.But we run
these letters alone,Law apologizes,
says it's a one-time thing.He can bury it.How? These clearly show he
knew and did nothing about it.Look, I'm close to
stories on 70 priests.We nail that,
along with those letters,this is proof
this is bigger than Law.It's the whole system.You have multiple sources
confirming all those priests?On some. I can get more.Too risky. If we're not buttoned
up on every single one of them,the Church will pick us apart.I think I can get us someonefrom the other
side of the aisle.Somebody inside the Church?Yeah, a lawyer.Will he go on the record?Deep background.
But he's a solid source.Rezendes needs time
to write the story.We don't wanna drop it at
Christmas, not after 9/11.We could run it
just after New Year's,before they release
the rest of the documents.All right.Tell Canellos to bury
the ruling in Metro.You got six weeks.Thank you.Tell Mike I want
a draft by Christmas.And we need a response
from Lake Street.Who does PR for the Cardinal?
Still John Walsh?No, somebody new,
Donna Morrisey.She came from TV.
She's young.Good, get a quote.We need something from Law
to appear even-handed.Robby, next time give
me a goddamn heads-up.Will do.<i>Silent night, holy night</i><i>All is calm</i><i>All is bright</i><i>Round yon virgin,
mother and child</i><i>Holy infant,
so tender and mild</i><i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i><i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i><i>Silent night, holy night</i><i>Shepherds quake</i><i>At the sight</i><i>Glory streams
from heaven above</i><i>Heavenly hosts
sing Hallelujah</i>Oh, Robby.
What a nice surprise.Come on in.Hey, hon, look who
I found outside.Karen, can you
give us a minute?Sure.Good to see you, Karen.What's up?I'm out of time, Jim.We've got cover-up
stories on 70 priests,but the boss
isn't gonna run itunless I get confirmation
from your side.Are you out of your mind?Come on.
This is our town, Jimmy.Everybody knew something was going on,
and no one did a thing.We gotta put an end to it.Don't tell me
what I gotta do.Yeah, I helped defend these scumbags,
but that's my job, Robby.I was doing my job!Yeah.You and everyone else.Get out of my house.Hey!You come to my home
and lay this shit on me!You were right, Robby.We all knew somethin'
was going on.So where were you?What took you so long?I don't know, Jim.Give me the list.Larry, we're going
to press in six hours.Donna Morrisey
said she'd called uswith a quote
from Law hours ago.That's what I thought.
When did you talk to her?Okay, okay, Larry.Yeah. Yeah, that's
good to know.Thanks, Pete.
Anything?Conley said Donna Morrisey should have
called, he just left Lake Street.Yeah, Rasky said
the same thing.This is ridiculous. You'd think
they'd wanna get ahead of this.I mean, they'd be
idiots not to.I would love to see their faces
when they read this thing then.You know, Sunday's the
feast of the Epiphany.It seems appropriate.Mike Rezendes.Hey, Donna.
Thanks for calling.Yeah, I just had a few questions
if you have a minute.What?What?
Another adjective.Anything?
Law just turned us down.Jesus Christ.I just got off the phone
with Donna Morrisey.She said, quote,
we don't even want to knowwhat the questions are,
end quote.She really said that?
Yeah.Well, that oughta do it."The Church
had no interest"in knowing what the <i>Globe's</i>
questions would be."Work it in somewhere before the jump.
Anything else?Uh, Matt wants to put
the letters online,so the readers can
see for themselves.We can run the URL at the
bottom of the article.It's pretty straightforward.
Okay.We also put the Spotlight tip
line at the end of the storyso people can call in.Goes directly to our office.Matt and I can go in in the
morning in case we get any calls.Yeah, I'm more concerned about
the phones at reception.After we ran
the Porter case,the message centers
were tied up for weeks.It's a real problem.
There were picketers, too.Lots of 'em.I'll talk to Richard about
the security and the phones.Uh, how are we coming
on the folo story?Well, we've nailed
down multiple storieson 70 priests.- All 70?
- Mmm-hmm.And with the confirmation from
Robby's source, we're ready to go.We can have
a draft next week.Uh, Robby, that
source of yours,is it something
we could revisit?He might be tough.But he has no problem
helping the Churchprotect dozens
of dirty priests.Guy's a scumbag.
He's a lawyer, he's doing his job.He's a shill
for the Church.He knew
and did nothing.He could've said something years ago.
Maybe saved some lives.What about us?What's that
supposed to mean?We had all the pieces.Why didn't we get it sooner?We didn't have
all the pieces.We had Saviano,
we had Barrett, we had Geoghan.We had the directories
in the basement.You know what?
We got it now.Robby, the story
needed Spotlight.Mike, Spotlight's
been around since 1970.So what? We couldn't see the scope of this.
No one could.Robby, this started
with one goddamn priest.Macleish sent us a letter
on 20 priests, years ago.Sacha found the clip.You freaking kidding me?
20 priests?When?Uh, just after Porter.
December '93.We buried the story
in Metro. No folo.That was you.You were Metro.Yeah. That was me.I'd just taken over.
I don't remember it at all.But yeah...Um...Can I say something here?Sometimes it's
easy to forgetthat we spend most of our time
stumbling around in the dark.Suddenly a light
gets turned on,and there's a fair share
of blame to go around.I can't speak to what
happened before I arrived,but, um, all of you have done
some very good reporting here.Reporting that I believe
is gonna have an immediateand considerable
impact on our readers.For me, this kind of story
is why we do this.Having said that, Cardinal Law
and the Catholic communityare gonna have a very
strong response to this.So if you need a moment,you've earned it.But I will need you
back here Monday morningfocused and ready
to do your job.Leaving?Yeah.I, uh, just got a call

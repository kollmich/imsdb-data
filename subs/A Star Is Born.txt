- Cops?Yeah, that's why
they serve all night long.Can I ask you
a personal question?Sure.Do you write songs
or anything?I don't sing my own songs.Thank you.Why?I just don't feel comfortable.Why wouldn't you
feel comfortable?Um...Well, 'cause almost
every single personthat I've come in contact within the music industry
has told methat my nose is too bigand that I won't make it.- Your nose is too big?
- Yeah.Your nose is beautiful.Are you showing me
your nose right now?- Yeah.
- You don't have to show itto me. I've been
looking at it all night.Oh, come on. No, you're not.I'm gonna be thinking about
your nose for a very long- time. I'm not full of shit.
- You're full of shit.- Yeah, you are. Yeah, you're full of shit.
- I'm telling you the truth.- Can I touch your nose?
- Oh, my gosh!Let me just touch it
for a second.You're very lucky.- Oh, really? Yeah, not really.
- Mmm-hmm.My nose has not made me lucky.I could've had
maybe a hit songif it wasn't for my nose.That's fucking bullshit.Yeah. No, it's not bullshitbecause you go
into these rooms,and there's all these
fucking men in there,and they're
just staring at you,listening to your record,
going,"Oh, you sound great,
but you don't look so great."You know, I had a thing
when I was little.I was born with this thing
in my ear, couldn't hear.What do I wind up being?
A singer, so you never know.Look, talent comes everywhere.
Everybody's talented.Bet you fucking everybody
in this bar is talentedin one thing or another,
but having something to sayand the way to say it
so people listen to it,that's a whole other bag.And unless you get out thereand you try to do it,
you'll never know.That's just the truth.If there's one reason
we're supposed to be here,it's to say something
so people wanna hear it.Don't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?Yeah, I do.I don't like it,
but I understand it.Oh, I think
you like it a little bit.I think I'm getting through
a little bit. I can see it.No, you can't.It's a good thing we met.- Yeah.
- For both of us.- Trust me.
- I don't know what is going on.- Honestly, what...
- Who does?I'm in a cop bar, with
Jackson Maine. It's, like...Jackson Maine!I'm gonna wake up in a minute.That's the thing
about when you get famous,people start saying
your full name.- Well, what do you want...
- Just "Jack."Oh, speaking of...Come on.- What?
- Did you put that on?You put that on. When did you
even go to the jukebox?Oh, God!I hear that song, and I just
wanna turn it the fuck off.Jack Maine!I fucked
that fucking song up so bad.- No! What? Come on.
- Oh, my God!Hey, I know that
we're not supposed to do this.I know that we're not supposed
to come and bother you.- You come here every night.
- That's all right.You got your camera on you?
'Cause I don't have my camera.Excuse me, one sec.My ex-girlfriend was
fucking this guy.- Right. Okay.
- Who looks like you,- that's what she said.
- Shut the hell up.But I gotta take
a picture of youbecause I gotta send it to herbecause I'm gonna show her
that you looknothing fucking like
that fucking guy.Jack, I'm sorry.Maybe that'll help her out.Will that help you out?
Will that make you happy?Why don't we take
the fucking picture?You want someone
to take the picture?- Hey, no, no. It's okay.
- Excuse me.You want someone
to take the picture?- Get the fuck off, you little whore.
- What? What?- Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah.
- What?- I'm sorry! No, Jack!
- I got you.- It's all right.
- Oh, my God!- No, no, it's all right.
- Why did I...I'm fine, honestly. I'm okay.
This is so stupid.No, you gotta get ahead
of the swelling.Just try to find some...This is so embarrassing.Here we go.
Yeah, put that on there.Gotta wrap something up
with it. Find it.- You like Cheetos?
- No, like gauze.- Some gauze or something.
- Gauze?Try to do that.
With that hand.And do that hand.You play piano?Yeah, we gotta
take care of this, then.Oh, okay. Thanks.And that's it, yeah. No, but
keep that on there, hold on.Can you do that? Yeah.
Did you get it?It's already gotten warm,
hasn't it?- Should we have gotten two?
- It's okay. No, it's okay.Thanks.I'm sorry. I had to.That's all right.It's not really all right,
though.Have a good one.Be careful, she'll hit you.These rings
are gonna get stuckif you don't take them off.- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.- That's okay, though.
- May I?Yeah.Safekeeping.- Put this on there.
- You're a sweetheart.And we'll just wrap it up.You'll be good to go.How the hell do you deal
with that all the time?- What's that?
- People justtalking to you
like you're not a real person- or taking your picture.
- Is that too tight?It's okay, thanks.- Oh. I hurt you.
- That's fine, it's okay. Ow...There we go.
Now, you're mobile.Swing it around.I look like a pirate.Right? I told you
it was worth coming here.How do you do that?- Do what?
- Don't change the subject.Is that what I'm doing?Nobody ever asked you
about you, huh?- Not sure.
- Where are you from?Arizona.- Arizona boy.
- Mmm-hmm.Dad had a midlife crisis,
I think.So I've been told.Made his way to Arizona,
started workingfor this family
on a pecan ranch.- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.Knocked up
the family's daughter.She was just shy of 18.Uh-oh.That's when
I came into the picture.Okay.
The son of an 18-year-old.Yeah.Well, she died at childbirth.- Then, my dad...
- I'm sorry.He, uh...He died when I was 13,so I guess my brother would
tell you that he raised me,but I don't know. I don't know
who was raising who.Just 127 acres of nuts,
Navajo, and nowhere to go.<i>âª Tell me something, boy</i><i>âª Aren't you tired,
trying to fill that void</i><i>âª Or do you need more</i><i>âª Ain't it hard,
keeping it so hardcore âª</i>Is that me?That's you.- Did you just write that now?
- Yeah.It's pretty good.<i>âª I'm falling</i><i>âª In all the good times
I find myself</i><i>âª Longing for change âª</i>I started writing this song
the other day,and maybe that could work,
like as a chorus or something.I have to think
if I can remember it. Uh...<i>âª I'm off the deep end</i><i>âª Watch as I dive in</i><i>âª I never meet the ground</i><i>âª Crash through the surface</i><i>âª Where they can't hurt us</i><i>âª We're far from
the shallow now âª</i>Holy shit.What is this?Was this supposed to help me?Can I tell you a secret?I think
you might be a songwriter.But don't worry,
I won't tell anybody.But I'm not very good
at keeping secrets.You're a real gentleman.I think.Thank you, sir.
It's right here, on the right.- Right there?
- Which one?- This one.
- Oh, yeah.What's all this?Oh, it's my dad.
It's a long story.What's he, a sheikh?No, he's a driver.Hey, I got a gig.
You wanna come?When?We're headed
to the airport now.- Tonight.
- Tonight? No, I can't.I gotta go to work later.
I gotta go to bed.Who's gonna take care of your
hand? I messed it up, or...- Me.
- No, no!- I'll take care of my hand.
- It's my fault.- I took you to that place.
- That's okay.No, listen. Hey!- You have my number.
- Okay. All right.Hey.What?I just wanted to take
another look at you.Oh, maybe I fucked that up.No.- Hi, Dad.
- Pretty late, pretty late.- Oh, is it late?
- Yeah.Look at you, you don't even
know where you're walking.- Come on.
- Well, I wanna go to bed.No, come in for two minutes.It's Wolfie's birthday,
come on!- Two minutes!
- Okay.- Wolfie!
- Yeah, sweetheart?Who was the guy in the car?I don't know
what you're talking about.- Hey, Ally.
- How's it goin'?- Happy birthday.
- Hey, "happy birthday"?- Yeah.
- It's not my birthday.What do you mean?- Come on.
- No, I was just saying...What the hell happened
in here? My God!This place is a mess!Starting gate
is Shipazo Gitoand bad beat is Wario Peito.What's going on?
You leave the butter out.Who the hell's
betting on horses- at breakfast time in Japan?
- It's not- breakfast time in Japan.
- They're loading!- Joe, we're going. Come on!
- You guys are crazy!Have a sizable
investment on this thing here.What did I say about smoking
in this house?- Outside!
- Who are you?Who am I?
It's my house.I know it's your house.
But you smoke too.- All right, forget it.
- Okay, good.Sweetheart, you're happy here,
aren't you?I'm happy, Dad.I'm just saying,
she's got no space.- What are you saying?
- Wait a minute, sweetheart.- I'm saying she's got no space.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.I want my friends
to look at you.Take a good look.With a voice like from heaven,
but you know what?It's not always the best
singers that make it.You know?
I knew a couple of guyscould sing Sinatra
under the table.But Frank, he'd come on stage
with the blue eyes,the sharkskin suit,
the patent leather shoes...He becomes Frank Sinatra.And everybody else,
all these other guysthat really got it,
that really have it inside,just a bunch of nobodies.Okay. Everybody, let's go.Time for work.Unfortunately,
you keep blasting the hearing,it's not gonna come back.I think it's time
we reconsider- the inner monitors.
- Mmm-hmm.We've talked about
that with Bobby- a couple of weeks ago.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.If we put the inner moles in,
we can actually use thoseto amplify the high
frequencies.- Yeah, okay, that sounds great.
- Cut down the sound.- Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
- I'm gonna talk to Bobby,and we're gonna
get something set up.Sold. I'm sold.- All right, Jack.
- Yeah, call Bobby.Stubborn son of a bitch.<i>All right, let's get
ready. 1, 2, 3, 4.</i><i>âª Killing me, baby,
with the things you do</i><i>âª You put me in the ground âª</i><i>We're trying...</i>You gotta put 'em in, man.I told you,
I can't wear those things.When I wear 'em,
it's just in my head,and I need to be here
with everybody else.The doctor said
it's the only wayto manage this thing, Jack.You're not gonna
get back what you lost.It's the only way we can
manage what you still got.Oh, wow.I think
we're managing pretty good.What do you
want me to do?<i>The door's wide open
if you wanna go.</i>You know what?
Don't start that shit.Show a little fucking pride
in what you're doing, buddy.I just wanna know if she's
on her way or not, that's all.Who's coming?What the fuck?- Who's here?
- I have no idea.He won't tell me.- Hi, Ally.
- Hi.- I'm Phil. We met last night.
- Yeah, I remember.Jack sent me to pick you up
and take you to the gig.Oh, my God. Um...But I gotta work. I can't go.He's really
looking forward to this.I really appreciate that,
but, uh...I can't leave,
so I'll be in my carright down the street.Please tell him,
"Thank you, but no thank you."Okay? Say it just like that.Wait a minute, Ally.
What're you doing?The fuck is that shit?- This is crazy.
- What are you doing?- This is great.
- What the hell's going on?Look, a guy like that
invites you to a show...- It could be a great opportunity.
- Dad, don't start with me.- Don't start!
- Listen, listen!Does he know you sing at all?
Did he hear anything from you?Dad, I gotta go to work.This could be
the opportunity of a lifetime.I don't have the same diseasethat you have, Dad.
You get around celebrities,and it's like
they're gonna rub off on you.What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?"Oh, you know who I drove
the other day?"Why are you talking
about that?Like magic, now you're famous.And you're not.
It's not magic, Dad.Sweetheart.He's a drunk!
You know all about drunks.Sweetheart, he's still there.Yo, so you fucking hit a cop?Yeah, he was being
an asshole to Jack,so I fucking popped him
in the face.Yo, that is so gangster.So, then we ended up
in a parking lot,and he was putting peas
around my hand to fix my hand.And then he was singing,
and I was singing.I don't know
what the hell's going on.But now he's got his driver
following me around.Wait, he's been following youfrom your house
all the way to work?- Yes! It's crazy!
- You're fucking late again.I'm what?I said you're late!Are we doing this?Hey, Bryan, I'm out.Find somebody else.Bryan, I'll be back.
I promise.- <i>Papo,</i> I promise.
- See ya. I won't.- Did you see Bryan's face?
- Oh, shit!Hey, great!
Let's do this.Let's go.What are we doing?You know,
if I didn't know Jack,I would call you a stalker.Yeah, sorry about that.Yes, man!Lay on that couch right now!
I'm gonna take my shoes off.- Oh, my God!
- This is nice.How this shit works?- They just told you no.
- Oh, okay. I'm so sorry.Oh, shit!I could get used to this shit.You need to date

just stick with it.No, I can't do that.
I'm sorry. No, Jack, please.Yeah, you're coming.
Here we go.It's not funny.
Jack, don't fuck around.All you gotta do is trust me.That's all you gotta do.I'm gonna

I set it in the wrong key,and then the tempo
was too fast.No, it was
so beautiful, and...I wasn't sure...- Ally, you okay?
- Jack?Jack?You, you, move!Isn't that the girl who sang?Good concert, man!
Good concert.Thank you, yeah. Thank you.- Jackson, I love you, man.
- Thank you.Hey, Jack. Killed it.- Really?
- Yeah.Hi!Oh, my God!Where's my key?
I don't fucking...Ah, ha, ha, ha!Oh, fuck!I'll be right back, okay?
Just give me one second.Is this the bathroom?
Where's the fucking...Okay.Hey.Jack?I don't know, wake him up.I can't wake him up.
He's drunk.Yes, you can!Shake your titties in his faceor some shit,
and just fucking...You know what I'm saying?
Take two shots and...Thank you so much for your help.
You are so helpful.Let me know how it goes, baby.Go home, pal.He's out.You think maybe
he drinks a bit much?Sweetie, you have no idea.Tell you one thing, though.He's never brought a girl
onstage before.And it's been
a long, long timesince he played like that.Well, that's good to know.One time,
my brother came home,I was playing on this uprightwe used to
always have in our den.And I was in my own world.No one was ever home,
and then he comes hometo take care of my dad,
who was sick.And he's sittin' there,
and he's looking at me.I swear to God,
he looked at melike I was special
or something,and it just kind
of filled me up.I should've never
told you that. I don't know.Why?'Cause it's embarrassing.
I don't know.It's so sweet.'Cause you're nothing like
my brother, let me just say.Yeah, I don't look
like your brother?He's a fucking
old man, okay.My dad had me
when he was 63 years old.63 years old?And we have
different mothers, so...What's that number down here?That is how many people
looked at it.Get the fuck out of here.How do they know
how many people looked at it?I think it's... They call it
an algorithm, or...What's an algorithm?It's like a beat.- A beat?
- Yeah. Yeah.- Like in music, a beat?
- Yeah.Yeah, yeah.
I think, I don't know.- Do you believe this?
- No.- Wow.
- And you see this?- Yeah.
- That's how many people have watched.Yeah, yeah,
we're just telling...They was telling him.How the fuck do they do that?I've watched it
200 times myself.- I'm 200 of those people.
- Go, Pops.Oh, jeez!
My God, you're so fast! Jack!French toast is
gonna come out.First one to hit the bed.<i>âª I like for you
to let me sing along</i><i>âª Give you a rhythm you feel âª</i><i>Beautiful,
you wrote this with him?</i>He's so talented.- Can I watch it again?
- Yeah, it's good.- Just one more time.
- One more time.- I'll be up all night watching this.
- Or 500. Come on!Christ!<i>âª I want to play the part
to reach your heart</i><i>âª Sing you a song
that you feel</i><i>âª Oh</i><i>âª Love let your music
be mine...</i>Oh, my God.How did you get in here?Dad let me in.<i>âª Let your melodies
fly in my direction</i><i>âª Take me to your paradise</i><i>âª On a musical ride</i><i>âª I'm in love
with your music baby</i>What?<i>âª You're music to my eyes âª</i><i>I don't feel
this way about everybody.</i>Well, good.Then we're on the same page.
You come and sing with me.Where?Well, first stop's Arizona.I'm never getting on that thing
with you when you've been drinking.I haven't even thought about
drinking or anything else.We'll see how long that lasts.
Go wait downstairs.Actually, when I was
in my 20's and 30's,I was like a crooner.As a matter of fact,
a lot of people thought I wasbetter than Sinatra.Frank? Frank Sinatra?What are you
writing down in here?That's my songbook.
I usually use a typewriter,but I had this idea
on the bikeand I didn't wanna forget it.How do you hear it?<i>âª I'm alone in my house âª</i>Aren't you excited to be homeand play for
all your Arizonian fans?I don't really come back here.You avoid your home?I don't know.It's like the hot airand the history, I don't know.Bought the ranch, though,
I grew up on,gave it to my brother.We buried Dad there, and so
I just wanted to make surethat nobody paved
over his grave- or any of that kind of shit.
- Is it around here?It's not far.Why don't we just go there?
It's nearby.Jack?Yeah, if he shows up.These guys have been
vamping out therefor a fucking half an hour.It's time to fucking get on.Don't you
get tired of being...You sold Dad's ranch.They turned it into
a fucking wind farm!I bought that for you.Where's his grave?He washed away
in a fucking storm.His grave isn't there anymore.I told you,
but you were fucking drunk.You were fucking loadedand already pissing yourself
a swan song.Fuck if you shed a tear
for that piece of shityou idolize for
no goddamn fucking reason.All Dad ever did for youwas make you
his fucking drinking buddy.And you'd be right there with
him if he was still alive,and you fucking know it.What did you think,that I was gonna fucking
take care of itwhile I'm fucking
cradling your assall over the goddamn world.Yeah.That's a good excuse.Raising a little brother,so you don't have
to deal with the factthat you were no fucking good.If I was no good, why'd
you steal my fucking voice?Huh?'Cause you had
nothing to fucking say.You were too proud to sing
any of the songs I ever wrote.Well, I got something
to say now, pal.I'm done being
your fucking errand boy.I quit.Yeah, my voice
just got up on mea few months ago andanother shot of steroids
is better safe than sorry.Thank you for that,
and yeah, we should be good.Hey.You okay?Yeah.Well, let's play.Uh...Oh!<i>âª Don't ask me 'bout tomorrow</i><i>âª Or tell me 'bout my past</i><i>âª My heart is yours to borrow

you were fucking doing it.I was there, I fucking...- I think our car's over there.
- Ally, that was unbelievable.- Thank you.
- That was unbelievable- what you did up there.
- Thank you.I don't know
if you know anythingabout me,
about where I've come from.I'm Rez Gavron.I know who you are.What you have right now
goes way beyond just this.There's people
who need to hearwhat you have
to say musically.This is not normal stuff.It's really amazing
what you're doing.I think you have it all. I do.And the question to you is,
"What do you want?"I'm in that position, to put
you wherever you want to be.I don't... I don't have...I gotta talk to Jack.He said
he thought Interscope Recordsmight really wanna sign me,and he said that he has
this wonderful studiowith a beautiful live room.And these amazing producers
he wants to bring into record my songs.And he loves
"Look What I've Found."Remember the song
we did in the diner?Remember,
when we were driving?Yeah.Yeah?I mean, it was so nice
talking to him,and he really believes in me.- You all right, Jack?
- He's okay. He's fine.He does this all the time.Hey, Jack.Thanks.What's going on?Hmm?What're you doing?You jealous fuck.I'm so happy for you.Oh, you are?Oh! Jackson!Oh, my God!Jack. Stop!Why're you so jealous,
boy? Hmm?What're you doing?What's wrong? You upset?You want me to
make you less...I know, do you wanna play?
Okay, let's play.What the hell is this?- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- <i>No, you're fine. You're all fine.</i><i>- You sound great, okay?
- You're doing great.</i><i>We'll do it again.
I'm gonna cue you in.</i>- One, two...
- <i>âª I'm alone in my house âª</i>One second, one second.
Listen to my cue.We'll come right in, okay?<i>So, should...
Well, uh...</i><i>I'm sorry, but will I
sing in the beginning?</i>So you're gonna
hear the second line,and then I wanna
start recording.I think I got an idea that
might help out, all right?Yeah, please. Be my guest.That was really good
up to that point.- I'm just gonna go in there for a second, all right?
- All right, Jack.I've never sang
with a track before.I think it's because
you need your piano.I think if you're playing it
and singing it...Yeah, I always play it
on the piano. I'll be fine.I'm just gonna have them fly
one in, and we'll try it there- and see where it goes.
- You think that's okay?Okay. Thank you.I got you.
You're doing great.- You okay?
- No, I'm so nervous.- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.Thank you.<i>âª I'm alone in my house</i><i>âª I'm out on the town</i><i>âª I'm at the bottom
of the bottle</i><i>âª I've been knocking 'em down</i><i>âª I can't get back up

met the new girl, have you?- Rez! What's the plan?
- What's up?Yo, thanks for doing this,
man. I appreciate it.This is pop music, kids.
We have a battle to do, okay?You are the troops,
so if I call you troops,just know that
we're going into battle.What is my lyrics, Ally?<i>âª Just don't keep me waiting</i>Yes! Again, give me that.<i>âª When I can't inspire myself</i>- Breathe! Yes!
- <i>âª I need you to provide for me âª</i>This is just fine-tuning
and creating an image.I know,
I just don't wanna losethe part of me
that's talented.I'm not gonna let you
lose that piece.I'm not gonna let you
lose that piece.Okay.What are we gonna do with you?What are we gonna do with...
Oh, he's beautiful!"You can't send me back.
I'm too cute."- Hey, he's got your eyelashes.
- Mmm-hmm.He does. He's got
your eyelashes. Hey, bud!This has never been done
before, just so you know.It actually has
been done before.Would you please...Please. Do it for me.No, I can't in the water.You comin' with me to Memphis?- What are you talkin' about?
- I gotta go do this, um...You know,
it's one of those paid things.Soul-crushing work, really,but it's just kind of neverwhat I thought
I'd wind up doing, maybe.I don't know, but...I've made peace with it,
though.Anyway, if you wanna come,
I thoughtwe'd have a laugh,
at the very least.Rez wants to
keep me here because,you know,
they rushed out the single,and they were so excitedthat they want me to
finish the album.- So I'm working on that.
- Listen to what you're saying.Listen to what you just said.People wanna hear
what you have to say.- That's the stuff right there.
- I know. I can't...Hey, hey. Take it in.Thank you, by the way.Thank you for what?Giving me a home.This place never
felt like one before.Oh, fuck.Jack, you okay?Jack?<i>âª Treat me like your patient</i><i>âª Just don't keep me waiting</i><i>âª Or I'll just be wasted
in a crowd of the lonely</i><i>âª I need you to inspire me</i><i>âª When I can't inspire myself</i><i>âª I need you to provide for me</i>Is there a reason

- Did Jack show up?I haven't heard from him.What do you mean,
you haven't heard from him?I haven't heard
from him all night.I haven't been able to find him.
I called him three times.Listen, what happened
with the dancers there?Well, I just thought
that I should do it alone'cause it's so overwhelming.Okay, but you can't
go rogue on me.You have to understand
that this is what I do,and you have to
trust me, okay?So, if I give you
a couple of dancers,don't not use them and then
miss a couple of steps, okay?We also have to
change your hair.We have to
change the color of your hair.What's wrong with my hair?I'm thinking platinum, or...I don't wanna be
fucking blond.I am who I am,
and I'm worried about Jack.I will find Jack, okay?I will find him.Jack.I feel like
we've done this before.Didn't think
we'd do it so soon, man.Come on, bro. Get up.All right. There we go.<i>In my mind,
I made it to the door.</i><i>I almost didn't wake you.</i><i>You looked so comfortable.</i>How you doin'?You know, I've seen
better days, I guess.I apologize for
disrespecting your property...No apologies necessary....or whatever I did.- It's fine.
- You want some coffee?Be great,
why don't you put some on,and we'll come in in a minute?Okay.That's him, right?
That's your boy.Jack, he's as old nowas you were when I met you.Saw you on YouTube.- That video with the girl.
- Yeah.It made me happy, man.You looked like you.
You were just...Just doing it, bro.She writes too.- She wrote that tune?
- Yeah.Bunch of others too.Got hooked up with some
manager guy, wants to...Yeah.- She's good, bro.
- I know.Maybe she's a way out.Ain't nothing to
be afraid of, bro.You know, it's like...I don't know...
You float out...Float out at sea, and then
one day, you find a port.Say, "I'm gonna stay here
for a few days."A few days
becomes a few years.And then you forgot where you
were goin' in the first place.And then you realize,
you don't reallygive a shit about
where you was going'cause you like
where you're at.That's how it is for me.I like where I'm at.I didn't even realize
I liked it so muchtill I saw your ass sleeping
in the grass this morning.Yeah, come on, man.You can rest
in my daughter's room, bro.I thought of a million things
to say to you on the planethat I can't remember.Jack...Glad you're here.You did make it
to Memphis after all.Fuck.I won't do this again.I won't come and find you.Next time, you can clean up
your own mess.You understand me?How was the show?It was fucking awesome.I cut the dancers.Dancers?Yeah.Oh.Good.Fucking dancers.All you do is you just sing.You made me so upset.I'm sorry.- I saw that video on YouTube.
- Oh!It was great.Thank you so much.Excuse me one second.- What's going on?
- Do you have a plier?Jack's okay?I wanna cut the guitar
strings, not too crazy.There used to be pliers
or something like that.Uh... Yeah, yeah.I don't know
where my mom is.- Yeah. I understand that.
- I think you're pretty.Me?You think I'm pretty?Thank you.
I think you're pretty.It was real great,
and thenJack tells me
you wrote the song.Yeah,
he got me to start singingmy own songs again.He has a way of doing that.Yeah, he does.Does anyone want some
more mac and cheese?Yeah? Here, sweetheart,
you want some?Oh, there he goes.
What's up, man?I understand what you said.What the hell are you...Are you kidding?- That stupid?
- No. It's not stupid.It wasn't a stupid thing
I just did?Is that what you were doing
when you left the table?I don't know. He told me he
was looking for some pliers.I didn't know
what he was going to do.I didn't think
he was gonna "do it" do it.Oh, she has another ring!Well, that's just temporary.No, no, no.
Jack, wait a minute.Let's anoint this.
Let's do it today.- Yo, for real.
- It's a good idea!No, you get the dress.I'll call my cousin right now.It's Saturday.
Nobody's gonna be in there.- Let's go.
- You really wanna do that?That place has
a magical quality to it.It what?
It has a magical quality?- It does.
- What do you mean?- I mean that church is special.
- We can go.- I'll take you to get a dress.
- There you go, right there.It'd be great!
Okay, you're comingwith us for sure
because you're...I can't believe this.
What am I doing? Okay, sure.<i>âª I don't know
what love is... âª</i>- My brother. Good to see you.
- Hey, hey!- Good to see you. Jack!
- Good to see you, my man.Thank you so much.Welcome to the Lord's house.With the power...I think that's how it goes,
something like that.Do you take him...
Do you take him?I do.I do.<i>âª I think that it's just fear</i><i>âª I don't know the tempo... âª</i>Congrats, man.- I listened to what you said.
- I'm glad you did.I can't believe he did it.I can't believe it.Now, one thing at a time,
okay?What?Oh!
I didn't understand.<i>âª It's not</i><i>âª I know there's something
real out there for me</i><i>âª I swear I've seen an angel âª</i>- Lot of people downstairs?
- Yeah.She better come out soon,- before they leave.
- Want me to check on her?Well, I think we're gonna have
to go pretty soon, so...All right.Ally.I'm coming in.What're you doin' in the tub?This is so weird.I don't know
who the hell I think I am.One song is fine,but to put out a whole record,I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.I don't know
about all of that,but you definitely
look like a star.- Really?
- Yeah.What do you think of her hair
and the look and the...- Well, I discussed it with her.
- Yeah.- No, I think it looks great.
- Was that your choice, or...No, it was actually hers.- No drink?
- What's that?No drink?No socks?Touche. Touche, mate.Yeah, I could never
get used to that,the idea of not wearing socks.Your feet get all...No, actually
I'm wearing socks.They're these kind of
little female insert socksthat work with these shoes.Oh, you are.
You're just hiding them.Yeah, I'm just hiding them.
That's right.<i>Okay, now is this thing...
Yeah, there it is.</i><i>Oh, that's a good light.

What about my song?I fucking listened to it over
and over in the fucking...You're not making any sense.Yeah, just keep drinking.That'll give you the answer.Maybe I just fucking
failed you.- That just kills me. I'm sorry.
- You what?You failed me?Yeah, you're embarrassing,
and it's just...- I'm embarrassing?
- I feel bad for you.- Yeah, I just... You know...
- I'm not fucking embarrassing!- I just have to tell you.
- You're embarrassing!And you know
what you're doing isyou're so embarrassed
of your fucking selfthat you gotta put me down.You're worried that you're ugly, and
you're not. I'm trying to tell you that.So you need to
get all this fucking approvalby all these other people.Why can't I just
be enough for you?I don't need approval.You know what I'd like is
for my boyfriend to love me.Actually, for my husband
to love me.Yeah, who's
your fucking boyfriend?- You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, I've got a boyfriend.- That hurts.
- Yeah, I have a boyfriend.Call me
your fucking boyfriend.You're my boyfriend.You're my boyfriend if you
don't treat me like your wife.I don't even know
what that fucking means.It means clean your shit up.
You're fucking messy.- That's what it means.
- Well, that's not true.- Oh, it isn't?
- Mmm-mmm.Let's go. You wanna
be my drinking buddy?Wanna practice?I don't think
you could handle it.You don't? Let me see.And you know why? 'Cause
you're too worried about what- everybody else is thinking.
- Here we go.Here we go, Jack.
You want me to be your dad?- Be your drinking buddy?
- Yeah.Yeah, you couldn't be my dad
if you fucking tried.He had more talent
in his fucking fingerthan you have in
your whole fucking body.So don't even fucking go there
about that, all right?That's over the fucking line.Why don't you
have another drink,and we can just
get fucking drunkuntil we fucking
disappear, okay?Hey! Do you got those pills
in your pocket?You're just fucking ugly,
that's all.- I'm what?
- You're just fucking ugly.Get the fuck out.Get out!I said, get out!Fine.<i>Good evening.</i>Down!7 and 8 and...2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...Pull it!6... Come on, feel it...Hit! Down, up! High! Swing it!Six... Come on! Yes!<i>âª Tryin' to leave you</i><i>âª But you won't let me leave,
sayin' that about me</i><i>âª Got me thinkin'
I'll never succeed</i>Hold the music!- That was great.
- What are you doin' here?Something fell through,
so I was ableto come back a few days early.I think I might
have said some things...Just how I acted.You hurt me.You really hurt me.Sorry.You haven't been drinking.What'd you say?I said you haven't been
drinking. I can tell.No, I haven't. No.I have to get back
to rehearsal...Oh, yeah.Can I watch?Yeah, okay.Meet me at home.Or I can wait
and drive you home.- Just meet me at home.
- Okay.What do you mean,
they don't want me to sing?They hired this fucking kid
at the last minute.They didn't tell me
a fucking thing.Look, we've been
on that other side before.More than once.Yeah.Truth is, I didn't deliver.Well, it's a good thing
I know the, uh...How to play the
guitar. It's fine, I'll do it.- You're gonna do it?
- Sure.<i>âª I couldn't help but see</i><i>âª Pretty woman</i>Hey, where's the wedges?
Can't fucking hear with the...- Is the monitor here?

it's a real honor.Yeah. Oh, honor's mine.Yeah, you're great.
It'll be fun.- Yeah, hope so.
- Yeah.Who coulda been a crooner?Right?You remember what Paul said."Paul Anka told me
I had more natural talent...- "...than Sinatra."
- "...than Frank."- That's it! Do not...
- Direct quote!Do you know what Paul
Anka actually said to him?- No, what did he say?
- He said,"Would you please
pull the car over"and let me out
over here on the curb?"All right, but...
Oh, my God!Sweetheart.This is unreal.The Grammys.Hey, look at everybody.
How are you?Hey, there he is!- Oh, thanks.
- How are you?Are you okay?- What's that?
- Are you okay?Are you okay?- Oh, yeah, I'm great.
- Are you sure?Yeah, I'm great.They have me going in early,
so I gotta go now and then...But I made sure that they
tell me where you're sitting,so that I can go right after.- Okay. Okay.
- 'Cause I don't wanna missthe awards
because it's right before it.- Looks great.
- You just got that look on your face.I do? Watch... It's gone.Amazing. Gonna get to see

incredible collection of vinylyou have in there.Take whatever you want.

- Shit.Look.<i>If I haven't thanked you

- <i>Good night.</i>- I think I peed myself.
- Baby, just turn around.Oh!- I think I do...
- Baby, baby, can you...- I think that's a bad come down.
- Holy shit!- Just take him to the shower. Go to the left.
- Follow me, Wolf.Ally, you just go
inside, okay?- It's on the left, Dad.
- I got it.- Go inside!
- They got him,- they got him. They got him!
- It's my job!Don't you fucking
do this to my daughter.Hey, hey!What the fuck is
wrong with you?Get off!Damn it!
Watch his fucking head.What, what?Bobby'll take you there.You have Bobby's number?No, Jack, hon,
you gotta sit up.I don't want you to choke,
baby. Sit up!All right,
I might've taken too much.You all right in there?I'm fine.He's fine.So,
everybody has their journal,and we remember
the homework assignment,the three things that
I wanted you to write down.Jack, hey.I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.You can't be late, Jack.Understood, sorry.Good, where's your journal?- It's in my room.
- No, no, no.Sit down.So, it's all agreed. Nobody's
ever late here, right?Okay. Good.Anything you wanna tell us?Um...I'm grateful to...To be hereand trying to
hold it together.I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic.Jack.Drug addict.This is all my fault.You don't have
that kind of power, Dad.Eat your dinner.
Eat your food.I don't even know
what meal it is.Go and have some fruit.How many times did you carry
my piano up the stairs?How many times did you sit
there while I wrote a song?- Always.
- Okay, it's okay. It's okay.You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.You're just the greatest
person in the world.<i>How long have you
been here now?</i><i>Two months.</i>Can it be fixed?Well, you would know that,
don't you?Once it's gone, it's gone.I don't know what you have.Oh, well, the tinnitus,
they say, once you...- Oh, tinnitus can't be fixed.
- Right.Well, I just hear that tone,
that's all.The tone, yeah.The ringing.I have hearing aids on,
as you...No, I know.
That's why I asked you.You know, I'm convinced thatit happened when I
was younger, I used to...My dad had a Victrola,
an old record player.My head was just about the
size of it when I was a kid,and I used to love to just
put my whole head in there.He was big into
the blues, so...'Cause you gotta figure, it's
just me and him all day long.My brother's out there tryin'
to make something of himself.So I took one of his belts.I put it around
the ceiling fanand tried to do the deed.The whole fucking fan
came out of the ceiling.Had a big cut
on my fucking forehead.I was more mad about that
than it not working.And he didn't even notice.He didn't even fucking notice.- 'Cause he was drunk?
- Yeah.That fucking fan stayed on the
floor for about half a year.How old were you then?I was just shy of 13.Aww!You smell good.You smell good,
and you look good too.Swimming. I've been swimming.- You've been swimming?
- Yeah, there's a pool.- I love that you're swimming.
- Yeah.- That's a great pool there.
- Yeah.How's Charlie?Oh, Charlie's sweet.He just sort of sits
by the door like this.Waiting for daddy.We're both waiting for daddy.What, three weeks?You are gonna
come back, right?What do you mean?You gonna come home
when you're done?- Do you not want me to?
- No, I want you to.I'm just wondering if...
I just...- Where else would I go?
- I don't know.I guess I just thought...
You know, it's like...- There's Jack...
- Wait, wait, wait.- Why would you say that?
- I don't know. I guess...I wondered, without the booze,if you would want
to come home.'Cause when you met me,
you were drinking,and now you're not.I wasn't drunk the whole time
we were together.I know, but...But it got bad
when we were together.It's okay. I mean, it's fine.I just was wondering,
that's all,and whatever you want is okay.Whatever I want?
I wanna be with you.- That's why I'm here.
- Okay, I know, I know.I just want you to be happy.I'm working on that.I need to stick with you.I brought something.I wanna knowwhat this is."My Love."You hiding love songs?No, I wouldn't...I wouldn't say
I was hiding it. I just...I started puttin' it
down to paperwhen we were at home.I don't know, it just
sort of fell out of me,I guess, and onto this page.And I put it in here,
and I thought...I thought
maybe you'd find itwhen you came
back to you, maybe.Well, I found it.Listen.I'm, uh...I'm sorry.It's okay.I...It's okay.
It's not your fault.I'm sorry I did that.It's okay.It's not your fault.
It's a disease.No, but I embarrassed you.- I embarrassed you, and I...
- I'm not embarrassed of you.It was so wrong.And then your dad...My father loves you,
it's okay.I know, but I...- It's okay.
- I know, but I...It's okay.It's okay.<i>I have figured out
what I think is</i>the best solution
for both of us.Jack should come out
on tour with me.We'll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be ableto play by himself.You realize
that's not an option.He's so inside of his art
in a way he has never been.- He can hear himself again.
- Ally, there is no waythat you can take Jack on tour
with you. There is no way.Do you understand
what I'm saying?You know what? If you can't
make that happen,then fucking cancel the tour.
I don't know what to tell you.I think if we had
a better band name,we might've made it.Or maybe it was 'causewe looked like
a father and son duo.Not many of those around.I was not a good look for you,
that's for sure.Not my fault I couldn't find
a better guitar playerin the whole goddamn state.Where in the fuck is it?Right here.Thanks for the ride.Sure thing, Jack.Hey, you know, uh...
When I, um...When I said I would...
You know, when I...Took your voice, you know.It's you
I idolized. It wasn't Dad.What was that guy?Hey.Hey.I wanna know
how you hear this.That sounded unbelievable,
what you were playing.- Thank you.
- It's nice to hear it.Thank you, and I hadthe beautiful backdrop
of you and Charlie.I only heard it in my mind forso many weeks,
so it's good to hear it...The words are beautiful.In the real thing.
In the real thing.- Well, you want me to do that?
- Mmm-hmm.Oh, God, I don't know.
I knew you were gonna ask me.Back from the dead.Hey, sorry.
Were you waiting long?Hey, Jack. No, no.Uh... Ally's not home.No, I told her I'd meet her
here, if that's okay.Of course, yeah.Here you go.Hey, thanks for taking care of
my girl when I was gone.Anything for her.She told me about
that European leg.That's a hell
of an accomplishmentthis soon out of the gate.Shit, I remember
it was like ten yearsbefore I even went
across the pond.It was summer, 2004.Shit, was it?We're not exactly
friends here.While you've been away,we've been back here
in serious triage,trying to clean up
your fucking mess.Barely finding
our way through it.You almost single-handedly
derailed her whole career.You understand that?She's never gonna
say this to you.She loves you too much.Just by staying married to
you, she looks like a joke.It's embarrassing.Let's be honest, we both know
it's only a matter of timebefore that's pushed aside
again for the real thing.And when that happens,I don't want her
anywhere near you.Hey.I have some good news.- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.I'm not gonna go to Europe.We're gonna cancel
the rest of the tour,and I'm just gonna
be here all summer.Isn't that great?What happened?Nothing happened.The label just
loves the record,and it's doing so well,and they wanna keep
with the momentumand have me make another one.Rez is super psyched,
so it'll be great.So tonight's
gonna be my last show.Going out with
a bang at the Forum.Great.Yeah.Why don't you come with me?We can sing "Shallow"
together.The fans will go crazy
to see you.Come on, cowboy.Yeah, why not? Okay.Yeah?Okay, good.I'll have a car come get you.Once I get there.I'll go meet you there.I'll see you soon, okay?Hey.What?I just wanted to take
another look at you.Bye, honey.Bye.Come here, Charlie.Come here.Thank you so much for
bringing us all here together.Please look over all of the
dancers tonight and the band.And my husband, Jackson.We're so excited for him
to be here with us.We got a big night.We're at the Forum. LA.
Let's do this.<i>âª Why did you do that? âª</i>Is he here?He's not here.He's not here?We have to do "Shallow"
regardless, okay?The guitar's up there.Everything's gonna
remain the same, okay?- What?
- The guitar's up there.Everything's gonna
remain the same.Both verses.I'm sure it was just a bit
much for him, that's all.Please send somebody
to the house, please.I'm doing it right now.I have 15 seconds.<i>âª In the shallow</i><i>âª In the shallow</i><i>âª In the shallow</i><i>âª We're far from

Jackson.</i>I can stay, if you want.Some kid started
singing one of his songsin a bar I was
in the other night.They're playing
his songs everywhere.At first I got angry.I don't know why.I guess I felt like,how can any of these people
feel like they knew him?Who he really was.But then something changed.And it soothed me.That it wasn't
all for fucking nothing.The last thing
I did was lie to him.Listen to me.It isn't your fault.It just isn't.You know whose fault it was?Jack.That's it.No one else.Not you, not me.No one but Jack.I just keepgoing over and over it,
over it in my head.Jack talked about how music isessentially 12 notes
between any octave.12 notes
and the octave repeats.It's the same story.Told over and over.Forever.All any artist
can offer the worldis how they see
those 12 notes.That's it.<i>He loved how you see them.</i><i>He just kept saying,</i><i>"I love how she sees them,

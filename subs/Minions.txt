"Minions 2015" ^ (Run time : 01:30:58)minionsMinionsMinions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.They go by many names.Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.Oh, that one is Norbert.He's an idiot.They're all different.
But they all share the same goal.To serve the most despicable
master they could find.BOSS!- Boss.
- Boss.Making their master happy was
the tribe's very reason for existence.But that's not to say that
they didnât have other passions.- Hey, look. It's a banana.
- Move over.Hey, I know. It's a banana.
Ha-hah-ha.Yum yum.
Huh?Finding a Boss was easy.But keeping a Boss...
therein lies the rub.Ow.Ow.
Owww.Whoa!Oh.- Oop.
- Aw.- Oh.
- Oh.I am... oaf.
Aw.Nope,
it wasn't easy for these guys.But they never gave up.With the emergence of the stone age
came the rise of a new species.Man was very different
from the dinosaur.He was shorter, hairier
and way, way smarter.The minions took an instant liking to Man
and helped him as best they could.Oh, no no...
Here. A present.- This?
- Yes yes yes.For hitting.
Ut-ut.Aw!Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile, so-so delicious.Their quest for a boss put
the minions front and centerfor some of the civilization
most historic moments.Ancient Egypt held great promise.Okay!But it didn't last long.Hmm.
Oh.Here.
Yup.Ow!The dark ages
were actually fun times.Their new master had a tendency
to party all night and sleep all day.Ahem.
Yoo-hoo.<font color="#ff9b9b">[Happy Birthday]
357</font>Oh.But eventually
the party was over.Achoo.They bounced from
one evil master to another.But they never seemed
to find their perfect fit.One particular employer took
their failure very very badly.Huh?The Minions had no other
choice but to keep moving.Oh.
Look.And then,
when all hopes seem lost.They found sanctuary.The Minions were safe.Years passed as the Minions
forged their own civilization.They truly made a life
for themselves.But something just wasn't right.They felt empty inside.
Without a master, they had no purpose.They became aimlessand depressed.If this continue any longer,
the Minions would perish.But all was not lost,
for one Minion had a plan.His name was Kevin.He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.He'd been preparing for
days, weeks, months.But now he was ready.Buddies.Kevin would leave the cave,
go back to the outside worldand he would not return
until he had found his tribethe biggest baddest villain deserved.But he needed help.Me! Me!
I will come.Bob was eager to go.
- Kevin?But Kevin felt he was just not strong enough
for the dangerous journey ahead.Uh no.
One other Minion?Me.
Choose me.Me! Choose me!
Aw.Me!I will come.Luckily someone stepped up.- Huh?
- Stuart! Come here.Huh. Me? Me?
Oh, thank you.Truth be told. Stuart had no idea
what he was chose for.Huh!
Wh-Why?But was thrilled that made
people cheered for him.Uh.
Stuart, Stuart.One more?ME!
I am strong.See here.See!- Oh.
- Oh.Uh... okay.
One more.Kevin.
Choose me.Please.
Choose me, Kevin.Come here.Huh.
Yeah! Ha ha.Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasmbut mostly lack of other volunteers
changed Kevin's mind.- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya!Kumbaya.Big boss!
Big boss!The tribe said their farewells.Kevin had given them something
they haven't had  in a long time.- Hope.
- Kevin!- Bob!
- (Big boss! Big boss!)Hey,Tony.
Good luck to you.Tom.
Take care.And Chris.
See you later.- Hey Bob, you coming?
- Yes, yes.Big boss!
Big boss!Bye bye.Kevin felt pride.He was going to be the
one to save his tribe.Stuart felt,
hungry mostly.He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.- And Bob
- Oh.Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.Okay. Okay.
Look for the big boss.Ah. There you go, Bob.
Come on.And they were off.Off,
to find their new boss.Come on, Bob.Huh?
Kevin?Oh.- Hungry?
- Food?There is no food.Huh.
Banana.Uh.
Stuart, What it it?Banana.- Banana!
- Aww.- Stuart.
- Food.Stop!Bob!

encountered a big bad wolf,who had a wonderful
surprise for them,The wolf offered the 3 piggies and
all their friends a job working for her.Everyone would be so happy!All the 3 little piggies had to do
was just steal one little crown.That the beautiful wolf
had wanted ever sinceshe was a penniless
little street cub.Unloved and abandoned.But that crown would mean
she was a princess.And everybody loves the princess.So, the wolf sent the
piggies to get that crown.But the little piggies weren't
up to the challenge.They failed their mission.So the wolf huffed and puffedand she blew them off
 the face of the earth!Yo, po, po!The end.Good luck getting the crown

that I shall keep my mouth shut.But, seriously,
we are all in big trouble.- Scarlet
- Ms. Overkill.I don't have time

- Hey.Oh, I've got a groovy idea.Look at this.
Ah-ha-ha.Hello, will the future King,
Herb Overkill,please come upstairs to
prepare for the coronation.Well, I hope you learn
your lesson for today.And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time.I don't even know
anyone named Blerb.I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England.I know,
it's a gas.- I will finally get my crown.
- Yeah.It's all I ever wanted.I'm going to be so happy.But, let me ask you
something, Fabrice.Does that, look like
this to you?Mrs. Overkill.The hair in that picture,
it's just 2 wavy lines.Oh. So what now,
you're an art critic?I drew that when
I was 5 years old.Get out of my sight.Bye, Fabrice!I liked him,
he was fun.So, what do you think
of the dress?Oh, it's so beautiful,so fashion forward,
so Valentino.Gave it a sweetheart neckline
because you're my sweetheart.The high collar and cinched waist
reflect a simpler more violent time.The material is a blend of taffetaand high density body armor.Fully armed and loaded.And they glow.
That's nuclear.Nice.
Just one more thing to do.Got to look good

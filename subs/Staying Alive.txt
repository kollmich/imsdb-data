a musical of some sort.l would consider
doing a print ad.lf you're looking for the outdoor type,
l'm good at some sports,like weightlifting and stickballand push-ups, and...lf absolutely necessary, l don't mind
doing any kind of extra work.Except l promised my mother
l'd never do any nudity.l guess she's afraid
that l might get a cold.But the fact still is,
l'm a dancer by nature.Whatever.Yeah, whatever.lt's like you're invisible.They make you feel
like you're wasting your time.What's really weird is that
they all sound like my father used to.Why be down on yourself?
You know what you can do.- What about you?
- What about me?You've been doing choruses
for six years.Don't you want to do something
that's all you?- lf it happens, good. lf not, too bad.
- How could you think that way?A woman's dancing career
is half as long as a man's.So l have half as many chances
as you of making it.- l've got to be real with myself.
- l don't know, l guess so.Mm...cherry.- See you later.
- Will you come tonight?- lt's the last show.
- l don't think l can make it.- Why the excuses?
- What excuses?Don't play this competition thing
with me.Just because you're in a show
and l'm not, that ain't competition.- Well, what is it?
- Envy!Will you be there?Got any messages?lt's an inside joke.- Tony!
- Hey, Jackie! You were great!- Are you sure?
- l'm positive. You was fantastic.- l was nervous knowing you were here.
- You shouldn't have been.- Are you sure l was OK?
- You were great.- l'll change. Will you wait?
- Yeah.- l'll meet you outside.
- Sure, why not?Hi.Yes?l wanted to tell you
l think you're an incredible dancer.Thank you very much.l'm a friend of Jackie Coll's.
Tony Manero.- lt's important to have friends.
- l was saying that over breakfast.Did you want something?
An autograph, or something?l'd like to get together and talk
some time. Would that be possible?- About what?
- About how incredible you are.- Thank you, but l already know that.
- Say what?l already know.l used to be incredible myself
when l lived in Brooklyn.- Really? What happened?
- l moved to Manhattan.So, where exactly are you imported
from? The vicinity of England?- Very good.
- See? l know.- So what do you do?
- l'm sort of into telling the future.- Great things will happen for you.
- Oh, really? What great things?You're going to meet this really,
really sensitive, nice type of guy.Once you get to know him,
you're going to be crazy about him.- l am?
- Yeah!So where is he?l'll go get him. You just wait here.
You'll love him. He's great.Hey, Rico! She's waiting to see you.
Really! Come on, she's great!Really! No, l'll get him.l got her here. She's nice.
No problem. You'll love her.Come on...
Wait! Well, come on.- lt didn't happen.
- lmported, indeed!- How are you doing?
- Strong draught in there, huh?- Come in.
- You nearly broke my face with the door.l'm giving you my best come-ons
and you try to mangle my face.- Well, Jimmy, you see...
- Tony!Whatever.You seem to take pleasure in treating
women as though we're incredibly stupid.lf you're mad at me, l apologise.
l thought l was being charming.You did try to damage my head.
But the thing is that l...l amazingly respect your dancing
talent. And your womanhood.l didn't always respect womanhood,
but since l moved to Manhattan,l got this new, mature outlook. l don't
smoke, l don't drink, l don't curse.Anyway, l would like to take you out.Maybe we could have a drink,
maybe have some dinner. And...But someplace informal, because
my suits are all being pressed.Well, thank you
but l have to go home early tonight.- We're auditioning for the new show.
- Are you in it?- Definitely. Are you a dancer?
- Yeah, couldn't you tell?Oh, of course.
Why don't you come by tomorrow?- l could put in a good word for you.
- No, don't do that. Please.l really don't need any help
in that department.- OK.
- Are you sure you can't go out tonight?Sorry.Well, if l don't see you any more,nice meeting you
and being insulted by you.My pleasure.- Aren't you coming tomorrow?
- l knew you wanted to see me again.Taxi!- Want to eat?
- l got to get to the club.- Why do you work at that club?
- Extra money.- There's an audition tomorrow.
- l told you a week ago.- Really?
- Yeah. You'll audition, won't you?Why not?
Rejection's a hobby now.Oh, listen to you!Small world, isn't it?
Goodnight.- Goodnight.
- ''Small world...'' Do you know her?- Just informally.
- How did you meet her?She was passing.
l said she was an OK dancer.You told her she's OK!- Something to that effect.
- She's a great dancer!- Whose is the limo?
- l think it belongs to her.- She comes from money.
- Really?ls she heavily involved
with someone?What do you mean?Has she got a lot of guys
drooling over her?l don't want to hear
if you're hot over somebody.- l just respect her dancing.
- Yeah...Did you hear the way she talks?
lt's so intelligent. l love it.An accent doesn't make you intelligent.
lf it did, you'd be Einstein.Jackie, l'm not trying to make
you jealous. You're a good dancer.- What can l say?
- Don't play these games.- What games?
- l'll see you tomorrow.Come on, l don't even know her!Are you sure you don't want
something to eat?Manero, you've got a way with words!Very good. Excellent!Just in case you've got to hear it
again, it's whoever's right for the show.Michelle, Tracy...Smitty...Karen, yes... Sorry.Jackie, you worked real hard.
Yes.- OK, that's it. Next group!
- OK, men please!- Hi, l'm Joy.
- l'm happiness.l bet you are.
l'm the assistant choreographer.Any questions regarding the routine,
please ask me now.Listen up! This time, try the whole
combination right through to the end.lf l don't see you again,
you got beautiful legs.- So do you.
- Listen up!lf you've finished dancing,
move off stage!You're always causing trouble.
Get out of here!OK, now get ready.
Joy, count it down.OK, music!That's good.
That's enough, thank you.We need pictures, rÃ©sumÃ©s,
phone numbers.We'll get back to you.
You were all excellent,but l only need two.
Thank you.Hello, Jimmy.- lt's Tony!
- Oh, whatever.- l know what you must be thinking.
- Do you?They'll call. Don't worry.Whatever.- You were very good.
- Thank you.- l mean it.
- Really?- Yeah.
- Sounds like you appreciated me.Yes, you could say that.- Could l ask you something?
- What?lf you appreciate me
and l appreciate you,how about getting together
and we could appreciate each other?- Appreciate?
- Yeah, like for many hours.l have a singing lesson
l'll have to cancel.That's all right. l got a dance class
l'd have to cancel.And then l'd have to cancel
my manicure.l'd have to cancel
my meeting with the mayor.And then l'd have to cancel

problem, which is easy to overcomeif you forget that you're dancers
working for a couple of bucks.You're translators of body language.
That's all dancing is: body language.So don't waste my time
going through the motions of emotions.You gotta feel
what the hell you're doing.The show's called ''Satan's Alley''.lt's a journey through hell.
lt ends with an ascent to heaven.lt's simple, but if it's gonna work,
you've gotta bust your asses!- l didn't say anything.
- But l... Shoot me. Shoot me twice.- lt's all right, really.
- l got hung up. What can l say?You don't have to say anything.When you say that,
l know you want me to say something.- OK, what do you want to talk about?
- l don't know. What about you?lt's the lovers, the young lovers.- l gotta get going.
- l'll give you a call later, all right?l'll call you later.lf you're really her friend,

you bring some guy home with you.- Are you talking to me?
- What we did meant nothing to you?- lt was nice.
- Nice, everyday! Like breakfast?l usually skip breakfast.
Look, l'll see you later.- l'm talking to you!
- l said later.- Come here!
- Take your bloody hands off me!Do you think l'm some little groupie?We met, l liked you, we made it.
What do you think it was? True love?You think l used you!
What about you using me?Everybody uses everybody, don't they?Hold it, hold it!- What's this?
- l thought we decided to go downstage.True, but then l changed it
to the upstage position.lt was better going downstage.- Was it?
- Much better.You learn the goddamn
routine the way l laid it out!- Again.
- And...five, six, seven, eight.- What if l come over about nine?
- How do l know you'll show?- Come on!

- l wanted to ask you a favour.- What favour?
- Could you meet me here tonight?- No, l don't think l can.
- l will owe you for life if you do.l know l treat you bad
and l got terrible manners.But so did the people l grew up with.
Some of it rubs off.There's a gentleman inside here
dying to get out. Really.Come on, would you?Please. How about it?- OK.
- Thank you.You're welcome.- l didn't think you were showing up.
- l'm sorry. The show ran late.- Tony, you remember Carl. Carl, Tony.
- How are you doing?- l need to ask you something.
- Me, too.That guy's a musician. l didn't think
you was the musician type.- He plays rhythm guitar at the club.
- Rhythm guitar? That's the worst!Everybody knows you can't trust a guy
who plays rhythm guitar.Oh, l can't believe... !Underneath them curls is a pervert.
l can feel it.Did you take funny pills today?- How did you get in here?
- The window.- You amaze me.
- l don't like him.- Looks like a demented paratrooper.
- He is just a friend!- Listen, thanks, Carl.
- ls everything all right?- Fine. She's in good hands.
- Are you Allstate, pal?- Yeah, you want disability?
- l'll see you Wednesday.- All right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.Did you see
how you said goodnight to him?Oh, great! No, how did l say it?lt was like syrup.
l got a cavity just listening to it.What are we doing here?l wanna...
l wanna try Butler's routine.l wanna ask Jesse
to have a shot at replacing him.- You're kidding?
- No. You think l can do it?- l think so.
- Well...do you want to help me?- l think so.
- Let's go.- l think you're a little jealous.

Subtitles by explosiveskullOkay. My turn, my turn.
Um, I got one.Great, but can you make ita little more challenging
this time?Okay. Check this out.I spy with my little eye...something yellow...and round,
and it eats dots.Seriously, Ralph?Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.Well, obviously,
it's Pac-Man.No, that's not...Why is that obvious?Name one other thing
in this whole arcadethat is yellow and round
and eats dots.I can name two things.Ms. Pac-Man
and Baby Pac-Man.Boom!
I accept your apology.Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?Yeah, you got me.Knew it.
All right, riddle me this...do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.I don't know.I mean, if the fur
were confined to his chest,I might agree...but look at those
two very specifictuffets of shin hair...poking out of his boots.That does not just happen,
Ralph. That is a choice.You're totally right, kid.He's baby smooth
everywhere else.I rest my case.My mind is blown!Let's go get a root beer.Okay, let's see
what you got, kid.Ooh!Nice one. Okay.I think I got one
in the chamber.Ew!- Gross.
- Thank you.Hey, wanna sneak into <i>Tron?</i>Doesn't that game
have a virus?No. I'm sure
they fixed it.Whoo!I'm gonna beat
my speed record!Hey, wait for me!Ralph.Yeah?I don't think
they fixed the game.Uh... No.Help!Hey, Tron!Tronny!Tronny boy!Help!Do you realizewe're basically just, like,
zeroes and ones...floating around the universe
like tiny specks of dust?Like, doesn't the very natureof our existence
make you wonder...if there's more to life
than this?Why would I wonder
if there's more to lifewhen the life
I got is perfect?I mean, sure. Doesn't
look so hot on paper.<i>I'm just a bad guy
from some old video game</i><i>who wrecks a building.</i><i>And yeah, for 27 years,</i><i>I was a total zero
without any friends.</i>But now,
I got a best friend...who just happens to bethe coolest kid
in the whole arcade.Aw, thanks, pal.Watch this.Home run!All right, let's go
watch the sunrise.Are you really sayingthere's not one single,
solitary thing...about your life
that you would change?Well, think about it.You and me get to
goof off all night long.Litwak shows up, we go to
work, we put in our hours.Then the arcade closesand we get to do it
all over again.The only thing I might do
different in that scenario...would be not having
to go to work.Other than that,
I wouldn't change a thing.Huh?Hey, where'd our sunrise go?All right,
let's get you plugged in.That's a plug-in alert.Litwak hasn't plugged in
a new game in forever.- Let's go see what it is!
- Yeah!Excuse us. Excuse us.
Minor emergency.Hey, Felix, Calhoun,
what's getting plugged in?Well, Ralph, Sonic thinksit's gonna be
a new pinball machine.What do you think,
lady love?I'll bet you a shiny nickel
it's a blood pressure machine.- Kids love those things.
- Ooh.Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.Please be a racing game."Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?Well, it's either wiffle ball,
or an arranged marriage game.It's actually pronounced
"Wi-Fi," Ralph.Yeah, that's what I said.And Wi-Fi is the Internet...which is an online communitywhere human beings
go to shop...and play games and socialize.Ooh, fun!Oh, no, it is not.That sign right there
says "Wi-Fi."What it should say
is "Die-Fi."That's a little humor there.But seriously, the Internet
is nothing to laugh at.It is new, it is different,and therefore
we should fear it.So keep out, for Pete's sake,
and get to work.The arcade's about to open.Figures, we finally get
something new plugged in...and we're not even allowed
to go in there.Totally not fair.A new racing game
would've been cool.Something wrong
with your game?No, no.It's just every bonus level's
been unlocked.I know every shortcut.Man, I'd kill for even
just a new track.New track? You already got,
like, three choices.Yeah, I know,
but don't you ever wishsomething new
and different...would happen in your game?Nope.Really? Well,
agree to disagree.Wait, I don't wanna disagree.No, no. It's just
a fancy way to saywe don't have to
argue about it.We're arguing?
I don't wanna argue.Relax. Stop making it
a thing.Go to work. I'll see you
tonight, stench vessel.All right.She wants a new track,
I'll give her a new track.Come on, Nafisa!
Let's play <i>Sugar Rush!</i>Pick Vanellope, Swati.She's got
the best superpower.Yeah, the glitch. I love her.<i>Drivers,</i><i>start your engines.</i>You're gonna lose today,
Princess.While, yes, I am technically
a princess, Taffyta...I'd rather you just think of
me as plain old Vanellope...the racer who's about to
kick your butt.<i>Three, two, one, go!</i>And pardon me, excuse me,
coming through.Whoo-hoo!Whoo!And one, two, three gumballs
right on cue.Yeah, I love it
when she glitches.Ooh! Huh.Excuse me.
I must have fallen asleep.Oh, fun. I'm winning.<i>Vanellope takes a huge lead.</i><i>No one's gonna catch her now.</i>She's gonna love this.Right on time.What?"Looking for something new..."and different?"Then take this track."Oh, Ralph,
you old son-of-a-gun.I'd say I got a little time
for a detour.Whoa!Hey, look, I think
I unlocked a new track.Never seen that before.This is awesome!Hey, thanks, Ralph!You're welcome!Get back up
on the track, Swati.You're going to lose.I can't.
It's like it's driving itself.Whoo!What is wrong with
this thing?What?No, no!Kid!Oh, no, no, no, no, no!Kid! Kid!Oh, kid, I'm so sorry,
are you okay?Oh, my gosh.What an amazing track!Thank you, Ralph! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!You're welcome!You know I take my duty
as your hero very seriously.Wait a minute.You took a serious
doody where?Vanellope, get up here.We have a situation.Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope
racer wasn't working...and I think maybe I
turned the wheel too hard.- Whoa.
- I'm real sorry.It's okay, Swati.I think I can get it back
on there pretty easy.- What did you do, Ralph?
- Nothing.Leave him alone.He was just trying to
make the game more exciting.Yeah, why don't you relax,
Taffyta? Litwak will fix it.All right, on you...Oh!Okay. Still not a problem.He'll just order a new part.Well, I'd order a new part...but the company
that made <i>Sugar Rush</i>went out of business
years ago.I can try to find one
on the Internet.- Good idea.
- Oh, me too.Good luck, that'll be like
finding a needle in a...I found one! On ebay!Really? How about that?See? Those kids
have it under control.They're just gonna get
another wheel from the eboy.Are you
kidding me? How much?That's more than this game
makes in a year.Aw, I hate to say it,but my salvage guy
is coming on Friday...and it might be time to sell
<i>Sugar Rush</i> for parts.- Aww.
- Where's he going?Litwak's gonna
unplug the game.Get out of here!
Go, scram, let's go, run!Go, run, run,
run, run!- Let's go!
- Run!Gangway!Yeah,
you heard him, gangway!Stop it! No running!What are you people doing
out of your game,for Peter's sake?The arcade is open!<i>Sugar Rush</i>
is getting unplugged.- We're homeless!
- Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!Oh, what are we going to do?Y'all, calm down, calm down.
Get a hold of yourselves.I don't want to be gameless.An unplugging.
Good Lord.I haven't seen
this many gameless characterssince <i>Space Invaders</i>
went down.Um...Where are we gonna live?Well, you can stay here until
the arcade closes, I guess...and then we'll figure outwhere the heck
we're gonna put you all.Okay.Here we go.I raided Gene's fridge.Good news, he's got pie.Took a bunch of his pillows
and junk, too.I'm thinking we make a fort
up here, or like a yurt.Or we could take
these pillows...If we stack them right,we can make an igloo
out of pillows.Like a pillow igloo.
Pigloo. Pigloo!So what do you think, kid?Fort, yurt, or the obvious
best choice, pigloo?I can't believe I don't have
a game anymore.I mean, like, what am I
gonna do all day?What? Come on,
are you kidding?You sleep in,
you do no work,then you go to Tapper's
with me every night.I've literally
just described paradise.But I loved my game.Oh, come on.You were just bellyaching
about the tracksbeing too easy.No, that doesn't mean
I didn't love it.Yeah, sure,
it was kind of predictable...but still I never really knew
what might happen in a race.And it's that,
it's that feeling,that not-knowing-what's-
coming-next feeling.That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.And if I'm not a racer,
Ralph...what am I?Well, you're my best friend.That's not enough.Hey.No, I just...I'm sorry,
I know I'm being weird.I think maybe I just need
to be alone right now.Oh.Okay.I'll meet you over at Tapper's
in a little while, I guess.If you want.<i>All right, now...</i><i>we found some good homes</i><i>for so many of our chums</i>
<i>from</i> Sugar Rush...and we're just hoping
a few more of youwill open your doors...and your hearts
to those in need.Well, I suppose
that large green olivewill fit in nicely
with my decor.I'm a sour ball.Well, beggars can't be
choosers, can they?Come along, condiment.Mm-kay.Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.We're, like, adorable.You sure are.So, any takers?Um...Anyone?Felix, I know
we've never once talked abouthaving a family before, but...I know, it feels
like the kind of thingyou just jump into
with both feet...and nary a plan.Felix and I will
give them sanctuary.Can I get a quick word
with you two?Look, I get it.You've been married
six years,you're looking to
spice things up...but trust me,
adopting 15 childrenis the wrong kind of spice.Those things
are basically feral.Pardon me, sir, but those
youngsters are lambs.Lost little lambs in need of
two kind, caring shepherds.That's right.Besides, how hard
can parenting be?You treat the child
like your best friend...you give them
everything they want...and you just love
their little socks off.Right, Tammy?Darn-tootin'.Huh?Come and get it.Get your own candle.Hey, Mom,
why does your lame TVonly have one channel?Well,
hate to say I told ya...Ow!Hey, Tapper?No, Ralph.
I haven't seen Vanellope.Not since the last time
you asked me 30 seconds ago.Sorry. I'm just
worried about her.She's glitching like crazy,
and acting super insecure.Oh. And get this,
she said...being friends with me
wasn't enough for her.Not enough?
I'm a great friend!Right, Tapper? Right?I'm sorry.
Who's acting insecure?Ralph, come on.The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.There you are... Oh.Hey, Ralph.Hey, Felix. Since when
do you drink root beer?Since tonight.Yeah, I hear you, buddy.Hey, listen. This one was
supposed to be for Vanellope.I guess you can have it.Doesn't look like
she's coming.Thanks.You know,
I can't help but thinkthis whole mess
is somehow...partially my fault.It figures. Just when
my life was perfect.Mine was, too.But, hey,
now I'm a father of 15.Isn't that just a blessing?Eeeee-oh-boy!Wait. What'd
you say, Felix?Um, isn't that
just a blessing?No, the weird sound thing.Oh. Eeeee-oh-boy?Yeah. Eee-oh...Sorry, say it again?- Eeeee-oh-boy.
- Eeeee-oh-boy!- Eee-oh-boy!
- Eee-boy! Say it again?- Eeeee-oh-boy!
- Eeeee-oh-boy.- Eeeee-oh-boy...
- eboy! eboy! eboy!- eboy? eboy?
- eboy.Yeah.Um, what are you getting
at there, Ralph?That kid out in the arcadesaid there was
a steering wheel part...on the Internet, it's
something called eboy or...ebay! That's it,
it was ebay!Ralph, are you thinking aboutgoing to the Internet
and finding that part?Getting that part's
the only thingthat's gonna fix the game
and that's the only thingthat's gonna make
Vanellope happy again.And if <i>Sugar Rush</i> is fixed,all those lovable scamps
living in my house...and destroying my sanitywill have homes
of their own again!Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!I will cover for you.Thanks, pal.Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.Oh, Felix is gonna
cover for me.Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.Shoryuken!Eeeee-oh-boy.Boo!Ralph, what is wrong
with you?Start churning butterand put on your church
shoes, little sister...'cause we're about to
blast off!What are you
even talking about?Oh, we're going to
the Internet.What?Yeah, to find the part
to fix your game.No way!Yeah, I probably
should've just said,"We're going to the Internet."
We're going to the Internet!Yeah, we are!Hey, Surge,
are we glad to see you.We want to report
some malfeasanceover by the <i>Whac-A-Mole.</i>Yeah, we saw
some undesirablescausing a real donnybrook
over there.Oh, heck no.
Not on my watch.Appreciate the tip.So, all we gotta do
is find this eboy place.- Ebay.
- Right, ebay.So we go there,
get the steering wheel...we have it delivered
to Litwak before Friday.He'll fix your game.Everything goes back
to the way it was.Boom! Happily ever after.This is a shockingly sound,well-thought-out idea
for you, Ralph.No offense.I know. And none taken.Ooh, here it comes.Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...I give you the Internet!Huh.The Internet is
not nearly as impressiveas how Sonic described it.Yeah, I gotta admit,
I'm underwhelmed.Where do you think
they keep their ebay?Beats me.Hello, anybody here?Anyone? Hello!We're looking for ebay!Ooh. Did you hear that, kid?
Sweet echo.Check this out.Hoolie-hoo!

let's follow him!Hey, wait for me!
Kid, come back! Wait!Hey!
Don't leave without me!<i>IP address 415-1037-483.</i>Vanellope!I can't breathe.
I don't fit.Whoo-hoo!Yeah! Whoo!Kid!Ralph! Isn't this great?No, it is not!Whoo-hoo!No, no, no.Whoa!Sweet mother
of monkey milk!Whoa!Kid, I don't think
we're in Litwak's anymore.We most certainly
are not, friendo.We are in the Internet!
Come on, Ralph!Holy cow!Look at all this stuff.Whoa.This is the most beautiful
miracle I've ever seen.But it's so big.It goes on
forever and ever.How are we

<i>Wizard Quest,</i> three dollars.""Foxhole hammer,<i>"Zombie Crusades,</i>

Mr. Spamley?Um, you're saying if we findthe Golden Cleatsfrom <i>Pro League Soccer...</i>we find those and bring them
back here to you...then a human being in the
real world will pay us $15?Yes, ma'am.Welcome to the exciting world
of loot hunting.Folks go into games...they harvest
the most coveted items...and they sell them
on my websiteto the highest bidder.
Ha-ha?Okay, but here's the thing...we need like
a buttload of money.So, do you have any more
lucrative items, maybe?Gord!Gord!Oh, there you are.Thank you, buddy.
You're such a nice guy.Is $40,000 lucrative
enough for you?- Whoa!
- Whoa.It's more than enough.I got a guy
in Des Moines, Iowa...who will pay 40 grand
for Shank's car...from a game
called <i>Slaughter Race.</i>A racing game?That's right. <i>Slaughter Race</i>
is the most popularonline racing game
out there.However,
it is wicked dangerous.We ain't afraid of danger.This kid's the best racer
in the whole world.We'll get you that car,
no problemo.Slaughter Race!
<i>Enter at your own risk.</i>Okay, this game
is kind of amazing.Meh, the attention to detail
is pretty impressive.I don't think
I've ever been in a gamewith smog before.- Nice kitty. Nice kitty.
- Easy, boy. Easy.Let's just find Shank's car
and get outta here.Agreed.- Look. Look.
- Whoa!There it is.That car is gorgeous.No wonder it's worth so much.Aw, sugar.- Players. They beat us to it.
- Aw.<i>31 hours
of continuous gameplay...</i><i>and we've finally
found Shank's car.</i>Let's jack this ride.Oh, yeah, DirtySocks,
it's on.Jim! Jimmy?You're not playing that
horrible game again, are you?No, Grandma!I'm doing my homework.Okay, like I said...<i>Let's jack this ride.</i>Well, well, well.While the cat was away,
these mice tried to play.Hey, I think
that might be Shank.Listen up, mice...anyone who tries to play
with this cat's rideis gonna get got.<i>You're going down, Shank.</i>Pyro. Give those punks
the works.With pleasure.<i>End of the road!</i>Gosh dang it!
Now we gotta start all over.Ralph, maybe...Hey, where are you going?I am scared.If we get burned up
in here,that's it, we're dead,
we're gone.So, I think we should
get outta here right now.No, wait, wait.
I have an idea.Hey, Shank?What's up, Pyro?Um, do you ever reckon
we're going a bit too hardon the players?Honestly, no, I don't.Of course, I have empathy for
players like DirtySocks537and BabeRaham_Linkin...but if we just let them win,where's the life lesson?
You know?- Mmm.
- Yeah, but to Pyro's point...I mean, those players
work so hard to get here.I hear you, Felony...but imagine a game
without challenges.The same predictable thing
every single time...who wants that?Shank's right.I just saw a really
insightful TED talk...and I can't really remember
what the guy said.It was more about
how he made me feel.But I think, ultimately,
the point was...I honor your journeys, guys.And we honor yours,
Butcher Boy.Thank you.Hey, Shank,did you ever wonder
what it would be like...if someone actually
did get your car?Well, I know one thing...whoever does will have to
be the best of the best.Good day to you, madam.Who are you?I'm here from the, uh,
Department of Noise.And the thing is, we've been
getting some complaintsdown at HQ.Uh, Larry's the one
who takes the calls.Anyways, someone told Larry...that we've been
hearing a lot ofgun sounds
and screaming sounds...and what-have-you.
That sort of thing.Whoa! This is nice.Where have you been
all my life?Uh, so I came to
check on things.Oh, I'm sorry, who did
you say you were again?Oh, I'm Larry?Uh, you said
Larry took the call.Good job, Larry!Yeah, worked like a charm!<i>Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?</i>And I need yours. Sorry.<i>I'm just...
I'm just gonna go.</i>This is the worst day
of my life!It's a shame
we have to leave so soon.This game is cool.Just get us out of hereso we can get this car
to Spamley and get paid.No problem.Uh-oh.Look at this guy
coming in hot.You mess with the bull, you
get the horns, little girl!You still have value,
Butcher Boy.Oh, no!
It's that Shank lady.She looks upset.Ah, don't worry,
I'll lose her.Where are you going?Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.There is no track.
I can drive anywhere.Whoo!Oh, kid, she's coming up
right behind us.Oh, hello!I believe you have
something of mine.Yeah, come and get it.Ooh!This girl can drive.Would you hurry up
and lose her?I'm trying!Hang on, chumbo!I don't like this!Whoa! Mother Hubbard,
this lady can really drive.Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?Dead end! Dead end!Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.Whoo-hoo!- Oh, yeah!
- That's the stuff.Good job, kid.Oh, yeah,
I feel like me again.One exit straight ahead.You're not gonna lose me
that easy.How did you...?Uh, you might wanna keep
your eyes on the road.Kid!Yo, Department of Noise,
get out of my car!Oh, man,
what are we gonna do?You just stay put,
don't panic.I'm gonna talk to her.Ralph, be careful.It's fine.
This is what heroes do.My bottom is stuck.This car is not designed
for a big boy.I'll tell you that. Hi.You guys really thought
you could just steal my car?Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.No, wait, listen. We aren't
normally car thieves.My friend here,
she's a candy kart racer.You should see her
racing aroundher sweet little track...in her cookie wafer car
we built together.And, well, the thing is, her
perfect little game broke...and it was my fault...so we're here
to try to fix it...and we need money to do that,and someone was
gonna pay us money...- to steal your car...
- Okay, okay.- ...and so we took it.
- You can stop crying.Though I do respectyour wonderful display
of vulnerability.Thank you.I get it, I do.Friendship is
everything to us, too.- Right, guys?
- Word. We're like family.That's really great.So, does this mean
we can keep your car?Absolutely not.
But I do want to help.Hey, you got
your phone on you?- You know it.
- Let's make a video.Pyro, hit big boy
with the blow and go.I'd love to.Wait. What's the...?What are you doing?Say something, first thing
that comes to your mind.I'm gonna wreck it!Good. All right.
Turn it off.Ow.What the heck
did you do that for?Yeah.There are much better ways
to make money on the Internetthan stealing cars...such as becoming
a BuzzzTube star.Am I supposed to know
what that is?Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.It's the video-sharing site.I'm just starting
your account...All right, there you go.If this thing goes viral,
you can make a lot of money.A friend of mine,
chick named Yesss...she's the head algorithm
over there.Tell her I sent you.Yesss will hook you up.Wow, that's really nice
of you.I'm not sure if "nice"
is the right word.Well, thank you.I should be thanking you,
little sister.That race was fun.Oh.Well, thank you again.Uh... You know...While we're talking shop,
what move did you doto get through
that tunnel of fire?Was it a power drift into
a drift jump, maybe, or...?Maybe.If you ever wanna come back
for a rematch...I'd be happy
to kick your butt again.See you.Whoa.Show-off.Man, oh, man,
that place was scary.I know.
It was so exciting!No, exciting is
when you smile.Scary is when
you clench your butt,and my butt
is still clenched.Oh, come on, are you
honestly telling me...that Shank lady wasn't the
coolest person you ever met?Cool? Name one cool thing
about her.Um, let's see, she looks
cool, she talks cool...she drives cool, her hair
is cool, her car is cool...Wait a minute, are you
saying my hair isn't cool?What? No! I'm just saying
the game was next-level.There was no one telling you
what to do or where to go.Hey, just where do you think
you're going?To BuzzzTube.
It's this way.No, no, no. We're going
back to Spamley's.He can give us
some easier loot to find.No, we're supposed to
see Shank's friend.Oh, come on. I don't trust
that Shank one bit.- Well, I do.
- Well, I...- Hello, mister.
- Who are you?I'm your friendly
ebay alert messenger.Huh. An actual eboy.Just here to let you know your
bid expires in eight hours.Eight hours.
Okay, thanks, eboy.You got it, Jackson!Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime
it with Spamley...it will take 20 yearsto make enough money
to buy the wheel.All right, fine.
We'll do it your way.But I'm telling you right now,
that BuzzzTube placeis a terrible idea.Man, there are all kinds of
videos in here.Yeah, if you like
babies and cats.- Look, there's you!
- Oh, yeah.<i>I'm gonna wreck it!</i>I wonder
why those little guysare giving your video
all those hearts?Because obviously
they love me.I told you this place
was a good idea.Yeah,
sure you did, doof.Now, who we supposed to see
about getting paid again?The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.No. No. No.Uninspired, cliched...Ugh! YouTube's got this one.Chewbacca Dad? Really?Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom,
but it's a daddy.No!Heyo! Are you
the head of Al Gore?I am the head algorithm
of BuzzzTube...which means
I curate the content...at the Internet's most
popular video-sharing site.Which means, I don't
have time to trifle...with every shoeless,
mouth-breathing hobothat trundles
into my office.Call security, Maybe.Yes. But, Yesss,
this is the leaf blower guy.Who?The man
with the undulating jowls.So?His video has
1.3 million hearts.Well!Why didn't you tell meI was in the presence
of a genius?Grab him a drink.Yeah, this lady
named Shank...she actually made the video.She's the one who told us
to come see you.No wonder
your video's so dope.Shank is for real cool.Right?She is not.I'm the cool one
getting all the hearts.Well, that's right,
you big baby.Yeah.Um, what'd you say
your name was?Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.Well, Wreck-It Ralph,
you are trending!And these are for you. Hearts,
hearts, hearts, hearts.- Hearts, hearts, hearts!
- Hearts, hearts, hearts!Yes! Hearts!Uh, not to buzzkill
the lovefestyou guys got going on here...but Shank kinda
told us thatviral videos can make,
like, actual money?Oh, hearts are money, honey.Your Buzzzy account converts
hearts into dollars.Ka-ching!$43,000!Kid, we only needed $27,001.
We're done.Oh, no, no, no.That's $43.43? That's not even
half of 27,001.And we only have eight
hours left to save my game.Ugh. Well, I hate to say it,
but that ain't happening.Your video is tapped out.But I thought
I was trenching?Trending.You were.
But that was 15 seconds ago.Now, you're not.Thanks for stopping by,
though.Aw!What are we gonna do, kid?All right, pal, I have
an idea. And hear me out.What if we go back
to <i>Slaughter Race</i>and I ask Shank really...No, no, no. We're not going
back to that death trap.Yesss, what if I made you
a whole bunch of videos...of me doing all kinds of them
crazy things?You mean
saturate the market?That could get you
a lot of hearts fast.Have you thought
this through at all?What do you plan on even doing
in these videos?I'll just copy
whatever's popular.Genius. Yo, Maybe,
what's trending right now?Mmm-hmm. Let's have
a lookie-lookie.As usual, human suffering
is number one...followed by hot peppereating challenges...video game walkthroughs...oh, screaming goats
are back...unboxings, cooking demos,
makeup tutorials...and lastly, ugh, bee puns.<i>Let's "bee" friends.</i>Two weeks in a row, guys.That's a fortnight
of bee puns.He won't be doing any bee puns.
They're beneath you.Oh, I'm doing a bee pun.
Oh, yes, I am.And I'm eating a hot pepper,
and I'm putting on makeup...and whatever else it takes!Because, kid, we came here
to save your gameand we're gonna do it.I love it! Ha!That is what the Internet
was made for!Now, let's get to work.Seen it.Saw that one.Seen it. Seen it.Huh?Yo, McNeely,

coming from?Hey, Josey,did you see
the pepper challenge?Oh, not yet.I'm watching the one
where he just smacks his lips.It's disgusting.<i>You don't want
any real hard lines.</i><i>You just want to blend that

Can I? Can I? Can I?Oh, yes, you're perfect. Here.Thank you!If you're going, I wanna go.No, baby, you've got to stay

kid are like shoes and socks.Or peanut butter and bacon.One cannot exist
without the other.Go on, kid, tell her.It's true.In fact, it's so true
that we will be fineif we're apart
for a minute.Come on, pal. It's my game
we're trying to save.I just wanna get out there

You're just a kid.Oh, and you're
some mature adult?Well, I'm bigger.Don't be insecure,

Don't be a dummy.So where exactly
are you sending her?Since candy girl
comes from an arcade game...I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.Those games are dangerous,
and they rot your brain.Why don't we
send her somewherea little more totally
different than that...and nowhere near there?Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.That sounds safe, and she is
technically a princess...so how about this one herewith the sweet little
pink castle?I love it.Okay, I'll redirect our newest

Thank you very much.</i><i>Um, what is Drax really like?</i>- I am Groot.
- <i>Thank you.</i><i>Yeah. Are you a conifer
or a fruit-bearing tree?</i>- I...
- Excuse me.I'll take this one.
He is Groot,I am Vanellope,click here

have a permit for that pop-up?</i>Uh...<i>That's unauthorized clickbait.
You're coming with us, kid.</i>Boop!<i>She's getting away.</i><i>This way.</i>Ooh!Sorry, mister!Hey, can't you read?
Cast members only!<i>I think she

Ladies, I can explain.See, I'm a princess, too.- Wait, what?
- Yeah.Princess Vanellope
Von Schweetz...of the, uh, <i>Sugar Rush</i>
Von Schweetzes.I'm sure you've heard of us.It'd be embarrassing for you
if you haven't.Huh. What kind of
a princess are you?What kind?- Do you have magic hair?
- No.- Magic hands?
- No.- Do animals talk to you?
- No.- Were you poisoned?
- No!- Cursed?
- No!- Kidnapped or enslaved?
- No!Are you guys okay?
Should I call the police?Then I have to assume
you made a dealwith an underwater
sea witch...where she took your voicein exchange
for a pair of human legs?No! Good Lord,
who would do that?Have you ever had
True Love's Kiss?Ew! Barf!Do you have daddy issues?I don't even have a mom.Neither do we!And now for
the million-dollar question.Do people assume
all your problems got solvedbecause a big strong man
showed up?Yes! What is up with that?She is a princess!Who made your gown?I've never seen
anything quite like it.Oh, this old thing?Oh, I'd so love to
have one of my own.- As would I.
- Me too!- So cool.
- Best outfit ever!Ooh! I want one, too,
you guys!I'll get my mice on this.So this is love.All hail Princess Vanellope,
the queen of comfy!Yay, Vanellope!Of all the thingamabobs
in this entire world...I never thought
I'd get to wear a real...what's it called again?Oh, yeah. Shirt.<i>âª I once had a dream
that I might wear a shirt... âª</i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait! What's going on?Uh, she's singing.Yeah, but there was like music
and a spotlight.Wait, you all
saw it too, right?That's what happenswhen a princess
sings about her dreams.Oh, that's never happened
to me. I mean, not even once.Why don't you give it
a try?What is it you really want?
Sing about that.Okay. Uh, sure.Huh. I could do that.
Um, let's see.<i>âª Oh, steering wheel
Oh, steering wheel</i><i>âª Oh, yes
I want a steering wheel âª</i>Well, there is a lot
to unpack here.Mmm-hmm.So, this steering wheel
you sing of,that's a metaphor?Oh, no, no, no, it's not
a metaphor. I just...I literally want
a steering wheel.I think the issue is
I was a little pitchy.Maybe a little.But sometimes
your song can't start...until you go someplace
to reflect.What works for some of us...is finding a form of water
and staring at it.What?Oh, yes, I like to stare
at a wishing well!I stare at the ocean.Horse trough.Soap bubbles!Wait, you're saying if I just
stare at some water...Uh, important water.Right. Of course.
"Important water."I stare at
the important water...and somehow magically I'll
start singing about my dream?- For sure.
- Mmm-hmm.Uh, yeah, I don't think so,
ladies, but thanks.Five minutes,
Princesses.Another "Which Disney Princess
Are You?" quizletstarts in five minutes.Okay, thank you.Well, I guess it's back
to the gowns, girls.It was lovely to meet you,
Vanellope.And best of luck
finding your song.Uh-huh.What did she just say?We don't know.
We can't understand her.She's from
the other studio.Ah.Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here...with a little box
I'm gonna open.Let's see what we got here.A "Pancake Milkshake
Fun Set." Huh.Got a little heft to it.Something wobbling
around in there.Wonder if we got
the kitty or the bunny.Let's open it up.Man, who would've
guessed a bee punwould be the thing
to put us over the top?Huh. That's the Internet
for you.All right, it is uploading.Hey, mister!Oh. Hi, eboy.Just here to let you knowyour bid does expire
in 30 minutes.Thanks, little eboy.You got it, chairman.You hear that, Yesss?We don't have
a lot of time left.Okay. We just gotta...No, no, no.No! Not you!What? Why are you
angry at the lollipop?What does that mean?The file's not loading.If this doesn't load,
we're not gonna make it.- Hmm.
- You don't have enough hearts.Ralph, where are you going?I'm going down to the floor
to get some hearts.Ah! Genius! Good thinking.Now, someone get me
tech support in here, stat!Only one person.Hey, guys, come and
check out my video,you're gonna love it.Right, right over here.
Yep, here we go.What are you...
You guys!Aw. A cat?You're gonna like this better
than some dusty old cat.Aw.What?Give me that hose, partner.You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.That's it.
Let's see who's in here.Hello?Anybody in here?What the heck is this place?Some kind of libary?"Wreck-It Ralph is back."Hey, they're talking about me.Gee whiz,
the Internet is so positive.<i>"Fix-It Felix, Jr.</i>
was my favorite game."Hmm. Mine, too."Ralph's videos stink."What?"So stupid.""Ralph is the worst.""I hate him.""He's so fat and ugly.""Just a worthless bum,
alone on a pile of bricks."Yo, Ralph,
you in here, dude?Hey, I got to show you...Oh.First rule
of the Internet...do not read the comments.I should have told you that.Look.This place can bring out
the worst in some people...but you gotta ignore all this.This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.I don't care.
It's fine.People hated me my whole life
for being the bad guy.It's just a good reminderthat this is the only heartthat really matters.Vanellope gave me this...and as long as she likes me...I don't need anybody else.And I sure
don't need the Internet.Hold on.It's not all bad.The Internet
can also be a place...where you find a steering
wheel at one website...and make enough money
to buy it at another one.Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.Wait, really?Yes, check your
Buzzzy account.You needed 27K,
you got over 30 grand!Oh, my gosh!This is great!Thank you, Yesss. I couldn't
have done it without you!That's really true.Hey, eboy?What do you need, ace?Can you give me a ride?Let's hop along, Cassidy.Come on, song, come on.I'm reflecting.What is it that I want?What is my quest?What is my dream?Well, ladies, I tried.No song for this princess,
I guess.Ooh! Huh.How does this thing work?<i>Hey, kid, can you see me?</i>Yeah! Yeah,
you're right there.<i>We did it! We got the money!</i>No way, Ralph!
That's great!I'm on my way to ebay
right now with the eboy.We're almost there, champ.Good work, eboy.Hey, meet me out in front of
ebay in five minutes, okay?<i>Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>We're going home, kid!<i>Our lives can finally
get back to normal.</i><i>Whoo-hoo!</i>Wow, I can't believe it.
I get to go home.So, I guess that's it.I guess I just wanted a...
a steering wheel.And now, I got it, so...whoo-hoo.<i>Slaughter Race?</i><i>âª What can it be that calls

Hey, there.Oh, hey, Spamley.What's the good word,
brother?Well, the good word is I just
paid for the steering wheel...and we are going home.Congratulations.Thanks.Hey, have you seen
Vanellope anywhere?Oh, uh, your little chum?
Uh, no, no, I haven't.Hope she's not lost.Let me try to reach her
on this doohickey.See over there?
Over that mountain?- Yeah.
- That's the Sequoia Speedway.<i>It's gonna be unlocked
next month.</i>Hey, what are you doing
in that awful game with her?<i>I think
the track will end...</i>right over there. Yo,
it's gonna be so tight.Oh, I love it.Hey, can I tell you somethingthat I don't think
I could ever tell Ralph?Of course.I know it sounds crazy...but the second I walked
into this game, it felt...Well, it felt like home.I mean, more than
<i>Sugar Rush</i> ever did.Oh, yeah? How so?'Cause it's like my dream.It's full of weirdos...and the racing
is super dangerous...and you never know
what's gonna happen next.I mean, back home,I know exactly
what's gonna happen next...because Ralph's dream is to
do the same thing every day.Hmm.Here's something
I wish I'd learned years ago.There is no lawsaying best friends
have to have the same dreams.You know?Whoa.Yeah.You are a very
wise person, Shank.And a good friend, too.Thank you.Around here, peeps like
to say, "Shank you."You know,
after you go homeand your life
gets back to normal...you are always
welcome here.But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.I want this to be my life.I can't go home now.I just can't.Wow.You know,
where I come from,that's called
a kick in the face.I can't believe it.A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.She's supposed to be
my best friend.No, this can't be right.No, she's been brainwashed.That's what this is.Because the Vanellope I knowwould never abandon me
like that.I gotta get her out
of there now.Hey, easy now, tiger.I admire the impulse...but you charge in there
like some white knight...she's liable to hold it
against you.So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a gamethat's obviously bad for her?Of course not.Then how do I make her leave?She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or...Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?- Who's asking?
- Whoa.Back home, me and the kidused to goof off
in this game called <i>Tron.</i>But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow...and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.So, is there a wayto do something
like that to <i>Slaughter Race?</i>Oh, there's ways.Follow me.I got mothers' maiden names...social security numbers,
PIN numbers...Now, this area down hereis what's called the Darknet.A lot of shady characters
hang out down here...so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!Oh, there you are.Now Gord here, he's
dabbled in virus-making.But his cousin, this guy
we're gonna go see...Double Dan, this dude
is a virus-making machine.Oh, oh, here we go.Are you sure this is safe?Is it safe?
Of course it is.Just whatever you do, do not
look at his little brother.Oh, he has a little brother?Double Dan!Long time no see.Who are you?JP Spamley.Uh, we met one time
over at Friendster...which tells you
it had to be a long time ago.- Oye. What are you looking at?
- Nothing.Are you looking at my brother?- No, sir.
- Don't you lookat my little brother.- Oh, no, I wasn't.
- He's very self-conscious!You?What are you doing here?Uh...The reason I came to
your neck of the face...I mean, there's a face
in your neck. I mean, woods.Neck of the woods. The reason
I'm here is 'cause I...Well, I heard
a little tumor, rumor...I heard a rumor
that you could, well,give me a harmless virus
kind of thing...that might be able toslow down
the <i>Slaughter Ra</i> game?Oh, yeah.My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.Crash it? No!No, no, no.I don't want
anyone getting hurt.Hmm.If there's a way
to just, uh...I don't know...just make the cars
go slow or something...so the game is boring...and my friend
comes back home to me.Allow me to
introduce you to Arthur.Easy there, boy.He's keen.Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknessesthat make a program insecure.You release him into that
<i>Slaughter Race</i> game,Arthur will find some defect
in the code.Then he'll copy that defectand spread it
all over the game...until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"...just like you wanted.Okay.Just to be super clear here...no one gets hurt, right?Are you stupid?Well, uh...Because the only way
anyone gets hurt...is if you are stupid.All you have to do...is make sure the virus stays
in <i>Slaughter Race.</i>Right. Don't be stupid.Make sure it doesn't get out
of <i>Slaughter Race.</i>Goiter it. Gah!- Got it! Got it.
- Get out!Thank you,
you're a cyst face.- Out!
- I mean, assistance.Thank you for your
cyst face... Assistance.- Get out!
- Goodbye!Ugh.Ah! Fiddlesticks!
Well, that's game.Ah, beginner's luck.Come on, kid.
I know a hustlewhen I see one.- Player's on the way.
- Thanks, Bob.- Let's roll!
- Game faces on, guys.Show time. You ready
for your first race?Um, yeah. I think so.Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.Mmm. You didn't tell
Ralph yet, did you?Not exactly.Come on, V.
He's your best friend.You gotta let him knowyou're planning on
staying here for a while.I know. But he's gonna
get really upset.Yeah, he might,
but you guys...you'll talk, you'll work it
out, you'll figure it out.Yeah, but what if we don't?What if his feelings
get hurt so bad...he won't wanna be
my friend anymore?Look.
All friendships change...but the good ones...they get stronger
because of it.Uh, Shank,
I hate to bother you...but the player is waiting.I'm not gonna tell you
what to do, kid.It's your call.Yeah, okay.All right.Let's race.<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i><i>Scanning for insecurities.</i><i>"Precious Car-go."</i><i>Deliver the car
to Bert's Chop Shop...</i><i>but watch out
for Shank and her crew.</i>Power drift
into a drift jump!I saw it! You're amazing!Thank you.<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i>Looks like we're not finished.
Come on, V.Ralph?Huh.Okay. Relax. Relax!I'll just call him
after the race.It'll be okay.<i>Ralph will be fine.</i><i>Insecurity detected.</i><i>Copying insecurity.</i><i>Distributing insecurity.</i><i>Distributing insecurity.</i><i>Distributing insecurity.
Distributing...</i>What is happening?What's going on, Spamley?The whole place
is going crazy.I thought that virus was just
supposed to slow down her car.It was.It must've found something
real unstable in there.It's her glitch.<i>Game reboot begins</i><i>in 60 seconds.</i>Whoa, hey! Hey, Ralph,
you can't go in there.They're gonna
reboot the game...and anything that doesn't
belong in therewill be deleted.Yeah, and if I don't
get her outta there,Vanellope's gonna die!Come on, kid. The game's crashing.
Let's go.I think it's my glitch.I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
destroy your game.We'll be fine, but your code
isn't part of this game.We got to get you out of here now.
Follow me to the exit.Oh, no, no!Kid!Kid, where are you?The server
is rebooting, Ralph.Both of you have to
get out of here now.Kid, I got you. I got you.<i>Game reboot...</i><i>in five, four, three...</i><i>two, one.</i><i>Reboot in progress.</i>Come on, Vanellope. Wake up.Come on. Don't leave me, kid.Ralph?Oh. There you are.
You okay, kid?Ralph, I messed up so bad.No. No, you didn't,
it's okay.This is all because of me
and my glitch.I should've
just stayed with you...instead of following
some stupid dream.I've ruined everything.No, kid, no.Ah, look. I didn't mean
for it to happen like this.It was not supposed
to be this bad.You didn't mean
for what to happen?I mighta,
kinda sorta put a...harmless little virus
in the game.A virus?You did this?I wouldn't have done anythingif I hadn't heard you
tell Shank...that you wanted to live in
<i>Slaughter Race</i> forever.So you were spying on me?Hey. You're not exactly
innocent here.You were gonna ditch everybody
and abandon <i>Sugar Rush.</i>Oh, please.
I'm one of 16 racers.They'd never miss me.What about me?Why would I ever spend
another second with you...after what you did?No!No.Vanellope,
where are you going?Wherever you're not.Wait a minute.
I can explain.No! You will not
follow me.Vanellope, please...A friend would never do
what you did. Never!So you leave me alone!Vanellope, no, no, no! Please!Please! What did I do?<i>Scanning for insecurities.</i><i>Vanellope, come on,
don't leave me!</i><i>Insecurity detected.</i><i>Copying insecurity.</i>Oh, no, no, no.<i>Distributing insecurity.</i>Come on.Where is it?Ooh!Oh, no.You are such an idiot.What is your problem, Ralph?
I told you, don't follow me.Friend?Cut that out.
You're scaring me.- Friend!
- Huh? Whoa!- What the...?
- Friend?Friend!Sweet mother of Ralph!<i>In breaking news,</i><i>the Internet
is under assault...</i><i>as a massive
denial-of-service attack...</i><i>crashes servers
across the web.</i><i>The Wreck-It Ralph virus</i><i>is fast-moving
and destructive.</i>Friend? Huh?Friend?Huh?<i>Experts are still trying to
understand who or what</i><i>the virus's intended
target may be.</i>Friend.Friend.Friend!Friend!I found 130 results for"Where does my high school
girlfriend live now?"You're welcome.- Mr. KnowsMore!
- Hmm.Oh, delightful!You're that courteous
little cherubwho says "please"
and "thank you."What can KnowsMore
help you find today?There's a whole...Whole Foods,
a hole in the ozone...<i>A Whole Lotta Love</i> by
British rockers Led Zeppelin?No! No! There's a whole bunch
of Ralphs chasing me.Friend...This would probably be
an appropriate timefor me to shutter my site.How long you thinkbefore they get in here?Precisely one second.Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!Hey, hey, hey!It's me!
It's the real me!Ow!- Ralph?
- My apologies.I followed those things here.I think they're looking
for you, kid.Yeah, you think?
What did you do?I'm so sorry.
I don't how this happened.Well, I think
it's fairly obvious.It happened because
an insecurity virus cloned...all of your needy, clingy,
self-destructive behavior.The very behavior
which left uncheckedcan destroy friendships...and in this particular case,
the entire Internet!KnowsMore!
You have all the answers.Official query...what do I do if clones of meare trying to capture
my friend? Search.I find two results
for your query.Either you put all the clones
in therapy.Not very realistic.Or, the anti-virus district
is surroundedby a gate made from
security software.If Vanellope could somehowlead all of the clones
through the gate...they would be deleted
all at once.Sort of a co-dependent
pied piper situation.Wait. We know a pied piper.- We do?
- Yesss.- Who?
- Yesss!Yeah, but who is it?Oh, you mean Yesss!Thanks for your help,
KnowsMore.It's a bit of an empty gesture
at this point,wouldn't you say?Guess I forgot
to tell Ralphthat when you
break the Internet...you don't literally
have to break the Internet.I can't believe he did this.Yeah, well, I mean,
dude obviously madesome real questionable
choices here.But he also made a bee pun to
save his best friend's game...so what can I say, kid,
life's complicated.You ready to pied the piper?Yoo-hoo! Up here!It's me, your bestest friend
in the whole wide world...who you can't live without!Friend!Wow, from up here I can see
how I do come across as...needy, and clingy,and self-destructive
like KnowsMore said.Listen, kid...I don't blame youfor not wanting
to be my friend anymore.I never said I didn't
want to be your friend.I said you were acting like
a bad friend. Which you were.I know I was, but I...Hey, my babies!That's the anti-virus district
straight ahead. Whoo!All right, to be
continued, okay?Whoo-hoo!
We're gonna make it!You guys okay?I'm fine!Yeah, all good.
Look, we can still do this.Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.Uh...Uh, guys?Friend?That is unsettling.Friend.Get Vanellope out of here now.What about you, Ralph?Just go. I got a date with
the man in the mirror.Hey, you!You keep away from her!I'm gonna wreck it!She's not your friend!She's my friend!Here it is, this way.Come on, kid.
We gotta move.Eeeee-oh-boy!No!Whoa!Vanellope!Hey! Let go of me!- Kid!
- Ralph!Hey!Hey, get back here!Huh?You put her down!Whoa!Vanellope!You know, you're acting
like a real bad guy here!No!Well, you are!And I will never
be your friend!Hey, doofus!Ralph!Catch me if you can,
you big dummy!I got you, little sister.Now go!
Get out of here!- Ralph!
- Go!No!
Don't hurt him!Please, no!Stop it!
You're squishing him!You're gonna
kill my best friend!Fine! You win!
You win, okay?Just please put him down.I'll be your
only friend, okay?Just let him go.No! No, kid.Huh?That's it.
That's it. Yeah.Put him down
and I'll go with you...and we'll be
best friends forever.Just me and you.That's what you want, right?Well,
that's not what I want!It's not right to hold
a friend back from her dreams!You don't own her!That's not how
friendship works!You need to let her go!Hey.You need to let her go.I know. It's gonna hurt
a little bit when you do.Oh, who am I kidding?
It's gonna hurt a lot.But you're gonna be okay.And we're gonna be okay.Right, kid?Of course we are. Always.See? No matter
where she goes...or where she lives...she's always gonna
be our friend.And we just gotta trust her.Because that's what
best friends do.Right?Thanks, buddy.Wow!I feel good about this.Mmm.Mmm.Ralph, look!I think you fixed
your insecurity!You're right.Whoo-hoo!Ralph, no!Whoa!Park it right here, Ralph!Your ol' pal
JP Spamley's gotcha!Whoo!Wow, that didn't work.Look up there!It's a big strong man
in need of rescuing.Hah!Mmm.Oh, thanks, Frogger.Wait a minute.Who are all of you?We're friends of Vanellope's.Yeah, and any friend
of Vanellope'sis a friend of ours.You're welcome.Ralph!Looking good, big fella!Heyo!This dress is not made
for a big boy.It's going right up
the back alley there.Let me just make
a little adjustment.There we go.<i>Internet users are breathing</i><i>a collective sigh
of relief tonight.</i><i>Just as mysteriously
as it appeared,</i><i>the Wreck-It Ralph virus
has vanished.</i>You know what
I just realized?The sun never rises
or sets here...because everything's
always on.Well, now, isn't that
an astute observation?I know, right?You know,
other than KnowsMore,I'm probably the smartest guy
on the Internet.Yeah. Yeah.Yo, V. We're about to come
back online. You ready?Be right there!Hey, Ralph,
don't be a stranger!Well, I can't be much stranger
than you, Shank.Oh. That's a good dad joke.Hey, don't forget.You know Shank added
my code and everything,so I'll be able
to regenerate.I'm gonna be totally safe.No, I know.
It's gonna be great.You found your dream game.Yeah, I did.I did.So, uh...I guess I should probably
head in there now, you know?Oh, before you go,
I wanted to give you this.Oh, I'm so sorry
I broke it, Ralph.No, no. It's okay.Now we can both
have a half. See?Yeah!I love you so much.I'm really gonna miss you.I'm gonna miss you too, kid.I really am.All right.Okay, getting a little clingy
on me, here.Go on. Get out of here.The world's
waiting for you, kid.<i>I'll be honest,</i><i>it still feels kind of
weird around here.</i><i>I mean, a lot has changed.</i><i>Even though we got
that steering wheel</i><i>and saved</i> Sugar Rush...<i>it's never really gonna
be the same.</i><i>For one thing,
the racers aren't even</i><i>that obnoxious anymore.</i>Oh, golly. I'm sorry

Zangief's book club.</i>Good point, Bison.
And how about you, Ralph?Do you feel Dostoyevskyintended to make
narrator unreliable?Um...I do and I don't.You do, and you don't.Duality.
That's really deep, Ralph.Thanks, Sonic.I don't know
what I'm talking about.<i>Oh. And we got this new thing
we do every Friday night...</i><i>where we all go and hang out
in a different game.</i><i>I actually hosted this week.</i>Heyo!Hope you're all hungry.
I made burnt pie.What's burnt pie,
Wreck-It?Oh, it's just a pie
that you burn.You can use any pie.You just leave it
in the oven too long.<i>Yeah, we really do
have a lot of fun.</i>I guess that's pretty much
all the news I got for you.<i>Oh, man, your stories
never disappoint, Ralph.</i><i>I just wish
we could hang out sooner.</i>Yeah. Me, too.When did you say you were
getting those days off?<i>Uh, our upgrade
starts on January 25th,</i><i>so, like, two months
from now.</i>Oh, that'll go by in a flash.
Oh, speaking of which...you want me to bring you

Let's get to work, buddy.Hey, Mo, did you like

what was called an Obscurus.It's an unstable,
uncontrollable dark forcethat busts out and attacks.And then vanishes.<i>Obscurials can't survive long, can they?</i>There's no documented case of an Obscurial
surviving past the age of 10.The one I met in Africa was 8 when she...She was 8 when she died.What are you telling me here?That Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?(SINGING) <i>My momma, your momma</i>

your acquaintance, Jacob.<i>And I hope you get your bakery.</i>GRAVES: You're an interesting man,
Mr. Scamander.Mr. Graves.You were thrown out of Hogwarts
for endangering human life.- That was an accident.
- With a beast.Yet one of your teachers argued strongly
against your expulsion.Now,what makes Albus Dumbledoreso fond of you?I really couldn't say.So setting a pack
of dangerous creatures loose here wasjust another accident. Is that right?Why would I do it deliberately?To expose wizardkind.To provoke war between
the magical and non-magical worlds.Mass slaughter
for the greater good, you mean?Yes.<i>Quite.</i>I'm not one of Grindelwald's
fanatics, Mr. Graves.I wonder what you can tell me
about this, Mr. Scamander.It's an Obscurus.But it's not what you think.I managed to separate it
from the Sudanese girl<i>as I tried to save her.</i><i>So I wanted to take it home to study it.</i><i>But it cannot survive outside that.</i><i>It could not hurt anyone, Tina.</i>So it's useless without the host?Useless?Useless?That is a parasitical,
magical force that killed a child.What on earth would you use it for?You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.You brought this Obscurus
into the City of New Yorkin the hope of causing mass disruption,breaking the Statute of Secrecy
and revealing the magical world.You know that can't hurt anyone.
You know that.You are therefore guilty of
a treasonous betrayalof your fellow wizards
and are sentenced to death.Miss Goldstein,
who has aided and abetted you...No, she's done nothing of the kind.Receives the same sentence.(CRYING)Just do it immediately.- I will inform President Picquery myself.

- They need you downstairs.I'll Obliviate this guy.You ain't qualified.Hey, Sam.Does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?- How did you...
- Let me Obliviate this guy,and she'll never hear about it from me.What are you doing?Hush. Teen's in trouble.
I'm trying to listen.Jacob, where's Newt's case?I think that guy Graves took it.Okay. Come on.What, you're not gonna Obliviate me?Of course not. You're one of us now.TINA'S MOTHER: <i>Tina.</i>(GRUNTS)It's okay.QUEENIE: <i>Alohomora.</i><i>Aberto.</i>He would know

No. (CHUCKLES) I, uh...You get well now.Thanks.Credence, have you found the child?I can't.Show me.(SHUSHING)(WHIMPERING)My boy, the sooner we find this child,the sooner you can put that pain
in the past where it belongs.I want you to have this, Credence.I would trust very few with it.Very few.But you...You're different.And when you find the child,
you touch this symbol,and I will know and I will come to you.Do this, and you will be honoredamong wizards forever.The child is dying, Credence.Time is running out.Your grandfather kept pigeons?Mine bred owls.I used to love feeding them.TINA: Graves always insisted
the disturbances were caused by a beast.We need to catch all your creaturesso he can't
keep using them as a scapegoat.There's only one still missing.Dougal, my Demiguise.Dougal?Slight problem is that,
um, he's invisible.- Invisible?
- Yes.Most of the time. He does, um...- How do you catch something...
- With immense difficulty.Oh.(CHUCKLES)Gnarlak.- Excuse me?
- Gnarlak.He was an informant of mine
when I was an Auror.He used to trade
in magical creatures on the side.He wouldn't happen to have an interest
in paw prints, would he?He's interested in anything he can sell.(1920s MUSIC PLAYING)(SINGING) <i>Tears of pearl</i><i>When the dragon

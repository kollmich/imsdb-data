Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.Some kind of an animal.Jesus!
Her water's broken!She's going into
uterine contractions!We'll have to do
a C-section!What you got down there,
little man?Oh, that's
my heat seeker.I'll bet this.Aah!Ha ha ha!So, where are we going?It's a surprise,
baby.Yeah, I like surprises.Yeah.Whoo!
Oh, my God!What the fuck
are we doing here?Whoo! Look at all that.Ha ha ha!What the fuck is that?Hey!What did you just say?Wow.Whoo! Hey, what's up?Unh! Aan!Whoo!All right.Ha ha ha!Yeah.Whoo!Ha ha ha!What's happening?Unh!Whoa!Aan.Fuck.Fuck. I need a drink.Ahh!No! No!Aah!What's wrong, baby?Aah! Aah!No! No!Aah! No!Ha ha ha!Is that him?Jesus, that's him.It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.Come on, daywalker!Aah!Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!Unh!Aah!Aah!That's him!
That's him! Get him!Fuck him up!We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.Whoo!Yaah!Yaah!Quinn...I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.Thought I might try fire
for a change.Give my regards to Frost.No! Please don't!Put him out.Yes, sir.
Paramedics.Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm, too.1, 2, 3.Oh, Jesus, that's rank.Paramedics said
he was still screamingwhen they found him
stapled to a wall.That's very pretty.Did you check
the chem count?His sugar's
3times norm,phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.You took this
off a D.O. A?Yeah.But this doesn't
make any sense.The red blood cells
are biconvex,which is impossible.Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.OK, Curtis, it's3.00
in the morning...This is not a joke.I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.I thought you promised
to give me some distance.I just want you to come down
and take a look.OK. Show me the body.And I don't want to hear
a word about us.Done. We've had
that conversation.You haven't started on
the internal organs yet?Just a blood sample
through the pericardium.The maxilla looks
a little deformed.There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.I'm going
to start the "Y"and check
the tracheal mucosa.Let me ask you
something.Honestly...you ever have second
thoughts about us?Sometimes.But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.Want to cut me
some slack here?You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.Look, Curtis...I'm trying.It's over.Yaah!Aah!Call security!Aah!Came back
to finish you off.Get out of my way,
you freak!Freeze!Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?!Aah!
Aah!Yaah!Aah!Hey, you! Freeze!Aah!Aah!Aah!Freeze!Hold it right there!Aah! Aah!My shoulder.It's dislocated.Aah!Uhh!Whistler.Whistler.Bringing home
strays now?She's been bitten.Should've
killed her, then.Yeah, I know.But I didn't.You watch her close.If she starts to turn,
You finish her off.Or I will.Uhh.She's border line.Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.Dr Karen Jenson,Listen close.I'm Going to inject you
with allium sativum...garlic.This is going
to hurt... a lot.It was Quinn.Frost's little
errand boy?You get
a lead on him?No.Too bad.Uhh!Hold her.I give her fifty-fiftyif she makes it
through the night.Blade...the daywalker...still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.How many died?We don't have
an exact count.Apparently, he used
a lot of sliver.We're having
difficulty...Send in Frost.Deacon Frost.You can come in now.These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.Are they?They draw needless
attention to our kind.You know our policy.Your policy,
not mine.Our livelihood...depends on our ability
to blend inand our discretion.Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.We should be ruling
the humans,not running aroundmaking back-alley treaties
with them.For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,not our allies.You're out of line, Frost.Am I?Or maybe I'm just
The first to say out loudwhat we've
all been thinking.We have existed this wayfor thousands of years.Who are youto challenge our ways?You're not even
a pureblood.Like it matters.I was born a vampire,as was every other member
of this house,but you, Frost...you were merely turned.The world belongs to us,not the humans.You know that.Do we have any other
business to discuss?Well, uh...there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.We're having
difficulty...And have you made
the transfer to the...Gitano...you may wake upone day
and find yourself extinct.You're a week early.Yeah.Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.Yeah, I figured
that might happen.You take care, all right?I must be getting
soft in my old age,letting you bring home
a stray like that.It was damn stupid of you.Might've lucked out,
though.I checked her background.It turns out
she's a haematologist.She might be useful to us.I doubt it.I'm serious.I took a look
at that notebook of hers.She's onto something.I had to increase
the dose.It's over
50 milligrams now.That's getting
dangerous.Just do it,old man.Ahh.Uhh...Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?Who are you people?My name's
Abraham Whistler.You've met Blade.So, am I
a prisoner here?Not at all.We just had to take
certain precautionsbefore we let you go.You got to understand,they're everywhere.Vampires...the Hominus nocturna.We hunt them, you see...moving from one city
to the nexttracking
their migrations.They're hard to kill.They tend to regenerate.And I'm supposed
to believe all this?Well, you already met
Mr Crispy at the hospital.What do you think?So, what do you use, then?Stakes? Crosses?Crosses don't do squat.Some of the legends
are true, though.Vampires are severely
allergic to sliver.Feed them garlic,and they go into
anaphylactic shock.Then, of course,
there's always sunlight,ultraviolet rays.I got this sucker
running.You want to give it
a try tonight?It's still heavy.Well, you're so big.If you want to live
to see another day,you'll be out of town
by nightfall.So where am I
supposed to go?You've been exposed to them.One way or another, somebody's
Going to take you out.There's a war going on
out there.Blade, myself,
a few others,we've tried to keep it
from spilling overonto the streets.Sometimes,
people like yourselfget caught
in the crossfire.I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.They own the police.You have to understand,
they're everywhere.Chances are you've
seen them yourselfand didn't know it...on the subway
or in a bar.So that's it?You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?Here.Vampire mace...sliver nitrate,
essence of garlic.You keep your eyes open.Be careful.One other thing...buy yourself a gun.If you start getting
sensitive to day light...if you find
you're thirstyregardless of how much
you had to drink,then I suggest
you take that gunand use it on yourself.Better that
than the alternative.You have been warned
before.These archives
are restrictedto members
of the House of Erebus.You are wasting your time.It's a dead language.The ancient texts
can never be translated.You wouldn't even
Understand them.Damn it, Frost!I'm talking to you!Shh.Keep your voice down,
Gitano.We're in a library.You dont need
to shout.What are you up to,
Frost?What are you
Going to do, hmm?What?You bore me.Hey!Remember
what we told you.You keep your eyes open.They're everywhere.But it's daytime!How you doing?Hit here. Hey.I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa!Whoa. Hold on,
Hold on, Hold on.Police officer.I'm sorry, OK?Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.The front door was open.What are you doing in here?I'm just here
on a routine check.Look, I'm...
I'm Officer Krieger,42nd precinct.You're Karen Jenson,
right?Yeah.Your co-workers
at the hospitalsaid that you were
kidnapped last night.Are you OK?What happened to
the other doctor I was with?Curtis Webb?Um, he died.No, look,don't worry about that
right now, OK?Why?Because you're dead,
too, you bitch.Aah!Bitch!
What is it?What is this, garlic?Yeah. He said it would
work against vampires.Vampires?Who said I was
a vampire, huh?Nobody.He's a familiar...a vampire wannabe.If he's loyal enoughand he proves himself, maybe
his master will turn him.Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?Get over it.Is all that necessary?That's a glyph...a vampire cattle brand.It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker,then they have to answer
to his owner.Deacon Frost.We've been tracking him
for a long time.All right.Officer Krieger,you Going to be a good
little bloodhound, huh?Tell us what your master's
been up to.Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.You going
to rob me, too?How do you think that we
Fund this organization, huh?We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.It's fake.Well...looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?Hillbarn Clinic.I know this place.
It's a blood bank.Owned by vampires,and there's one
in every city.And they always deliver.So, where were you
taking it?I don't know what
you're talking... aah!Ooh!Look, take it easy.I'm only Going to ask you
one more time.Where were you taking it?Go fuck yourself.Fuck me?
No, you fuck this.You better wake up.The world you live in is
Just a sugar-coated topping.There is another world
beneath it...the real world.And if you want
to survive it,you better learn
to pull the trigger.Wait a minute.I'm coming with you.You're useless.I have to stick with you.It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enoughto find a cure for myself.There is no cure.He's not going
to come back.Nobody's thats stupid.When you understand
the nature of a thing,you know what
it's capable of.It's Krieger.I'm at 16-0-0-9.Yes?Get me through.I got a delivery
in progress here,and I just had a run-in
with Blade.I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!Looks like
we hit pay dirt.That's a vampire mark.It means that
there's a safe housearound here somewhere...a place they can go
with donors coming.See the valets
over there?They're vampires.So is the doormanand the whore
on the corner.How can you tell?By the way they move...the way they smell.Psst.It's like a bad dream.There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.Like what?Like me.OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,so forget what you've seen
in the movies.You use a stake, sliver,
or sun light.You know how to use
one of these?Nope...but I'll damn sure
learn quick.The safety's off,
rounds already chambered...sliver hollow point
filled with garlic.You aim for the head
or the heart.Anything else is your ass.Do you have
an invitation?What you got?Kenji!Ohh!Where's the entrance?I can't tell you
that, man.Uhh!I'm Going to ask you
one more time.Where's the entrance?OK. OK.It's in the freezer.Come on, man!
I told you!It's in the fridge!OK.You give Frost
a message from me.You tell him it's
open season on suck heads.Some kind of archive.This must be where they keep
most of their records.Isn't this just
a little high-tech?They've got their claws
into everything...politics, finance,
real estate.They already own
half of downtown.Frost throws a good party.Yeah...but where is he?Come on, baby.Don't keep everyone
waiting.Deacon,there's someone here
to see you.I got to talk to you,
Frost.I'm sorry.
I had to come here.It's a mistake
Going to Pearl's.I know that.
Dumb fucking me.I know you're
disappointed.Am I that
transparent?You want
to meet him?Yeah.I can get you guys
in with him,because we're tight.
We're like brothers.Fuck.Aw, fuck. Frost.Hey.
Yeah.Deac. Deac.I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.They've been dying
to meet you.They are so psyched.Bad ass bitches.
They...Hi.Deac?Frost, it's about Blade.Aw, he's busy, you know?Because, like, when
he's focused on business...Look, Frost,
this is important.Blade was waiting for me,using the girl as bait.And you were stupid
enough to take it.Shut up, bitch.I didn't know he was
Going to be there.It was a trap, see?But don't worry
About it.It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.Yeah!Whoo!Forget the girl.I want Blade.I know you do.You hear me, Quinn?I want him alive.What?Wait a minute, man.You want him alive?What's that smell?...image carefully, Frost.You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.Krieger, is that you?He... he's here!He's here!This must be Pearl,the record keeper.He's Going to kill me!You need me, Frost!
You need me!Pearl, you're history.Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.Frost.Ruthless bloodsucker.Congratulations, Blade.Frost.I hear you've
been lookin' for me.I'm flattered.It'll pass.Fuck.What is that?That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. lamp.We're gonna playa little game
of 20 questions.Depending on
how you answer,you may walk out
of here with a tan.What's that?Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.It's routine research.
Heh heh.Actually,
it's a video game.That must've hurt.It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!What prophecy?Oh, I'm not really sure.There are so many out...And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!Is that so?Well, that's
what Frost says.Then you won't mind meborrowing this
for a while, will you?If he moves, fry him.What's in here?Nothing.
It's a... a storeroom.But youre
wasting your time.There's nothing
of importance to anyone.Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.No!He moved.What is this?These are the pagesfrom The Book
of Erebus,the Vampire Bible.It contains everything...their entire history.La Magra must be
one of their legends.Why is Frost
so interested in La Magra?Shh!Give me your hand.Do you remember me?Give it to him!Hey! Hey!Nice one.Heh.Well, well, well.You took my arm, man.Remember?But it's cool.I gota new one.Think I'll ever
play piano again?You can slice him,
you can dice him,but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!Check it out.I've got his pig sticker.Ah ha ha ha...Ohh! Aah!You're a fuckup, Crease!
Ha ha ha ha!You're a fuckup!"I got his pig sticker!"Ohh.You're just
full of surprises,ain'tyou, chief?Stay with me, sweetness...'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.Ah, looky here.Sliver.Nice craftsmanship, huh?Probably costyou
a pretty penny.Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...just a little too seriously,
don't you think?Come to think of it, Blade,I owe you one.Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...I owe you two.Oh, what's so funny,
bright eyes?I'm expecting company.Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?No! No guns!No! No! No!No! Fuckin' this way!Drop the guns!I need him!He wants Blade alive! Go!You've been
listening in the whole time?Keeping
radio contact.Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?Christ!
I'm too old for this.Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.Whistler!He can take care
of himself.Jump!Aah!Aah!Aah!Aah!What are you
gonna do?Oh, my God.What's wrong?It's dislocated.Ah!Let me help you.Aah!Let me give you...No! Getaway.You're one of them,
aren't you?No.I'm something else.I found him
when he was 13.He'd been livin'
on the streets,feedin' off
the homeless.His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.I took him
for a vampire at first.Almost killed him, too.Then I realized
what he was.Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampirewhile she was pregnant.She died, but he lived.Unfortunately,he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.He can withstand
garlic, sliver,even sunlight,and he's got
their strength.This time tomorrow,all those wounds of his
will be healed.He still ages
like a human, though.See, vampires
age slower than us.Unfortunately...he also inherited
their thirst.I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.Time's runnin' out.His body's
startin' to reject it.So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have falled.Why do you hunt them?I had a family once...wife and two daughters.Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',a vampire.He toyed with 'em first,tried to make me decidewhich order
they'd die in.We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,but it's gettin' worse.Because of Frost.There's somethin'
happenin'in the vampire ranks.It's somethin' big...and I'd stake my lifethat son of a bitch
is at the centre of it.Blade.Whistler told me
what happened.He told me
what you are.You don't know me.You don't know
anything about me.I'm not human.You look human
to me...Humans don't
drink blood.That was
a longtime ago.Maybe you should
let that go.I have spent
my whole lifelooking for that thing
that killed my mother.It made me what I am.And every time I take
one of those monsters out,I geta little piece
of that life back,so don't you tell me
about forgetting....my fault he took us
by surprise!Two of them against your
entire security force?Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate......stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!Aah! You little skeez!Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.You got
what you deserved.Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!He took my hand again!Listen to me.
I want him alive.What the fuck
are you talk...you want him alive?We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.Big guy, relax.Be patient.Now, we gota lot
to do here.I need you, man.Heh.Heh.I need you.Yeah.Morning.How you feelin'?Look at that.Whew. Gettin' a little
toasty out here, huh?Heh heh.When was the last timeyou stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,so you never had
the pleasure, have you?That's OK.It's all right.Least we're here together.Share the moment,which means a lot to me,
by the way, really.I mean that.I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.Bit of an innocent,
you might say.Do what you want,
Frost.Doesn't make
any difference.You just don't
fuckin' get it.You're never
gonna be a pureblood.Hold him.You will never rule us.Aah!Aah!Ow.Jesus Christ.Have a nice day.Sorry, you old dog.You just gota little
too long in the tooth.What, man?
That was funny."Long, tooth."
Funny.Did I tell you
the one about...Aah!What have you done
with Dragonetti?Let's get down to business,
shall we?I need 12 volunteers.
Tkk tkk.Whistler.What is this?Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.I took it
from the archives.It's written in blood.It's from
The Book of Erebus.I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.It's somethin'
about the Blood God,the spirits of the 12.I... I don't know.I can't make out
the rest of it.Maybe this'll help.I'll figure out something.So what's all this?Took a trip to
the hospital last night,borrowed some equipment.For your
miracle cure?This is E.D.T.A.It's an anticoagulant.We use it
to treat blood clots.Now look what happens
when I introduce itonto a sample
of vampire blood.Take a step back.The reaction's
energetic.Some cure.I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.But maybe
you could use itto explode
some vampire heads.Wait a minute.I need a sample
of your blood.Later.Gotta go downtown.Need some serum.Serum can wait.This is important.Is he sick?Cancer.You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?We have
a good arrangement.He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.You know,
my mother used to say,"A cold heart
is a dead heart."You don't look so good.I'm just a little tired.You know we've been...workin' all night.I guess we didn't
catch it in time.You got another day,two at the most.For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.You make it sound
like I'm already dead.Blade.How you doin', chief?Easy.Wouldn't want
our little friend hereto wind upon the back of
a milk carton, now would we?Ah, it's nice
to finally meet you, man.Had my eye on you
for years.I know all about you...your serum, Whistler...
everything.Sun block.Hey, it's a start, right?The goal, of course,
is to be like you,the daywalker.You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?All our strengths...none of our weaknesses.Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?You can't keep denying
what you are, man.Heh. You think the humanswill ever accept
a half-breed like you?They can't.
They're afraid of you.And they should be.You're an animal.You're afuckin'
maniac.Look at 'em.They're cattle,pieces of meat.What difference does it make
how their world ends?Plague...war...famine.Morality doesn't even
enter into it.We're just a function
of natural selection, man,the new race.Looks like
your mascara's running.I'm offering you a truce.I want you with us.What do you think,
I'm stupid?You're familiar
with the Blood God.Frost...you're nothing
to me...but another
dead vampire.You're an idiot.
You know that?I came down here
offering you an easy way out,and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.Careful.What do I care?They're nothing
but cattle...just like you said.If you wanna take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,but I promise you
by the time this is over,you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's...aah!Go home.It was simple.Why do vampires
need to drink blood?'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.Right. So it's
a genetic defect,just like
haemolytic anaemia.That means that
we have to treat itwith gene therapy,rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.Are you sure
that's safe?I have no idea,but I don't have
a choice, do I?You actually think
this could work?On me...yes.On Blade,
I'm not so sure.See, he didn't
contract vampirismfrom a bite
like I did.He was born with it.It's... it's part
of his DNA.I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,but its gonna
take time.Ah, we're out of time.You saw what was
on that disc.Damn.Get out of here.I said get out of here!Nice place.Took us a while
to find it!Bite me
and get it over with.I ain't gonna bite you.Do your thing.Whistler.Ohh.Frost took her.Listen to me.The disc.He decoded it.Frost is trying to...trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.There's some kind of...Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.La Magra.You're the key.He needs
your blood.The blood
of the daywalker.You're the chosen one.Listen to me, Blade.You can't
go after him.Bullshit.If Frost gets
his hands on you,it's all over.There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.Shit.You're gonna have
to finish me off.Don't want me
coming back.We can treat
the wounds.It's too far gone.You know that.Give me your gun.No.Give me
the god-damn gun.Now walk away,you stupid
son of a bitch.Walk the fuck away.By the time you watch this,your friend Whistler
should be dead.If it makes any
difference to you,he put up
quite a fight.You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.You seem a bit...tense.A bit pent-up maybe,like you need to
release something.You know?Blade not...givin' it to you
maybe.I don't know.
I just...I see such
a beautiful woman.Great skin.I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?Well, it's either that
or a body bag.Go ahead.Bite me.I'll just cure myself.I did it before,and I can do it again.There is no cure,
baby.There is if you've
been bit,if you were once human.How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?A born vampirewould have the power
to regenerate from birth.You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.Isn't that right?Vampires like you
aren't a species.You're just... infected,
a virus...a sexually transmitted
disease.I'll tell you
what we are, sister.We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,you people
are fuckin' history.He's a hurricane,an act of God.Anyone caught
in his pathwill instantly
be turned.Everyone you've
ever known,everyone you've ever
fucking loved.It won't matter
who's purebloodand who's not.How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?Hmm?And Blade's blood
is the key.We got an intruder.Deac, I don't think
you understand.I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?He's, like, he had
20 guys around him...and he's got shit
he throws at you...Yeah, the swords.Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.Yeah. Shut the fuck up!There's no
intruder where we are.Look, make it happen,
all right?It's one guy on foot.That's him!
Get him!Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?I need him alive.No!Please!I just work for them!Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.Yes, sir!Aah!Aieee!
Aah!Eric?But you died.I came back, Eric.That very same night...when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.Uhh!Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.You're finally being
reunited with your mother,and you act like this?Blade, give it up.
It's over.She belongs to me,
buddy.Uh! Uhh!Don't look so surprised.You spent your whole lifelooking for the vampire
who bit your mother.Well, here I am.Who would ever guessyou'd survive
your mother's death?But you did.And here we are...one big happy
fuckin' family.I need my serum.Maybe when we
get outta this,I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.There's one catch.If it works,you'll lose
your strengthand your ability
to regenerate.You'll be
completely human.Uhh!Blade, Karen,glad you could make it.Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.Our ancestors
called this placethe Temple
of Eternal Night.Nice, isn't it?Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.Fortunately for us...I'm what you
might call a...student of history.Why are we here?This temple was built
for one glorious moment...this night,
for the Blood God.Thanks.Let's see
this sword of yours.Well.Titanium, right?Acid-etched?I'll get used
to a weapon like this.What?You look surprised.I told you, Blade,I know everything
about you.Hold out your arm,
Quinn.Why, man?These are... they're,
like, all better.Hold out your arm.Now.Deac, l...Just kidding.Ha ha ha ha!
He was fuckin'
with me.He was, like,
fuckin'...Blade.Blade.He can't hear you,
honey.The thirst has

What do you want to hear, Amber?</i>"Shake a Tail Feather"
by The Five Du-Tones.Here they are, The Five Du-Tones.<i>I heard about the fella
You've been dancin' with</i><i>All over the neighborhood</i><i>So why didn't you ask me, baby?</i><i>Or didn't you think I could?</i><i>I know that the Bossa Nova's
Outta sight</i><i>I've seen him do

Let me see you shake a tail feather</i><i>Twistin'! Shake-it, shake-it, shake-it
Shake-it, baby</i>You should be on
that council, not her.I know I should, Penny.
Hey, I'm going to that hop tonight.Oh, let me come. We'll lie and say
we're going to the library to study.- It's a deal, heh.
- Heh.- We'll meet 8:00, up on the avenue.
- Heh.Okay, young ladies. I've had just
about enough of this screeching music.Mother, we're watching
<i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>Penny,
your mother called all frantic.She said you are punished.I'm always punished.And Tracy, I have told
you about that hair...all ratted up like
a teenage Jezebel.Oh, Mother,
you're so '50s.Tracy's flamboyant flip
is all the rage, Miss Edna.Jackie Kennedy, our first lady,
even rats her hair.But Tracy ain't no
first lady, are you, Tracy?No, sirree, she's a hairhopper.
That's what she is.Now, I've got nothing but
hampers of ironing to do...and my diet pill is wearing off.Tracy, I want you to go
to your room and study.And Penny,
don't you be listening...to every bit of nonsense
my daughter tells you.If I didn't know better,
I'd swear she was mental.Now what? More soiled laundry
for Mommy, I suppose.Come in.Edna, have you seen Penny?Good Lord, Prudy,
she's right over there.Hi, Mom.Penny Pingleton,
you know you were punished.From now on, you're wearing a giant P
on your blouse every day to school...so that the whole world knows that
Penny Pingleton is permanently...positively punished.Eight o'clock.- Bye, Miss Edna.
- Bye, honey.I said no.- Oh, stop. Stop, unh.
- What is it? What is it?Unh, oh, my God.- Amber, what's the matter?
- No, get off of me.- Don't look at me.
- Whoa, what's the matter? Amber.What's the matter?I happen to have a blemish.You had three good
close-ups today, period.Why can't you dance up front
where the voters can see you?Leave me alone, Mother.
I have a pimple.Heh, you had to choose a colored
record as your favorite song?That's nice for the neighbors.You got something against
Connie Francis?Shelley Fabares?- I love Shelley Fabares.
- Oh.Amber, Amber.Are you listening to me?We have to have a little talk.You know, if your father is
forced to integrate Tilted Acres...we're out of business.So at least act
white on television.Leave me alone, Mother."Shake a Tail Feather"
is a wild song.It's got a good beat
and you can dance to it.Oh, God, of all nights.A Corny Collins record hop,
and I've got craters.Unh, just pop it. Pop it.Just relax. Relax.Don't be ridiculous.
Take it easy.Tension is the worst thing
for a complexion.Come on. Lie down. Lie down.No moping.Mother is here.You have beautiful skin, Amber.There. It's gone.<i>Now it's time for you-know-what</i>Mother, I know all the dances.Come on. Get up. Get up.- Practice makes perfect.
- Ugh.I ought to know.Don't forget, I was
Miss Soft Crab in 1945.And that title wasn't handed to me
on a silver platter. I worked for it.Now come on. A one, two,
a one, two, three, pony.Mash potatoes.Faster.Amber, I'd like to talk to you.Yes, Daddy?Don't stop. Cha-cha.- I'm tired.
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.One, two, cha-cha-cha.I had some new campaign fliers made up
today, all for Daddy's little girl.Now, I want you to hand those out
at the hop tonight to everyone.Each and every one of those.- Twist.
- Oh, Daddy, ugh.No lip from you, Miss ingrate.This campaign is costing us
an arm and a leg.New gowns,
hairdresser three times a week.Your hairspray bill alone is enough to eat
up all the profits from the Tilt-A-Whirl.Do as Daddy says or we'll send you
to Catholic school where you belong.- Right, Franklin?
- That's right. Catholic school.Pass the macaroni
and cheese, please.Did you take that appetite suppressant
I gave you on Dr. McKenzie's orders?Mother, I'm a growing teenager.
I need food.Let her eat, Edna.Tracy, did you do your chores
around the house today?Not Miss Tracy,
Cyd Charisse herself.She's too busy ratting her hair
and doing the Ubangi stomp.Tracy, we all have
responsibilities in life.You may think owning the Hardy
Har joke shop is all drudgery...unwrapping dribble glasses,
checking doggie doo inventory...but I love it.You'll see. Work can be fun.Can I please be excused to go
to the library to study?<i>Let's have a ball
at the hall tonight</i><i>Boot it girl till
the early bright</i><i>Make a scene with the record machine
At the dancin' party tonight</i><i>Come on let's try
mashed potatoes too</i>What's the problem, officer?- This is a white establishment.

Tracy. We'll see you tomorrow.Now, Motormouth, I think it's time
we slowed things down a little...with Mr. Gene Pitney.You can't hide your face
in this godforsaken place.Here in your own city,
there's a town without pity, heh.Gene Pitney,
ladies and gentlemen.<i>When you're young and so and love

little something we call the spotlight.Okay. First girl, Miss Pingleton?Uh, I'm just a little nervous.This is show business, young lady.If you think you're
nervous now, ha.Wait till you're on the air.Okay, first question?Are you now, or have
you ever gone steady?Well, I'm not going with anybody now,
but I'd love to date a Council Member.- Pfft. She wishes.
- Yeah, right.Come on.Exactly how many
sweaters do you have?Gee, I never counted.I guess about five.Five?Next.Nadine Carver,
Eastern High School.Are you aware Negro Day is the
last Thursday of every month?Yes, I've been on it a few times.I feel the show should be
integrated every day.Can you relate
to Lesley Gore's music?Look, she ain't no James Brown...but I can dance to
Lawrence Welk if I have to.Lawrence Welk?Thank you, Nadine.Tracy Turnblad.Would you do a pimple cream
commercial on camera...if Corny asked you to?I'd be proud to.Luckily, I've never been cursed
with acne like others.But I realize the devastating
effect of skin blemishes...on the social life of teenagers.Would you ever, heh, swim in
an integrated swimming pool, heh?Oh, my God.- I certainly would, Iggy.
- Heh.I'm a modern kind of girl.I'm all for integration.Ugh, aren't you a little fat
for the show?That's enough, Amber.I would imagine that many home viewers
are also pleasantly plump or chunky.Oh, come on. The show's
not filmed in CinemaScope, heh.You're out of line, Amber.- Ow.
- Corny, Tammy, can't you see?- This girl's a trash can.
- That's five demerit points.You're suspended from the show today.
Pack your things. Go home.Oh, my God.- I was supposed to lead ladies' choice.
- I'm sure we can find a replacement.- Yes, Corny.
- Please, wait outside.The Council will now meet in secret,
debate your personality flaws...and come to a final decision.Miss Edna!Miss Edna!Penny Pingleton,
you'll wake the dead.Tracy's not home yet.Plus your mother called
and she's on the warpath.I know, Miss Edna.
Can I come in?Oh, there's something
you have gotta see.Well, yeah, come on up...but I've got ironing
and Wilbur's working.Mr. Turnblad!It's not war with Cuba, is it?- Or more Negro problems?
- No, you'll see.Did poor Debbie Reynolds
have a nervous breakdown?This better be good.Broad daylight and I'm sitting
in front of a TV.I've seen <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>,
thank you.- Just watch.
- I just lost a $2.69 Silly Putty sale.- This better be worth it.
- Wait, you'll see. Just watch.<i>- What's your name?

She's all peroxided up.I'll be damned. Tracy's on TV.With a triple process, yet.But Tracy was accepted
on the Corny Collins Council.Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad,
your daughter's a star.<i>And you, you are my girl</i><i>And no one can hurt you, oh, no</i>See? She's already
getting close-ups.Does she get paid for this?- Big as a house.
- I think she looks pretty, Edna, heh.Hello.Uh, yes, I'm watching her now.You are? Well, thank you, heh.Yes. Good bye.That was Hilda
from up Conklin Street.She's going to send a telegram.Oh, God, there she is.<i>Nothing can stop me, now</i><i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl</i><i>So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>It's time to introduce someone
very special.A new Council Member making
her first appearance on the show...and we already have telegrams.
Introduce yourself.Hi, Corny. I'm Tracy Turnblad
and I go to Mervel High.Well, someone out there likes you."Please, have the new girl
lead a ladies' choice."I was supposed to lead
the ladies' choice.<i>- Tell me, Tracy, are you going steady?
- No, I'm not.</i><i>But there is somebody
I've got a crush on.</i>Who, I'd like to know?
She's just a child.<i>Well, let's see who
the lucky guy is.</i><i>Ladies and gentlemen,
a ladies' choice.</i>Hi, Tracy. It's me, Penny.She can't hear you.She better hadn't dare.<i>If you should lose me</i><i>Oh, yeah</i><i>You'll lose a good thing</i><i>If you should lose me</i><i>Oh, yeah</i><i>You'll lose a good thing</i><i>You know I love you</i><i>Do anything for you</i>Ugh, oh, God. He's violated the
oath of the friendship ring.Oh, don't cry, honey.<i>You'll lose a good thing</i><i>I'm givin' you one more chance</i><i>For you to do right</i><i>If you'll only straighten up
We'll have a good life</i>That fat girl's no competition.White trash, plain and simple.For all we know,

I'm big, blond and beautiful.You're a teen leader now.And the show biz offers
are pouring in.Tonight we have an audition.
Honey, this is only the beginning.Stick with me and we'll
claw our way to the top.Oh, God.Fame, fortune, glamour.And to top it off...- ...I'm in love.
- Oh.Wow, Tracy, you're really tough.Oh, ooh, Tracy, what do
you think about this one?- I like it.

- Hi.Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business
manager, Edna Turnblad.Well, it's a pleasure
to meet the both of you.Here, we cater to big-boned gals
like yourself who are stylish...and at the same time frustrated
by the lack of sizes in stores today.I saw you on TV.
I want you to be my model.Would, uh...?
Would she be paid for this?One free outfit a month.You start tomorrow. I hope
there's no diets in the works...because I want to design your Miss
Auto Show coronation gown myself.Could, uh, could you throw a pair of
complimentary pettipants in the deal?You drive a hard bargain,
Miss Edna, and rightfully so.Pettipants, pettigirdle,
you just let Tracy take her pick.How about a fabulous
frock just for me?Tracy has to work one
extra day for free.It's a deal.- Thank you, Mr. Pinky.
- Ha-ha-ha.I'm going to make you a star.I hope your father likes this.He'll love it. You look beautiful.
It's the new you.Oh, mom, come on. Come on.- Go in the beauty shop?

segment AB and line segment CD...are chords of the circle.Line segment PA
and line segment PC...What is the problem, Mr. Davis?I can't see through her hair.I can't help it if he's short.Your ratted hair is preventing yet
another student's geometry education.It's feathered, not ratted.Whatever you call it,
it's a hair-don't.You've been warned repeatedly.I want you to take a little walk
down to the principal's office.Let's see what he has to say.Anyway, she was right in the car...in plain sight of
just everybody at the hop.She was nude.- No.
- That fat thing?Tracy Turnblad is a whore.Happy now?- But, Mom, I didn't do...
- Don't "but, Mom" me.- I didn't. He's lying. Ow!
- You are suspended.- What was that for?
- Give you something to whine about.Miss Turnblad?Have a seat.Yes, sir.Once again, your hairdo
is getting you in hot water.Didn't two weeks in hairdo
detention have any effect?Uh, I happen to be the
height of teen fashion.You're on a one-way ticket
to reform school.Well, I'm afraid we're just going
to have to change your homeroom.Starting today, you report
to class 10-D, room 108.Special ed?Yes, Miss Turnblad,
special education.- But that's for retards.
- Mm.And the black kids
you try to hold back.Here, you will be taught
by specialists...trained to deal with hairdo
scofflaws in high-school society.Mr. Davidson.That will be all, Miss Turnblad.The city of Baltimore
has an interesting Catholic history.It was named after Lord Baltimore.He founded the Maryland
colony for Catholics...and others who could not practice
their religion in England.Hey, don't touch my stuff.
I'll kick your ass.Take it back.Teach us how to dance, honey.Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go...Good morning, class.Good morning, Mrs. Shipley.Now let's all stand and say

Maybelle herself.I'm Seaweed.Hey, Penny, see the colored boy,
the cute one?His mother is Motormouth Maybelle.He's gorgeous.I'll get the fat retard.- Game over! Let's hit the showers.

- What?You know, black and white,
salt and pepper.Well, yes, I'm a
checkerboard chick, I guess.Whoa! Whoa!Phew!- I'm an integrationist.
- Yeah.We shall overcome someday.Not with that hair, you won't.You look like a hairhopper to me.I mean,
your hair is really uncool.How do you get your hair
so straight and so flat?With an iron, man.I play my bongos, listen to Odetta,
and then I iron my hair. Dig?I think we'd better get going now.
The coast looks clear.Let's do some reefer. We'll get high
and I'll iron the chicks' hair.Reefer? Oh.Drugs?Locoweed.When I'm high, I am Odetta.Let's get naked and smoke.Cool.Don't breathe it in.
You'll be addicted.Later, sister, later.
Much later.<i>I saw the best minds of my generation
Destroyed by madness</i><i>Starving, hysterical, naked

And sat up smoking in the...</i>- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Dad?Don't "hi, Dad" me.
The whole world saw you on the news.Penny, this is Dr. Frederickson.He's a psychiatrist, and he's
going to make you all better.Feeling depressed, Penny?
Want to talk about it?Think of all the white boys in school
and how much you'd like to date one.Be a good little girl
and slip this on.Shock treatments are the answer.- Come here, Penny.
- What are you doing?Good girl. Good girl.- I love you, Seaweed!
- Shut up!- Get her in the car.
- It'll be all right. Get her, doc, quick.Prudy,
this is totally unnecessary.Come on, honey. Time to go home.
You can see Link tomorrow.We've been worried sick about you.
This neighborhood's no place for a star.Get in that car before
someone sees you.<i>Tilted acres is not fair!</i><i>Racist people everywhere!</i><i>Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!</i>- Get out of here.
- Go back where you belong.Well, personally,
I have nothing against them.It's merely a matter of economics.Tilted Acres
will never be integrated.- Segregation today.
- Segregation tomorrow.Segregation forever.Hey.One black face gets on camera,
this show's off the air.The kids don't care
if blacks dance on the show.This is ripping the city apart.Motormouth Maybelle is
out there, and she's our friend.We've done hops together for years.
The kids love her.<i>The Corny Collins Show</i>
remains white.Or you're all fired.Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome
to <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>Yes, we are live from Tilted Acres.Hop in the car,
bring the whole family, come out.Right now I want to introduce
to you the top contenders...in the Miss Auto Show contest,
Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad.I understand you're both going to
introduce a new dance in the show today.Yes, I am, Corny.
It's called the Limbo Rock.And I bet some people will
find it quite difficult.Here it is, the Limbo Rock.<i>Every limbo boy and girl</i><i>All around the limbo world</i><i>Gonna do the limbo rock</i><i>All around the limbo clock</i><i>Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick</i><i>Jack, go under limbo stick</i><i>All around the limbo clock</i><i>Hey, let's do the limbo rock</i>Good afternoon, Penny.Feeling better?Getting in touch with your anger?Go, Tracy, go!<i>Limbo ankle, limbo knee
Bend back like a limbo tree</i><i>Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick</i><i>Jack, go under limbo stick</i>I watch that tramp
and I'm embarrassed to be white.You know, Edna,
I've been reading about these kids.Maybe Tracy could be
some sort of campus leader.Wilbur, it's the times.They're a-changing.Something's blowing in the wind.Fetch me my diet pills,
would you, hon?<i>Get yourself a limbo girl</i>Go back to Africa where you came from.
Your kind's not wanted here.Baltimore, you saw it here first.
The Limbo Rock.Thank you very much, Amber.- I'm a winner, Corny.
- Well, Amber, you won the dance...but let's check the election
results to see how you're doing.We have an upset.For the first time, Tracy Turnblad
is number one with a bullet.What do you have to say
for yourself, Tracy?If elected, I plan to
represent all of Baltimore.Today I'd like to introduce
a brand-new dance...and dedicate it to some
of my special friends...who, because of small-minded people,
can't be here with me today.My dance is called the Waddle.That girl's got
roaches in her hair.Roaches?My little Tracy's a clean teen.There's no bugs on our baby.I'm not kidding.
I just saw one.Amber,
you're such a comedian, heh.Ladies and gentlemen,
Tracy Turnblad and the Waddle.You all make me sick.- Tammy.
- What is going on here?- Look, we had nothing to do with it.
- It isn't our fault.Seaweed, come on.Seaweed.Tracy, just keep dancing.Move it around here.
What, are you crazy?Come on. Move out.That's why I would like
to humbly state...Daddy. Mommy. Daddy.
Mommy. Daddy.- There's a riot going on.
- A riot?- A race riot.
- A race...?- Yo, I'm talking to you.
- Look, I have no...Everybody just stay calm.
Stay calm...You leave my boyfriend alone,
you witch.- You scum!

colored people in my house!I'm gonna make a citizen's arrest.Stop! Stop!- Paddy, stop them.

at Montrose.- She is a hairhopper.
- A what?- Free Tracy Turnblad!

grassroots support.You keep the goddamn cops away

for our vast television audience.Voters are demanding answers
right here at the governor's mansion.This demonstration's gonna turn nasty.

saved our very sanity.Dmitri...we have this little problem.Every search for a hero...must begin with something
that every hero requires- -a villain.Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,we created a monster, Chimera.I beg you, Dmitri,come to Sydney and accompany me
to Atlanta immediately.However we travel,
I must arrive at my destination...within 20 hours of departure.I fear I can entrust this
to no one but you.Dmitri, as we say,
I'm sorry and you're sorry.Do you have any idea
what the hell he's talking about?- An idea? Yeah.
- Like?Like it's a good idea
to pick him up in a hurry...and a bad idea to fly him
on a commercial carrier.- Is he still in Sydney?
- Dr. Vladimir Nekhovich is dead.So is his colleague Gradski,
but that happened earlier.We had Nekhovich on a flight from
Sydney that crashed in the Rockies.- Dead?
- Are you listening to me?If he didn't want
to go anywhere without me,how did you get him
on that flight?Oh, you were there.When I couldn't find you,
I had to replace you.Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.Now, he doubled you, what,
two or three times?- Twice.
- What did you think of him?We had our reservations
about each other.Isn't it a little late
to be asking me that?No, not necessarily.
Airline records...list a Captain Harold Macintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.As far as the media and all
government agencies are concerned,Captain Macintosh
died on the flight.But in fact, he missed it.He did, however,
make the next flight...in cargo.Stuffed into a rather small suitcase,
considering his size.Now, someone on that flight
planned an operation...designed to bring the plane down
and make it look like an accident.Someone skillful enough to bring
the whole thing off without a hitch.So there's one thing we know
that Ambrose doesn't.You do think it was Ambrose?
You're not surprised?Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.The question is why? What was this,
uh, Chimera, Nekhovich was carrying?Only Ambrose knows that.In any case, you must recover this- -
whatever- - Chimera, and bring it to us.In order to do that, I have to figure
out how he plans to make money with it.That is where Miss Hall comes in.Excuse me?Miss Hall and Ambrose
had a relationship...which he took very seriously.She walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.We believe she's our surest
and quickest way of locating him.And then what?Well, make sure
she continues to see him,gets him to confide in her,
and report to you.You made it sound as if I was recruiting
her for her skills as a thief.Well, then I misled you,
or you made the wrong assumption.Either way, we're asking her
to resume a prior relationship,not do anything
she hasn't already done.Voluntarily, I might add.No, she's got no training
for this kind of thing.What, to go to bed with a man
and lie to him? She's a woman.She's got all
the training she needs.I don't think
I can get her to do it.- You mean it'll be difficult.
- Very.Well, this is not Mission Difficult,
Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible.Difficult should be
a walk in the park for you.I'm open to suggestion.If you can think of a quicker way,
you're welcome to try.By the way, You might take a look at these...if you have any further qualms
about getting her to do the job.<font color="#D900D9">(WOMAN VOCALIZING)</font>How many people are capable
of something like that?Sean Ambrose, for one.Right.This wasn't what
I had in mind, Nyah.But it is what you'd
like me to do.What? Oh, let my conscience
be my guide, is that it?Something like that.I don't have a conscience.
I'm a bloody thief.Are you gonna try
and force me to do this?Generally, I don't favor
coercing someone,not when there's a chance
my life could end up in their hands.- Is that the only reason?
- Can you think of a better one?Me? No.
But I was just hoping that you might,thinking that somewhere, this got
personal as well as physical!OK, OK Would it make you feel any better
if I didn't want you to do this?- Yeah, much.
- Then feel better!You know, Sean will never
be anything but suspicious...if I pitch up saying,
"Hey, honey, I'm home. "What wouldn't
make him suspicious?That I needed him
in some urgent way.Destitute.

- A visit from an old friend.<font color="#D900D9">(PANTING)</font> You crashed on the plane.
You're dead.Dead, certainly.
But dead is a little extreme.On the other hand, when my colleague
Gradski had your pulse...and your blood pressure,
he had less than a day to live.You are infected with Chimera,
my friend.No use, my friend.The medical staff
wants no part of this.Doctors don't fancy the idea
of dying any more than anybody else.How could I possibly be infected?That's exactly what Gradski said
27 hours before he died.You've got the antidote,
you miserable bastard!- You stole Bellerophon! All of it!
- My, my, my.I need it! I need it now,
you whacked- out Russian Gypsy!And what about Gradski, who you
deliberately infected with Chimera?How was I to know they needed...to be treated with Bellerophon
within 20 hours?- By asking me.
- You still don't get it, do you?I needed to know just how bad
the disease was in the real world,not just the lab.You were genetically splicing
together strains of influenza...to create a cure for all influenzas.But you were also creating
a disease so terrible in Chimera,the cure would be priceless.I needed Chimera in order
to peddle Bellerophon.It's not that difficult
to understand, is it?Look, I've got the virus.
You've got the cure.I need them both.Time was a shot of penicillin
would knock off...every bloody bug in the zoo.
Not anymore.If I couldn't make money killing
the microscopic little shits out there,well, you'd help me put one out
there that I could make money on.Well, there it is.
I've confessed.I, John C. McCloy,am in business to make money.Now, forget any deal you may have
made with that thug Ambrose.Get me treated,
and let's go back to work.You know,I think it's a little late for that.Do give my regards to Gradski...if you see him.Well...I've heard...<font color="#808080">NORMAL VOICE :</font>

to alarm Ambrose.What?You told me to get out of there
as soon as possible.- I thought you were here to collect me!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!Listen to me.
There's no time to talk.It is critical,
absolutely critical,that you do whatever Ambrose asks.Do you understand me?Don't worry.It will all be over...
very soon.<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>

without a disease,and we're home free.You were right.

Touch of the flu.- Is the building up and running yet?
- Mmm.- That's not exactly it.
- Sorry, but this is a Biocyte facility.Their storage structure.
I'll have it up in a minute.- Okay, take a look at this.
- Start from the inside out.All storage and production
of Chimera is done here,in this lab on the 42ndfloor.Hunt's target will be the Chimera,stored and manufactured
at Biocyte on the 42nd floor.If you look at Hunt's
operational history, and I have,he invariably favors
misdirection over confrontation.He'll never break into Biocyte from
the bottom where security is heaviest.No garage entrances.Lobby's protected by five guards
on rotating patrol.Not goin' in from the ground.
Show me the atrium.The atrium?
One of a kind.Runs down through the center
of the building.Provides 24- hournaturallight via
mirrors and daylight storage cells.Optimal growing conditions
for the virus.Ends in a glass floor which doubles
as part of the lab ceiling.Uh- uh. The atrium roof
closes at sundown.And if the louvers are up for
more than 40seconds at night,the civil emergency alarms
are tripped.Those, even I can't stop.Ethan, we have
a total of 40 seconds...to get you in
and the cables out.No, Hunt will prefer to enter
Biocyte somewhere from the top...where security is minimal.He'll undoubtedly engage
in some aerobatic insanity...before he'll risk harming a hair
on a security guard's head.- Check- check. Got copy?

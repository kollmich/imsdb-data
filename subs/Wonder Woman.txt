precious thing in the world to me.I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myselfand begged Zeus to give you life.You've told me this story.Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.A story of our people,
and my days of battle.Yes!So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.Long ago, when time was newand all of history was still a dream,<i>the Gods ruled the Earth,</i><i>Zeus king among them.</i><i>Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule.</i><i>Beings born in his image,</i><i>fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankindand sought to corrupt
his father's creation.<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.<i>He turned them against one another</i><i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i><i>So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,</i><i>to influence men's hearts with love</i><i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i><i>And for a brief time, there was peace.</i><font color="#FF5500"><b>ANTIOPE</b></font> : <i>But it did not last.</i><i>Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt</i><i>that freed us all from enslavement.</i><i>When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,</i><i>Ares killed them one by one,</i><i>until only Zeus himself remained.</i><font color="#FF5500"><b>HIPPOLYTA</b></font> : <i>Zeus used the last of his power
to stop Ares,</i><i>striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat.</i><i>But Zeus knew</i><i>that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission.</i><i>An endless war,</i><i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,</i><i>and us with them.</i><font color="#FF5500"><b>ANTIOPE</b></font> : <i>So Zeus left us a weapon,</i><i>one powerful enough to kill a God.</i><font color="#FF5500"><b>HIPPOLYTA</b></font> : <i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island</i><i>to hide us from the outside world,</i><i>somewhere Ares could not find us.</i><i>And all has been quiet ever since.</i>We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.And the Godkiller?The Godkiller?The weapon that's strong enough
to kill a god.<i>Can I see it?</i>The Gods gave us many gifts.One day, you'll know them all.This great tower is where we keep them.The Godkiller.<i>It's beautiful.</i>Who would wield it?I pray it will never be called to arms.But only the fiercest among us
even could.And that is not you, Diana.You see, you're safe,and there is nothing
you should concern yourself with.<b><font color="#ffff00">(METAL CLANGING)</font></b><b><font color="#ffff00">(BOTH GRUNTING)</font></b>You keep doubting yourself, Diana.- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.No, I don't.You are stronger than you believe.<i>You have greater powers than you know.</i><i>- But if you don't try hard...</i>
- <font color="#FF5500"><b>HIPPOLYTA</b></font> : <i>Diana!</i>Are you hurt?No, Mother, I'm fine,- I was justâ
- Training.It seems I'm not
the revered queen I should be.Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to...Take her to the palace.Off you go.You left me no choice, Hippolyta.You neglect your duty
if she cannot fight.You speak of a time that may never come.He might never return.He could have died from his wounds.Ares is alive.You feel it, as I do, in your bones.It is only a matter of time
before he returns.The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.Hippolyta, I love her as you do.But this is the only way
to truly protect her.<b><font color="#ffff00">(SIGHS)</font></b>You will train her harder than
any Amazon before her.<i>Five times harder,</i><i>ten times harder.</i><i>Until she is better than even you.</i><i>But she must never know the truth</i><i>about what she is</i><i>or how she came to be.</i><b><font color="#ffff00">(PANTING)</font></b><b><font color="#ffff00">(GRUNTING)</font></b><b><font color="#ffff00">(BOTH GRUNTING)</font></b>Harder.<i>- You're stronger than this, Diana.</i>

installation in the Ottoman Empire.</i><i>I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them.</i><i>According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,</i><i>no money, no munitions of any kind.</i><i>But our intel was wrong.</i><i>The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them.</i><i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i><i>Secret weapons.</i><i>Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru.</i><i>The boys in the trenches

looted and burned.</i><b><font color="#ffff00">(GROANS)</font></b> Weapons far deadlier than you can<b><font color="#ffff00">(EXHALES)</font></b>ever imagine.It's like nothing I've ever seen.<i>It's like the world's going to end.</i>Should we let him go?And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?We cannot hold him forever, my queen.Mother. Excuse me,but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares.What are you talking about, child?Forgive me, Senator,
but the man called it "a war without end."Millions of people already dead.Like nothing he's ever seen.Only Ares could do such a thing.We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.I will not deploy our army
and leave Themyscira defenselessto go and fight their war.It is not their war.Zeus created man to be
just and wise, strong and passionate...That was a story, Diana!There is much you do not understand.Men are easily corrupted.Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!It is Ares who has
these Germans fighting.<i>And stopping the God of War

from the Alps to the North Sea.Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.Ares? As in, the God of War?The God of War is our responsibility.

will be freed from his influenceand they will be good men again,

<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>Did you bring any of those with you?You would not enjoy them.I don't know. Maybe.<i>No, you wouldn't.</i>Why not?They came to the conclusion that men

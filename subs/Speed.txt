SpeedHey, this area's restricted.Oh, hi. Yeah, I know.
They called me down here.Some of this wiring
got screwed up.Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.Yeah. Just a second.There you are.Nothing personal.<i>- I guess that wraps
it up. Good work, everybody. </i>Marty, I couldn't be happier with the way this worked out.- Congratulations.
- Good for you.Oh, hold that.Whoa.Gee, thanks.Thanks for pushing that, Bob.
The light's on.- But you never know. It really might be broken.
- Shut up.So remember, honey...<i>- No! Please!</i>Jesus. Bob,
what button did you push?<i>Peter! Come on!</i><i>Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other
elevators remain locked down and empty. </i>- Yes, sir.
- Now, there's no other way, no doors...no other way in or out
except through access panels.- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.Bomb's already taken out cables. Bomber wants
$3 million, or he blows the emergency brakes.<i>- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour. </i>- That leaves 23 minutes exactly.
- Anything else that'll keep this elevator from falling?- The basement.
- The city would like to avoid that event, Officer Traven.<i>- We can't just unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator. </i>The only way in or out
is through access panels.The bomber's also wired
the hatch to trigger the bomb,<i>which seats him in the crazy
but not stupid section. </i>Sir, Harry volunteers
to examine the device.Yeah, right.<i>Fine. The two of you
check it out. </i><i> The nearest access
panel's on the 32nd floor in the lobby. </i><i>I want reports only.
We're in a holding pattern. </i>Worthy and Briggs, I want you to secure
the base area. No one in or out.Everyone else, I want you
to affirm building evac. Move!Looks like we're walkin'.<i>Hurry, folks, but watch your step.
- Twenty-nine!</i>All the way down to the lobby!
Let's go, folks!Thirty!Thirty-one!Thirty-two.<i>- Hello?
- What's going on?</i><i>- Come on, man. Get us out of here!
- Hello?</i><i>- What's that?
- Hello!</i><i>Please help us!</i><i> Help! Please!
Get us out of here!</i><i>Please!</i><i>Please, get us out of here!</i><i>Who's up there?</i><i>Who's up there?
What's going on?</i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the L.A.P.D.- Thank God!
- What are you doing up there?<i> There has been an elevator
malfunction, so just relax. </i><i> Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?</i>We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.Am I lying?How come they sent
cops here?Shouldn't they send
repair guys?<i>- Yeah.
- Doesn't make any sense. </i>What do you think?- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.<i>- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognize the work, but he's a pro. </i>Oh, he's cuttin' it close.I don't like it.<i>Yeah, well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold. </i><i>All right, pop quiz.
The airport. </i>Gunman with one hostage.
He's usin' her for cover.He's almost to a plane.
You're a hundred feet away.Jack.Shoot the hostage.What?Take her
out of the equation.Go for the good wound, and
he can't get to the plane with her.<i>- Clear shot.
- You're deeply nuts. You know that?</i><i>"Shoot the hostage. "
Geez. </i>Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.<i>Why?</i>I don't know.
Gut feeling.Well, right now Mac
outranks your gut, so we sit.This is taking way too long.How much you think
that elevator weighs?<i>Jack, come on. </i>Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.We're not gonna
shoot 'em, right?<i> Hey, where are you going?
What's going on?</i><i>Don't go! Don't leave us here!</i>No, we just take them
out of the equation.- You sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.Six minutes.I can't get any more time.
He's not talkin'!I need
the goddamn money now!Tell me again, Harry.
Why did I take this job?Aw, come on. Thirty more years of this, you
get a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.Cool. Whoa!<i>- God, it's hot in here.
- There's no air. </i><i>- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe. </i>Don't fuck with Daddy.Oh, my God! Oh, my God!Oh, my God!- Oh, my God! What's happening?
- Grab her hand!Usually they fall down now.Get her up!He's early.
The son of a bitch is early.Mac, we need
more help up here now!- Oh, please open the door!
- I don't wanna die! Please!<i>- Save me! I wanna get out!
- Open the door!</i>- Please help me!
- Joan, get back! We'll get you out!Give me your hands!- It's okay. Give me your hands.
- Pull me through!- Oh, God!
- Watch your head. Watch your head.- Help me!
- Okay, I've got you. I've got you.- Take it easy!
- You're fine.- Oh, thank you!
- You're fine.- Take her. Okay, let's go! Next!
- Okay, lady, come on.- Thank you. Oh.
- I've got you, ma'am.Just move back, please.What the hell is all this?Help us! Hurry!<i>Hurry! Hurry! Let's go!
Go! Go! Let's go!</i><i>- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on! Come on!</i>- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Come on.- Help me out! Please help me out!
- Watch your head.- Come on, lady! Come on!
- No.Come on, lady! Come on!
Grab my hand! Come on!<i>- Go! - There's one more.
Can you get her out?</i>Come on.
Come on, let's go!<i>- No. No, I can't!
- It's going to fall. </i>Just take one step,
reach out and take my hand.<i>- Come on!
- Hurry!</i><i>Come on!</i>Oh, God! Don't let go of me!You're okay.- Great God!
- Oh, my shoe!Let's go, let's go!<i>Was it good for you?</i>Oh, it was great for me.
How was it for you, honey?- Elevator dropped.
- Oh, good. That's good to know.- Is your watch slow?
- Uh-uh. No, no. He jumped the gun.- We had three minutes left.
- Why does he do that?He's losing
his three million.I don't know. Maybe he
couldn't hold his wad long enough.It's a common problem among
middle-aged men. So I'm told.He's here.He could've blown
that thing from Pacoima.No. He knew we were up
to something. He's close by.<i>He's not gonna corner
himself in a building. </i><i>We evacuated anyway.
Come on. </i>All right. He'd want to be here,
but he'd want to stay mobile, right?<i>The elevators. </i>The passenger cars were stopped.
They checked them out.What about
the freight elevators?Will the mystery guest
please sign in?What?Jack. Damn it!Get to the floor!<i>Shit! Shit! Shit!</i>Up! Get your ass up!I don't suppose anybody'll give
me three million just for you.Hold it!<i>Pop quiz, hot shot.
Terrorist holding a police hostage. </i>Got enough dynamite strapped
to his chest to blow a building in half.Now, what do you do?There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.Oh, standard flanking
deployment, right?Well, maybe we'll get off
on the third floor, huh?At least that's
what they'll think.I want location
of those goddamn shots!Briggs,
where's Jack and Harry?Lieutenant, we've got movement
on the freight elevator.It's on three.
Let's move!End of the line. This day has been
real disappointing, I don't mind saying.Why, because you didn't
get to kill everyone?There will come a time, boy,
when you'll wish you'd never met me.Mister, I'm already there.But, you see, I'm in charge here.
I drop this stick, huh,and they pick your friend up
with a sponge.- Are you ready to die, friend?
- Fuck you.Oh! In 200 years,
we've come from..."I regret but I have one life to give
for my country" to "Fuck you"?- Go ahead, drop the stick. Do it.
- Shut up, Harry.Aw, we've got all the balls
in the world right here, man!Give it up!
You got nowhere to go!Shoot the hostage.Say good-bye, Harry.You fuck!Freeze!Freeze! Give it up!
You're out of options!Through dedication and bravery,
these next two officers...effected the rescue
of 13 citizens of this city.Thanks to them, the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb was his own.You shot me.
I can't believe it.They're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little prick.Harry, you told me to.<i>The Medal of Valor is the highest honor for
a member of Los Angeles Police Department. </i><i>Officer Harry Temple. </i>Congratulations.Officer Jack Traven.Way to go, Jack.
Way to go.<i>- There we go. There we go.
- Harry, my man.</i>Oh, beautiful.
A toast to me.- Make me feel good about myself.
- There you go.Hey, Sandy! Here we go!
Okay, so how we do...<i>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>I need a bib!Here we go. All right.- You can't take me anywhere.
- That's mine.And here is to Harry.<i>For his quick thinking,</i>for his grace
under pressure...and for his brave
and selfless act.- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!And to Jack...
for shooting Harry.Something we've all wanted to do
for a very long time.Hey, hey, hey!Okay, no, no.
Here it is. Here it is.Here's to you guys for doing
your job and for not getting dead.- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.I can't do that.We are the two luckiest guys
in the world, you know that?- We got the bad guy, and we didn't lose any civilians.
- Yeah, we're good.- No, you were lucky.
- No, we were lucky.You'd better understand it.
We were dealing with a total psycho.This guy could've blown us up
at any time. Whew.And I got a bullet in me.Six inches off the mark, and
they're giving the medal to my wife.Harry, come on, man.
I mean, we won, we got him.Do you listen?
Do you ever...Because I am not gonna be
around to back you up,so you'd better
start thinking.Guts will get you so far,
and then they'll get you killed.Luck runs out,
sooner or later.<i>- Right, chief?
- That's right. </i>- Ho!
- I'm all right. I'm all right.I'm gonna go home,
have some sex.Harry, you're gonna
go home and puke.Yeah, well,
that'll be fun too.Come on, you gimp.Hey, Jack, I saw you on TV.
Congratulations.- Thanks, Bob.
- Yeah, you looked fat.Be easy on him, Bob. The boy
was up late last night partying.- A wild party, huh?
- Yeah, well, I don't remember it that well.Couldn't have been too great.
I woke up alone.Yeah? Well, you know,
the last time I partied like that,I woke up married,
huh, Vinnie?Hey, Jack,
you forgot your muffins.- Have a good one, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack. Take care, huh?Thanks.See you tomorrow.<i>Call 9-1-1!</i>What do you think, Jack?You think if you pick up
all the bus driver's teeth,they'll give you
another medal?- Jesus!
- You think I wouldn't have been prepared?Two years I spent
setting up that elevator job.Two years I invested
myself in it.You couldn't understand the kind
of commitment that I have.You ruin a man's life's work,
and you think you can walk away.You got blinders on
to the world.But I got your attention now,
didn't I, Jack?- Why didn't you just come after me?
- No, this is about me.This is about my money.
This is about money due me.Which I will collect.
$3.7 million.It's my nest egg, Jack.
At my age, you gotta think ahead.- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hot shot.There's a bomb on a bus.Once the bus goes 50 miles
an hour, the bomb is armed.If it drops below 50,
it blows up.What do you do?
What do you do!I'd wanna know
what bus it was.You think I'm
gonna tell you that?- Yes.
- Very good.There are rules, Jack, and
I want you to get this right.No one goes off the bus.You try to take any passengers
off the bus, I will detonate it.I want my money by 11:00 a. m.- We can't pull that kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call.The radio's down.
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.It's running downtown
from Venice.It is at the corner
of Ocean Park and Main.<i>Sam! Sam!</i>- Annie.
- Sam!Tell him to stop! Shit!
Excuse me! Comin' through.Sam! God... Shit.Whoa! Stop!- This ain't no bus stop.
- Oh, Sam!<i>- Get rid of your butt, Annie.
- Okay, it's gone, it's gone.</i>You are a good, kind man.One day people will write
songs about you.- Hi.
- Hi.First time in L.A.- Oh, no, I live here.
- No, I mean mine.<i>Oh, that's just funny.
You heard me wrong. </i>- No, I'm sightseein'.
- Oh, really?Yeah, I hate to use the word "tourist,"
but it's not like I can hide it.Not really.Aw, geez, you know, it took me three
hours just to get here from the airport.I got so lost.
L.A. Is one large place.Of course, you live here,
you probably don't notice.- I'm such a yokel. There, I said it.
- Geez.You know what?
I got gum on my seat.Gum!Excuse me.- Morning.
- Hi.Hey! Watch it!I just couldn't handle
the freeways anymore.I got so tense.This way I can just relax
all the way to work.Yeah, well, I love my car.
I miss my car.<i>Oh, God, look at that. </i><i>- Hey, Sam!
- Shit!</i><i>- Sam!
- What?</i>Why don't you just drive over
these people or something?- Don't spit on my bus, Annie.
- Such a mess.Stop!- Open up!
- Get off the door, man! This ain't no bus stop!- That guy really wants to get on the bus.
- Open up! Stop!<i>Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!</i>- L.A.P.D.!
- I can't hear you.- Stop this bus!
- What?<i>L.A.P.D.! Stop the bus!</i>L.A.P.D.!Stop! Stop!Stop! L.A.P.D.!
Get out of the car!Jesus, not again.
This is my car.I own this car.
It's not stolen.- It is now. Move over.
- Fuck! Oh, man.You scratch this puppy, and me and you
are gonna have words, you understand?Okay, look, man, we don't
have to go so fast, all right?Just slow down a little bit,
all right, man? Just slow do...Oh, shit! Oh, come on, man!Just don't tear up my car,
all right? Okay, okay, okay.<i>Just slow down
just a bit, all right?</i>We don't have to go so fast, do we?
I mean, we don't... we don't have to go...That was a nice move,
man. Whoo!Shit, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, shit!<i>The least you could do
is slow down! Come on!</i>Holy shit! Oh, shit!<i>- Oh, shit! What the... </i>Move, move!Is that that guy?Man sure has a hard-on
for this bus.Hey! I'm a cop!- What?
- I'm a cop!L.A.P.D.!
There's a bomb on your bus!<i>- There's a bomb on your bus!
- What?</i>There's a...
What? Fuck!- There's a bomb on your bus!
- Watch the road!Grab that, will ya?
I want you to write on it.I want you to write
on the back, "Bomb on bus. "Write it, write it,
write it!Watch the road!
Oh, shit!Oh, shit! No!Don't slow down!No, no!
No, no, no, no, no!<i>Speed up!</i>Op... Open your door!<i>Open the doors!</i><i>Fifty! Stay above 50!</i><i>- Okay.
- All right?</i>470-8000. Ask for
Detective Harry Temple.Harry.
Harry, it's Jack.Yeah.You'd better not be calling in
sick, 'cause I dragged my ass out of...- Harry, he's alive.
- What?The bomber. He's back.He hit one in Venice already.
Fire chief said there's nothin' left.Temple, we just got a ransom demand
from your dead terrorist.- Says he's rigged a city bus. Where's Jack?
- Where do you think?- I gotta get on that bus.
- You gotta get...Yeah, yeah,
you get on the bus.Drive straight!
Stay in this lane!Watch the road.Wait a minute.
What are you doin'?- Are you insured?
- Yeah. Why?No! No!Ah! Broke my-my door.Sir, I need to take
your phone.- Take the phone.
- Take the wheel.<i>What are you... What?
Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</i>Drive straight!Oh, shit. Whoa, shit!Whoa, shit!Whoa, shit!This guy's out of his mind.This guy's out of his mind.Okay, listen.
You gotta stay above 50.Excuse me.
Are you out of your mind?<i>- Whatever it takes.
- Hello!</i>Everybody,
I'm Jack Traven, L.A.P.D.We have a slight situation on the bus
here. Ma'am, if you'll please sit down...No, I won't sit down. You're scaring
the shit out of these people.Ma'am, please!If everybody will stay
in your seats and remain calm,we should be able
to diffuse the problem.- So sit tight and...
- Get away from me!I don't know you, man. I'm not
here for you. Let's not do this.- Stop the bus! Sit down!
- He can't! Listen...<i>- Stop the bus! Stop it!
- Look, look! Listen!</i>Look, I'm putting
my gun away, okay?Okay?Now, listen.
I don't care about your crime.<i>Whatever you did,
I'm sure that you're sorry. </i>So it's cool now.
It's over.And I'm not a cop right now.See? We're just two
cool guys just hangin' out...<i>No, don't!</i>Sam!I've got the wheel!
I've got it! I've got it!Sam! Oh, God, Sam!<i>Sam, come on,
you gotta move your legs. </i><i>- Somebody move his legs!</i>Sam, get your foot... Sam,
get your foot off the pedal!We gotta stop this thing!No! Don't!
Stay above 50!But Sam's been shot!
We gotta get him off!You slow down,
and this bus'll explode!There is a bomb on this bus.If we slow down, it'll blow.<i>If anyone tries to get off,
it'll explode. </i><i>Bullshit! Yeah, there's a bomb.
Some funny joke, man!</i>Are we gonna have
a problem now?He's bleeding so much, I don't know
what to do. There's so much blood!Put pressure front and back, keep
his legs up and put this under his head.- Hold on, man. Hold on.
- Sam, lift your head.- Miss, can you handle this bus?
- Oh, sure. It's just like driving a really big Pinto.- I need to know, can you handle this bus?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.- Just tell me what the plan is. Is there a plan?
- Just for you to drive.- We're okay for now. Just keep us above 50.
- Good plan.<i>- So, you're a cop, right?
- That's right. </i>Well, I should probably tell you
that I'm taking the bus...because I had
my driver's license revoked.- What for?
- Speeding.Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.If anything changes,
let us know.Anything we haven't seen should be in here.Something wrong with the
driver, that at least one car, a Jaguar,has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.It appears it is somewhere
between Los Angeles...<i>The bus apparently came onto the
freeway at the Lincoln on-ramp. </i><i>It began picking up speed,
swerving and hasn't slowed down since. </i>Minutes ago, a Los Angeles
police officer boarded the bus...<i>by jumping onto it
from a moving car. </i><i>- Oh, would that be you, Jack?
- He doesn't seem to have been able to stop the bus... </i>- Where do we start?
- Check the speedometer.Has it been fucked with
or loosened or any wires...<i>- See any wires or anything?
- Excuse me, ma'am.</i>- No, it's clean.
- Huh?Then it's gonna be under the bus.
Probably it was rigged to one of the axles.I can't get under the bus right now,
Harry. It's kind of in motion.<i>Excuse me. Excuse me!</i>Hold on.There's an access panel
in the floor.<i>Underneath you, man. </i>All right, Harry, we're in.
Passenger relay. Sir!Take this. I want you
to tell him what I see.Okay! We got a wad!
Pretty big!There's a pretty big wad.<i>- Brass fittings!
- Brass fittings. </i>- I think I can reach the circuit wire.
- He can reach the circuit wire.No! No, no! D-Don't!
Don't do that!- That's a decoy. Classic.
- That's a classic decoy.- What else?
- What else?<i>- Hold on.
- Hold on. </i>Fuck me!Oh, darn.Harry, there's enough C-4 on this
thing to put a hole in the world.Okay. All right.
Just stay calm.- What else?
- Three triggers.- One on the axle I can't really see, a cellular remote...
- Officer.And a timer running
off a wristwatch.- A watch? What kind of watch?
- Gold.Gold band, fairly cheesy.Officer. Officer!What's on your mind, Harry?Shit, what do I do?
Officer!- What do I do? What do I... Which way?
- Aw, shit!- Get on the shoulder.
- Okay.Watch it, watch it!Um, stay on or get off?<i>- Stay on or get off?
- Off! Off! Hold on!</i>Oh, God.<i>- Keep going.
- It's red!</i>- Go! Go!
- Wh-What? Ow! My foot!This is much better.The bus is on Western,heading in a southbound
direction.<i>Now, when the bus did exit here,
it had a couple of close calls... </i><i>with a few cars
on the Century Freeway. </i><i>Yeah, yeah!
All right! Oh. </i><i>We don't know what authorities
are planning to do, but we can... </i><i>- I don't get it. </i>The watch is a shitty timer.
Why use it? What's he sayin'?- Lots of people have watches, Harry.
- This guy has no M.O.A bomber falls in love with one kind
of bomb, and they're very monogamous.This guy uses C-4, dynamite,
different trigger every time,and now he throws in
this watch.He's an encyclopedia of bombs.
He knows every kind.Yeah, and everything we do
to dismantle it.Wait a minute.I want to look at the files
for the last ten years.We did the mug shots already.
That's not gonna help.- No. I wanna look at cops.
- Come on. Let's go.Yeah. Mac, where have you been?I had to bail on the freeway.
We're in the city.I can see you.
Just keep going straight.<i>I'm gonna try
to clear the roads for you. </i>Just stay on line.<i>Shit! Oh, Jesus!
God! No!</i><i>- Go left!</i><i>- Sorry.
- Oh, my God!</i>Oh, geez!People, stay out of my way!
Stay out of my way!- Ma'am, up to the right.
- Okay, okay, okay. I see it, I see it, I see it!- Mac. Mac, you gotta get me out of here!
- Oh, God!A few more blocks, you're gonna
come up to a soft turn, right.<i>Then hold straight. I've got
some units waiting for you there. </i><i>They're gonna lead you
to the 105 Freeway. It's not in use. </i>It'll be empty.
You'll be totally clear.<i>Got it. </i><i>In a few blocks, we take
a soft turn to the right. </i>- I'll find you.
- Okay.Okay. Wait a minute.
Escort to where?<i>- Where do we get an escort to?
- Watch out!</i><i>- Where? Where?</i>Oh, God!<i>Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!</i>Oh, Jesus! Oh, no!<i>My God! My God!
I just hit the baby!</i>- Cans! Cans!
- I just hit the baby! Oh, my God!- There was no baby. It was full of cans.
- Are you sure?- Yes. Yes.
- Oh, my God!Okay, let's go.Oh, Jesus!
No! No! Don't!<i>- Get back!</i>Why aren't they in school?
Why aren't you in school?- Mac, we're boned.
- I'll get you out, Jack.All right, listen. We got
an entrance coming up, Jack.It's gonna be
a real ugly turn, though.<i>- How ugly?
- What's ugly?</i>Okay, we got a hard right comin' up
at the construction site.<i>This should be it. </i><i>- That is a dead end.
- There's a turn. </i>- I can't make that turn. No.
- You can make it. Keep left. You can make it wide.Oh, God, we're gonna tip over.
We're gonna tip over.You're right. We're gonna tip over.
Everyone on this side of the bus now!On this side of the bus, as far as you can, please!Hold on!Hold on!Over here, over here!
As far as you can, now!Mac, you'd better
clear this site out.<i>- Everybody hold on!
- This side of the bus!</i>Hold on!Hold on! Oh, God!
Here we go! Here we go!<i>Here we go!</i>Whoo! Oh, my God! Oh, God!
Is everybody all right?Yes!Take me to that interchange
at the 105!Oh, my God! We might have died.
I can't think.It's okay. If you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.Hold it right there!- Mac, I got 'em patched through!
- Right.Get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.- Okay.
- Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.No obstructions in the freeway. We have a
window here. I wanna make sure it stays open.- Right.
- You, sir. This gentleman's gonna drive you...<i>Thank goodness for this freeway. </i>Shoot.Could you do me a favor and hold
the wheel for me for a second?Hold the wheel?
Thank you.Ma'am, you did very well.Actually, you were incredible.
I've never seen driving like that.- Annie.
- What?It's my name. Annie.- Annie.
- As opposed to "ma'am. "Okay.So, why is all this
happening?I mean, what did we do,
bomb the guy's country or something?No, it's just a guy
who wants money.I don't buy that. It's not
a very good way to make money.So, um, what
is this guy's deal?A while back
he held some people for ransom.It went sour, and now
he's a little pissed at me.What does that
have to do with us?Nothing. It's a game.
If he gets the money, he wins.If the bus blows up,
he wins.- What if you win?
- Then tomorrow we'll play another one.But I'm not available
to drive tomorrow. Busy.<i>We got no match for that description. </i>No one's lost a thumb for
at least the last ten years.- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.Forget the files. I want you to
start going through the pension fund.This guy's drawin' disability. He may
not be L.A.P.D., but he's livin' here now.I want pictures!
I've seen this asshole.- Hey!
- Hey, Mac!Let's get these passengers
off the bus!- We can't do it, sir.
- There's no time for any stunts, Traven.- We gotta get these people out of harm's way.
- I got orders!We move these people,
he'll see.Remember...
crazy, not stupid.All right, look. Harry's tryin'
to find out who this guy is.- We think maybe he's a cop.
- Lieutenant!It's him.
He wants to talk to Jack.- He's on the line for you.
- Okay, give him the number.Give him the number!- How's he doing?
- The bleeding is less, but...- Are they going to help us?
- Sure they are. They're the police.Hey, your taxes are payin' their salary.
If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.I mean, you know...- Yeah.
- I think we have trust.But it looks on TV like you're tryin'
to get those passengers off the bus.Look, you gotta
let me have one.- Now, we went over the rules.
- As an act of faith.We have an injured man here.
The driver's been shot.Jack, now tell me that you haven't
been shooting the passengers.I thought it was customary
for a police officer...to, you know,
shoot the bad guys, huh?- This man has no time.
- No one gets off!It'll grease the wheels with the
money men if you show a little charity.There's still gonna be
plenty of us to kill.Okay, son, you can try
and unload the driver.You tell that wildcat behind
the wheel not to slow down, though,or he won't even get a chance
to bleed to death.And Jack? Don't slip.- He's letting us unload the driver.
- Norwood, get us closer!<i>- We're gonna get the bus driver off the bus!
- We're gonna get the driver off.</i>- Just him?
- For now. Gigantor!- Ortiz.
- Ortiz. I'm gonna need your help.<i>- Okay.
- Okay, I need you to pass him to me.</i>You have to keep him straight,
or I think the wound will tear.- What about the rest of us? What about the rest of us?
- Hey, hey! Lady!- Come on, Sam. I got you.
- I can't stay! I can't...- How you feelin'?
- Like I've been shot.<i>- Take care, Sam.
- Okay, Annie.</i><i>- Drive straight!
- Keep it straight!</i>- Okay, Annie, get as close as you can, okay?
- All right.Closer!
A little closer, Annie!- Annie, a little closer!
- Okay.<i>- Okay, how's this?</i>- Sorry! Sorry.
- Okay, Annie, no problem. Let's try it one more time.<i>A little more! Okay! Okay!
Right there! Steady!</i>Hold it steady!You got him? You got him?- Hold him!
- I got him! We're clear!- All right! Oh.
- I'm all right. Thanks.Oh, my God.Yes! Oh!It's gonna be okay.Come on! Come on, lady,
give me your hand!<i>- I have to, Annie.
- No, Helen! No, Helen, no!</i>- Come on! Right there! Over there!
- Helen, no! No!Here at the 105 Freeway
where the police have successfully led...<i>- the runaway bus... </i>No, Helen!Goddamn it, Mac! We gotta get
those fuckin' choppers out of here!...was driving the bus.
Well, I couldn't tell how old...An explosion.
Some kind of an explosion.<i>The bus hasn't exploded, but...
Oh, my God. </i>A woman caught
in the blast fell.She was pulled under the wheels.
This is terrible.Interactive TV, Jack. Wave
of the future! Huh?I can't be here.I can't, you know.<i>This is the wrong bus. </i>I mean, for me to...I can't die here.Hey, shut up, man.- I got a wife.
- Oh, you do?Hey! So if you
have a wife...<i>and I don't, does that
mean I'm expendable?</i>Hey, what are you
talkin' about, man?The guy's just talkin' crazy.
It gets on my nerves.<i>- Gets on everybody's nerves.
- Oh, yeah?</i>- I think I have the right to be a little bit upset...
- What are you staring at anyway?<i>After all that we've... </i><i>Why don't you just let everybody
die in peace, if that's what's gonna happen, huh?</i><i>So you're a tough guy, huh?
I got a right to be upset. </i><i>You're really tough, huh, Gigantor?
Why don't we just step outside?</i>Hey!- How are you doing? You all right?
- Mm-mm.What can I do?When that bomb went off...I know.I thought that was it. I thought
that was the bomb and I was dead.And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...- You were glad you were still alive.
- Mm-hmm.- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.You should be glad.
We all are.- It doesn't mean you don't care.
- I know, but she was so scared.<i>She was scared. She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed.</i>But, Annie, if she'd gotten off,
it would've killed us all.He's the asshole, Annie, the guy who
put us here. Remember that, okay?Big asshole.Okay.Are you sure?Well, how far?Sir, uh, we have
a serious problem.- What?
- This freeway isn't finished.- What are you talking about?
- The aerial unit caught it about three miles ahead.There's a section missing.Section missing?But it's on the map.
It's finished on the goddamn map!I guess they fell behind.Fuck. You're fired!
Everybody's fuckin' fired!Get me closer!Hey, get closer.
Watch him in the mirror.Jack!- How big is the section?
- Fifty feet. At least.There's a gap in the road
up ahead. It's big.You're kidding.
How big?<i>- Fifty feet. Jack.
- What?</i>We gotta get these people
off the bus somehow.You know I can't.<i>What did...
What did he say? Jack?</i>Jack, what'd he say?<i>What's the matter?</i>- There's a gap in the freeway.
- What?- What do you mean?
- How big is a gap?Fifty feet.
A couple of miles ahead.- This is crazy.
- Right along up there?- What is this?
- Geez.<i>Jack! Jack!</i><i>What if I shift into neutral
and just keep the engine revving?</i><i>- No, he'd have thought of that.
- Then what then? What? What?</i>- What? Jack!
- Floor it.<i>- What?
- Floor it!</i><i>- It's an interchange.
Might be an incline. Floor it! - Fine.</i>Everybody, hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.When we hit the gap,
heads down.That's it? That's it?That's all we can do. Let's put these
underneath your seat, all right?Put your bags
underneath the seat.Hey, I didn't mean
to shoot the guy.Hold on.Is this really gonna work?<i>Jack!</i>- Yeah.
- Jack.<i>- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, God. </i><i>- Come on, come on. Come on!
- God. </i>Oh, God.Oh, shit.Everybody, hold on!I wanna see our baby.Oh, God. Jack.Shit!<i>Okay. Okay. </i>Yes!<i>- We are way out of control!
- We made it!</i>- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay.All right! All right!
Let's go!- Is everybody okay?
- Yes! Yes!- We made it!
- We made it.<i>You are the man.
You are the man!</i><i>- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Goddamn! Yes!</i>- Oh, shit.
- I think you missed your calling.Yeah? What was it?Watch the road.
You should've been a pilot.Ow.- Jesus.
- Get off!- What?
- Get off this.Now, now! Get off this!In there.- Where, right here? Right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.Hey. Hey, hey,
stop! Stop!- He's just entered the airport.
- All right!- There's thousands of people there.
- That's my boy, Jack.He should be able to circle
the runways and buy us some time.<i>The choppers can't fly in there.
It's restricted airspace. </i>He's headed for
the end of the field.That must be Bravo Tango,
an emergency runway.Yeah, let's hope it's built.
Let's move!We're at the airport.Yeah. So?I already seen
the airport.Yeah?Very, very exciting, Jack.Some close calls, huh?- But you've done all right for yourself.
- What do you want?I want money, Jack.I wish, uh, that I had
some loftier purpose,but, um, I'm afraid in the end
it's just the money, Jack.I would like, uh,large, uh,
nonsequential bills...in two clear plastic
bags, unmarked.- Can you remember all that?
- What are you telling me for?Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk
to you like they're your best friend,and they don't even know ya.Why are they messing
with me, huh?Do they think I'm
doin' this for fun?- Aren't you?
- Oh, that's unfair, Jack.You don't know how I feel about this.
You don't even know me.I know you want a shitload
of money you didn't earn.Oh, I earned it.I spent my life earning it.<i>I got a medal, too, Jack. A medal and a
pink slip and a "sorry about your hand. "</i>- You have to let me off.
- Oh, no! That's not good.You want me to help you? I need
to talk to these people face-to-face.They think you're bullshit.They don't think that.Look, you want the money, I don't want
anyone else to die. Let me get on the ground.Just me.
That's not against the rules.- All right. I want you back real fast.
- Fine.Jack, nothing tricky now.
You know that I'm on top of you.Do not attempt
to grow a brain.It could encourage other terrorists...So I guess
there's a plan now?Could be.- Yeah?
- He's letting me off.<i>- What?
- Just keep circling. You'll be fine. </i>Everybody, sit tight.
I'm getting off for a minute.- Do you think that's a good idea?
- It'll be okay.- What, are you just gonna leave us here?
- I would.Don't worry.
I won't go far.<i>Hey. Don't forget
about us. </i>- The choppers are gone, Jack. Let's dump the passengers now.
- No way. He's ready for that.- How is that possible?
- I don't know how, Mac. I just know he is.He's been a step ahead every time. If we
unload, he'll take them out, I guarantee.- So where does that put us?
- I have to try and dismantle that bomb.That's an incredible ride...
the 10 Freeway...leaving Los Angeles
to the 105 Freeway,this Santa Monica bus has ended up here
at Los Angeles International Airport...<i>circling the runway. </i>I'm tellin' ya, honey,
he's somewhere jerkin' off.<i>He didn't have to get on the bus
in the first place, Ortiz.</i>Hey, get your ass
behind the yellow line.What is that?<i>I have no idea. </i>We won't be able to hold
this thing steady for very long.I just need a few minutes. If I can't
do it by then, I can't do it at all.- Harry, you with me?
- Yeah. You be careful, Jack.<i>What is he doing?
Oh, my God, he is insane.</i><i>Okay, Jack, this is it.
Don't get dead. </i>- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.Oh, Christ.Just keep it steady.Oh, thank you for
the tip, Ortiz.<i>- This guy is nuts!
- Gosh darn.</i>We're gonna have to try to bypass
the remote current with the battery.Can you find the trip
wire for the remote?I don't know.
I got a few choices here.- Black and red?
- And green.Okay. All right. I'm gonna guess he's not
gonna go with standard copper for the remote.That'd be too weak.
I'd use a fiber alloy.Jack, I'm gonna need
you to look at the wire.- Harry, it's covered.
- Yeah, I know.You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.Right.Fuck me!Shit!- Bull's-eye! - Great. Okay, I
want you to clip on the battery...- and then run it to the lead wire.
- Copy.I can't bypass. It'll fire.Oh, shit!
It's a collapsible circuit.<i>"Howard Payne, Atlanta P.D. Bomb squad. </i>"Retired in Sun Valley
in 1989...when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine. "That's our scumbag!
We got him, Jack. We found him.- We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.
- Great.Get out of there and sit tight.
We're gonna go after the source.- Watch your back.
- Wait, wait, wait for me!Mac, get me out of here.Somebody go to the back and check
and see if he came out the back! Go!<i>- Can you see him?
- He's not behind us!</i>- What?
- He's not back here!Oh, my God! Go look! Lay down and look
under the bus and see if you can see him.<i>- Can you see him?
- No!</i><i>You don't see him, like,
back by the tires?</i><i>- I can't see him!
- Are you sure?</i>I can't see him!- Oh, I hit him!
- What the hell was that?- Oh, my God! Do you see him?
- Did we hit him?<i>Look out the side of the window
and see the other side!</i>- My tools!
- Will somebody get him his tools?<i>Please help him! Hurry!</i>Oh, God. We're dragging him.
Do you see him?Where is he? Is he there?<i>- Do you see him?
- Jack!</i>- I see him!
- What?<i>- I see him!
- You do? Is he okay?</i>- He's all right!
- Yeah! Whoo!Hold my legs! Hold my legs!
Somebody, hold my legs!Hold his legs!
Hold his legs!Come on!Come on! I got ya!- Is he hurt? Is he okay?
- Pull! Pull!Come on! Come on!We got him now!
Come on, pull!Jesus, I can't believe it.- You are a complete jerk! You know that?
- Oh, thank God!- Did ya have any luck with the bomb?
- Yeah. It didn't go off.<i>- Ortiz, thanks.
- How many lives you got, man?</i><i>You're not too bright, man,</i><i>but you got some big,
round, hairy cojones. </i>That's... very gross, Ortiz.Can't even pay him
a compliment.- How you doin'?
- You scared the shit out of me, Jack! Ow.Other than that,
I'm fine.What is that smell?- It's gas.
- We're leaking gas?We are now.What, you thought you needed
another challenge or something?- Mac.
- Mac here. Go ahead.Can you get a fuel truck
to pace us here? We're losing gas.- I'll see what I can find. How much time?
- I don't know. Ten minutes.- It doesn't look good.
- Got ya.<i>- Norwood, get a fuel car out here on the double.
- Right. </i>Is that gonna work?I don't know.Come on, Harry.
Save my life.Harry, tell me good news, man.Oh, I'm sorry, Jack.
He didn't make it.You fuck!It was the watch that
led him to me, wasn't it?Huh? It seemed a little hammy
to me to build the bomb...out of my precious
retirement gift.But, you know, I figured
a sign that said Howard Payne...would be pushing it.I'm gonna rip your fuckin'
spine out, I swear to God.You're gonna do exactly
as you're told.Jack, we both know that he was
the brains of your particular operation.You can't beat me.
You're gonna pay me every dollar.Otherwise, you, the wildcat and
every innocent person on that bus...are gonna end up
just like your friend.Are you paying attention?
Jack, are you listening to me?- Jack? Jack!
- Yeah.Good. Now, you tell them...that the drop point
is Pershing Square.<i>There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner. </i><i>You drop the bags and leave. </i>I don't show until all
your people are gone.It's gettin' on
to 11:00 a. m., Jack,and I think it's gonna
be a very pretty day.- Jack!
- Damn it!Jack. Come on, Jack.<i>Don't give up on me, Jack.
Come on, please. Jack, stop it!</i>Jack, come on! Stop it, okay? Don't
give up on me right now, all right?<i>Hey, we're really scared,
and we need you right now. </i>I can't do this by myself.
Please? Jack, please.Okay? Please.
All right?- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not. We got this far, okay?I'll be damned.<i>You go to the University
of Arizona?</i>- Yeah. So?
- Good football team.Yeah, I guess so.
I don't really know.Arizona Wildcats.- Right.
- He can see you.- What?
- He can see you.- He can see me...
- Just keep looking straight ahead.He called you a wildcat before.
I didn't even pick up on it.The bastard's got a camera right
in your face. He can see the whole bus.He's been playing me
from minute one.He can see me,
but can he hear me?It doesn't look like it.
He's just watching you.<i>This is a special news bulletin.

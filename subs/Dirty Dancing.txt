<i>You never forget your first love.</i><i>You carry it with you always.</i><i>The right song instantly
takes you back to that time.</i><i>For me, it was the summer of '63.</i><i>Jackie Kennedy was still queen of Camelot</i><i>and I was still known to my family as "Baby."</i><i>The Feminine Mystique.</i> What does that mean?It's about how women's magazines
portray housewives as happyand career girls as unhappy,
when it's usually the opposite.I have to throw out my magazines?<i>My older sister Lisa,</i><i>a college girl majoring in finding a husband.</i>"Bedroom Blues After the 10th Year
of Marriage," is that their agenda?All those articles are about sex
and beauty and fashion,- as if that's all women care about.
- Girls, please,your father hasn't taken a vacation in years.And look what you did...
you brought the bad weather.So can we please just stop fighting
so we can get some sunshine?<i># Oh, I said #</i><i># They don't cry #</i><i>My mom, the quintessential happy housewife.</i><i># Cry-yi-yi #</i><i># My, oh, my #</i><i>My dad, my hero and my role model.</i><i>I wanted to be just like him.</i><i># I wonder why #</i>- <i># Silly boy #</i>

our summer at Kellerman's.</i><i>The summer I stopped being the baby for good.</i><i># Big girls don't cry #</i>For seniors, we have water polo
in the middle pool.And for kiddies,popsicles... orange, lemon, lime...all in the main lodge.And at 1:30, boats are on the lake.
Learn to row, work those arms.And at 5:00, dinner is served.
We have meatloaf.Jake! The prodigal son has returned.- Max.
- What's it been... five years?Ten. Jake has been so busy with work.Well, even a world-famous heart surgeon
deserves a rest.- No doubt.
- You're prettier than ever.Oh, Max!And is this the baby?She's practically a woman.Baby's going to Mount Holyoke
in the fall. She's the smart one.My grandson Neil is at the Cornell School
of Hotel Management.Maybe we should get you two kids together.- Billy!
- Yes, sir.Get Dr. Houseman's bags.- Remember Lisa?
- Yes, of course.What, are you smuggling gold bricks in here?- Uh, books mostly. I read a lot.
- You're one of those smart girls.Smart? She's gonna cure cancer.- Who knows how to merengue?
- Come on.- One, two, three, four, and shimmy.
- Seven, eight.It's a two-four rhythm, folks.Two, one, two, three, four.One, two, three, four.One, two, three, four.- One, two, three, four.
- Yeah.Marco. Help me demonstrate.One, two, three, four.One, two, and shimmy.Looks like you've got an admirer.- Who?
- The piano player.Get real, Baby.Why not? He's cute.So are puppies, but I'm not gonna date one.Seven, eight, shimmy around the world.Let me see those coconuts....three, one, don't forget to smile!All right, everybody, now grab a partner.- Dad?
- No.Dad, come on. It'll make Mom happy. Come on.You know, the first time we danced,
you were dancing on my feet.I just can't believe
you're going off to college.Dad, I'll only be a few hours away.You can visit me anytime.I'm sorry, Dad. Sorry.See? You're still dancing on my feet.- You a college man?
- Yes, sir.I just graduated from Georgetown.I'm starting Harvard Medical
School in the fall.Harvard? Never heard of it.My husband was a waiter here the summer
before he started medical school.That's how we met.You're a very lucky man, Dr. Houseman,
to have such a beautiful family.I hope to be that lucky.Robbie, the Housemans
are very dear friends of mine.Whatever they need, you make it happen.Yes, sir.I wanted Baby to meet my grandson, Neil.I hear you're going to Mount Holyoke.Single-sex education
is superior in my opinion.- Hmm.
- Baby's reading a book you might like...<i>The Feminine Mystique?</i>I read it, cover to cover.Betty Friedan is a revolutionary thinker.
I'd love to hear your thoughts.You know we have ballroom dancing
after dinner. Care to join me?Sure, Neil, that sounds great.I do a pretty mean foxtrot.See you out there, Doc.So, Baby, you gonna be a doctor?Hopefully a surgeon, like my dad.That's fantastic. A woman can be
anything she wants to be.- I truly believe that.
- Thanks, Neil.Good evening, one and all.I want to thank our band leader
of 20 years, Tito Suarez.Tito.Tito, my friend, can you believethere's only three weeks left
of our summer season?Oh, no, Mr. Kellerman.We've been having way too much fun
for it to be all over.Tell them about our summer-ending
talent show.Well, whoever you are, whatever gift
you have in life, come.Share it with us.And speaking of talent,please welcome our very own dance team...Penny and Johnny!- They're really good.
- I guess they're okay,but Johnny's got a real attitude problem.The guests love him.I mean, <i>I</i> can dance like that.Whoo!- Hey, Baby.
- Oh. Yeah?I've been practicing my dancing.I could use a few pointers.Tonight, in my room?I'll be there.Maybe... we should sneak back to the room
while the girls are occupied.Hey, uh, I'm kind of tired.I think I'm just gonna go back and read.What about Neil?We're madly in love.
We're going to elope tomorrow.You know you can't spend the whole
summer with your nose in books, sweetie.Why not?Mm-hmm.Hey, Baby, wait up.
I'll walk you to your cabin.You sometimes see garter snakes around here.I like snakes.What about bears? We had one last summer.Good night, Neil.Thank you for the dance. See you tomorrow.Good night.Hey, Billy, right?Hey, smart girl! You lost?No, I'm just taking a walk.What's up there?This territory's for staff only.- Whoa.

'cause you're not a baby anymore.What's wrong with you?Nothing. Just not hungry.Well, you need to eat.- Tonight's our longest shift.
- Thanks, Dad.Hey, Penny!I heard you give private lessons. How much?Forget it, college boy. You can't afford it.Really? I hear she doesn't charge much.- What'd you say?
- He just wants to rile you up.- Don't let him.
- You're a real tough guy, Johnny.- So why am I not impressed?
- Hey!Mr. Kellerman.- Is there a problem here?
- No, sir.No problem on my end.Grandfather, I told you. He has
a real attitude problem.Mr. Castle, if I want Marlon Brando,
I'll call Hollywood.How long have you worked here?Six years, sir.So it's not possible that you don't know
where the staff entrance is.Yeah, I know where it is.He had another private lesson
with Mrs. Pressman.Shut your mouth.This is a family destination.If I hear about you giving the guests
anything but dance lessons,you're out on your <i>keister.</i>Really? Is that the company policy?'Cause I get the feeling the rules are
different for some of us.That's right. This isn't the United Nations.Those boys are all Ivy Leaguers.Any father here would be thrilled
to see his daughter with any of them.Yeah, they seem like real sweethearts.I have dozens of résumés for other dancers,some of whom dance on Broadway.If you can't get along with my staff,say the word and I'll call them tomorrow.We won't be any trouble, Mr. Kellerman.Right, Johnny?Right.Good job, sir.Johnny, just ignore him.I signed us up for a putting
competition tomorrow. You game?Sure.What else am I gonna do all day?You're such a perfectionist.I wonder who I got that from.You wanna be a doctor, don't you?
You're not doing it for me, right?I mean, of course, it's not pure
coincidence that I chose medicine.As long as you chose,'cause I don't remember ever
making a choice to be a doctor.My father made it clear it was expected
from the time I was six years old.I'd just hate for you to feel that way.- A special going on today.
- Thank you.Try one on.- Me?
- Yeah.- No, I'm not really into wigs.
- You'd make a great Marilyn.Come on. It's fun to be someone else.Okay.Mm.- You're a wonderful dancer.
- Thank you.It must be incredible
to do something so well.Your parents must be really proud of you.I don't know. We haven't spoken
in a few years, so...What's your name?- Frances.
- Thank you.But everyone calls me Baby.Does that bother you?No. Not really.My sister couldn't say Frances
for the longest time,so she called me Baby. Kind of just stuck.Well, you don't look like a baby to me.It's only $16.99.
I can charge it to your account.- Hey, Penny.
- Yeah.Hey, kid.I just booked a private. Can you
cover my 2:00 p.m. mambo class?Sure, Johnny. Never a dull moment.Hey, Baby, you should buy that wig.What do you think of Argentina?Well, the government's a mess
since the last election.The guerrillas won't let the Peronistas
take their seats.- Why?
- Well, I was just thinkingthat we'd always talked about traveling
once the girls were out of the house.To Argentina?Okay, so forget Argentina.What about Paris?Remember our honeymoon?Walking down the Champs-Élysées,drinking <i>vin rose</i> at the bistro
next to the hotel.We can go to Paris if you want.I have to put a request in at the hospital.How about a year from next Christmas?We can bring the girls.That sounds wonderful.- Let me go.
- What's wrong?You're late.Are you ready? Let's go.Are you okay?Sorry, I was worried about you.Yeah. I'm fine.You're sick. Let me walk you home.No, no, I have to work.You can't work. You're sick.I'm not sick. I'm pregnant.Forget you ever heard that.Ladies and gentlemen,Miss Rhode Island, Vivian Pressman!<i># Never know how much I love you #</i><i># Never know how much I care #</i><i># When you put your arms around me #</i><i># I get a fever that's so hard to bear #</i><i># You give me fever #</i><i># When you kiss me,

- Doesn't matter.Yeah, it matters. Whoever he is
needs to step up.Well, he won't. I already asked him.We'll figure it out.We need money... money we don't have.My cousin went.Guy charged her 250 bucks.Could you ask Mr. Kellerman for an advance?For this? Yeah, sure.He's just aching for a reason to fire us.Johnny, I'm scared.What if it starts to show?- I'll help you.
- This is none of your business.She's just trying to help.And thanks for coming to get me.
You did your good deed for the day.Now why don't you waltz on back
to the ballroom?Where are you going?Uh, nowhere. Go to sleep.Please tell me it's not to see our waiter.Come on, Baby, you're 18. Time to grow up.I just think there's more
to life than getting married.Why can't I just get married
without you judging me?Let's just accept the fact
that we have nothing in common.If we weren't sisters, we'd never be friends.Oh, thank you.You're so nice.A toast to the most beautiful girl
at Kellerman's.- Robbie.
- It's true.You're exactly the kind of girl
I dream about marrying someday.When is someday?I don't know. You tell me.What does that mean?Let me take this.I think...that you are incredible.You do?I do.How do you like hearing those words?- "I do"?
- Mm.Hmm. I do.I do. I do.- Robbie, wait.
- Why?Wait.- But we love each other.
- Robbie, stop.- Shh.
- No, stop. I'm...Wait, I... stop it.Robbie, stop it!- No, Robbie!
- Oh!I said no, you jerk!What are you gonna do? Cry to daddy?- Come on, Lisa. Come back.
- Don't you dare follow me!I'm gonna go to Mr. Kellerman and tell him!Tell him what?You came after me, remember?You brought the wine.Don't ever speak to me again.- Robbie, you play golf?
- Yes, sir.My father always said he made more deals
on the golf course than in the boardroom.You should come play golf with me.I'm sure Robbie has lots
of responsibilities in the kitchen.She's right, Dr. Houseman.I have to, uh, inventory the pantry today.Lisa, you don't have to be so rude.He's not gonna be a waiter forever, you know.Why do you people thinkthat just because
a guy goes to Harvard or Yalethat means he's perfect?I mean, maybe he's an axe murderer.Are you saying our waiter's an axe murderer?No. I... don't know, but he could be.We would never know.She's right, Jake. We would never know.What?What's the deal? You've been letting me win?No. Not at all.What's bugging you, honey?Can I borrow some money from you?It's for a friend... I can't tell you why.Is it something illegal?No.Well, how much do you need?$250.Wow.That's a lot of money.I'll pay you back, but it's for something
really important, Dad.I need you to trust me on this.I do trust you, Baby.Thanks, Daddy.<i># When I'm alone #</i><i># With no one to love me #</i><i># And the tears start to fall #</i><i># From my eyes #</i><i># Won't somebody #</i><i># Somebody please love me? #</i><i># Whoa #</i><i># Just a little, just a little #</i><i># Please love me #</i><i># Sometimes I get a little troubled #</i><i># Yeah, yeah #</i><i># And I don't know #</i><i># Which way to turn #</i><i># If I had somebody #</i><i># To love me just a little #</i><i># My heart, my heart #</i><i># Would no longer burn #</i><i># Oooh #</i><i># When I'm alone #</i><i># No one to love me #</i><i># Tears are falling from my eyes #</i>Hey, um, can I talk to you guys?In private.<i># Somebody #</i><i># Somebody please love me #</i><i># Whoa, just a little #</i><i># Just a little... #</i>I have money for you.$250.It's all there.- You're kidding?

You gotta start on the two.<i>Two,</i> three, four.
Find the <i>two,</i> you understand?- <i>Two,</i> three...
- No.Can you count?One, <i>two</i>, three, four. One, <i>two,</i> three, four.One, <i>two,</i> three, four. Find it.
Listen. Watch me.Six, seven, eight. One, <i>two,</i> three, four.<i>Two,</i> three, four.<i>Two,</i> three, four. <i>Two</i>, three, four.To a dance position.Basic position.

Two, three, four.Two, three... Head up.Relax. Breathe.Frame. Look, spaghetti arms.This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.I don't go into yours,
you don't go into mine.You gotta hold the frame.Again.Two, three, four.
Let your whole body feel it.It's not just your feet.What was that?I'm ready. I was preparing.Two, three, four. Use your hips.Two, three, four. Don't touch your hips,
just use them.Two, three, four. Two, three, four.- Two, three, four.
- There we go.Two, three, four.Feel your partner. Two, three, four.It's gotta be off of them.There's nobody there.You have to imagine there's somebody there,just like you have to imagine
you have more rhythm.Two, three, four. Two, three, four.Two, three, four.Look at my eyes. Hey.Not like that.- They're so large, I just...
- That's funny.There we go.Better. Two...Two, three, four. Two, three, four.You look like my patients
at the V.A. hospital.What war have you been fighting?Oh, I just went for a really long hike.- By yourself?
- With Neil?No. By myself.We read Thoreau last year in English,
and it got me inspired.I signed us up for the tournament tomorrow.We have a 7:00 a.m. tee time.- You don't wanna do it?
- No, I do. I do.I just... I made plans.Neil is taking me out on a canoe.I'll do the tournament with you.I mean, I know I'm not as good
as Baby, but I'll do my best.- Greetings, Houseman family.
- Neil.I hear you stole my golf partner
to be your canoe date.Yes. I'm quite fond of canoeing,and we have new paddles in from Denmark.Would you like to see
those paddles now, Baby?Yes. I would. I would like to go see- those... paddles.
- Let's go see those paddles.So, um, are you taking
a canoe ride with someone else?What? No.No. Not at all.I'm taking dance lessons, and I just
don't want my family to know.Lisa's the one who likes dancing
and boys and lipstick.And I'm the other one...the one who likes books and artand dissecting fetal goats.Why can't you be both?You should be able to take
a merengue class or wear lipstickwithout it leading
to the end of Western civilization.Isn't that what <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>
is all about?That women shouldn't have to choose
between a career and a personal life?You're absolutely right, Neil.Good morning, ladies and gents
and children of all ages.If you think you're the next Henny Youngman,don't miss amateur comedy night
tonight in the polo lounge.You know, marriage is a three-ring process.You have the engagement ring,
the wedding ring,and then the suffering. See you tonight.Uh.What's going on? Did you find a doctor?Yeah, he's the one my cousin saw in Jersey.Billy's gonna drive me,
but it'll have to be on my day off.What's wrong with that?We just got a gig dancing
at the Sheldrake on Thursdays.- Oh, we can't afford to lose it.
- There must be someone to fill in.I asked everybody.Maria's working, so is Barb and Siobhan.Kellerman Jr. added belly dancing
to the schedule.- I know he's your boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.There's gotta be somebody.What about her?Her?You gotta be kidding.Yeah, of course she's kidding.It's a mambo, exactly what Johnny's
been teaching you.And I'll help you learn the routine.You're a good teacher, Johnny.You can train anyone.Even her.I'm in if you're in.All right. With me, from the top.
Follow my lead.One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.One, two, three.Cross-body lead.Good.One, two, three. Five, six, seven.One, two, three.Here.Good. We got it.Now it's time to learn the lift.What lift?What are we doing here?
I thought we were doing the lift.We are. Gotta work on your balance.If you can dance here,
you can dance anywhere. Come on.I'm not stupid, you know?
Reverse psychology won't work on me.That's cool. Let's go home.The log is your friend.Okay?You ready?You good?Yeah.Whoo!All right, lifts are all about trust.I gotta trust you, too,
or else we could both get really hurt.Trust, trust, trust. Okay.Don't think. Trust.Okay.But what... what if I fall?- Can you swim?
- Yes, I can swim.There you go. You'll be fine.Does it matter which foot I start with?Whichever one is here,'cause the next one, you know...is gonna be in the water.Okay.Okay.Come on!- You ready?
- I'm ready.Okay, here we go.That's it! That's it!Oh!We're getting there.
You got another one like that?Up, lift!Two, three...Good, good, hold it!Come here, I got you.You're a good teacher.Yeah. Obviously.All right, come on. Let's go.Come on, you gonna lift <i>me</i> now?- No way.
- Come on...- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.Come on.What are you doing?The girls are out.I locked the door.It's broad daylight, Marjorie.Well, we are married.
I don't think anyone will mind.I just spent four hours golfingwith that orthodontist
from Newton, Leon Feinberg.He talked nonstop to throw me
off my game, and it worked.You haven't touched me in almost a year.Can we please not have
this conversation right now?Why do I think I pushed you
to come back here?I has hoping that maybe
this place would remind you.The last time that we were here,
you couldn't keep your hands off me.Well, that was 10 years ago.I'm 45 years old, Jake. I'm not dead yet.I...Marge.- You mind?
- Please.That looks good.You should have one.You look really fantastic, by the way.Your husband must feel like
he won the lottery.He doesn't need to win the lottery.He's rich, filthy rich.Had nothing when we met.I actually married for love.So did I. My husband was a waiter here.No kidding.We'd love to invite you both
for a glass of wine tonight.Well, it's just me.We're divorced.Oh, I'm so sorry.Oh, don't be. I'm having a ball.I'm doing all the things he hated.I used to be a really good salsa dancer,but then I gave it up for Lent,
or marriage...kind of the same thing, don't you think?There's an upside to divorce, you know.You're free.Are you going?Yeah.Well, wait just a second.I... I have something for you.Thank you, Vivian, but really,
I can't take this.Oh, of course you can.It was my husband's. I don't need it anymore.It's valuable. You can sell it.Stay.Just... please stay, just... I...I can't stand to sleep alone.I just lie awake in the bed
and listen to the walls creak.I can't stay.Disappointed?No. Not at all.Johnny had a private lesson, so he sent me.He says you keep trying to lead.What?Mm, you have to let the man lead.Give me a frame, please. Thank you.One, two, three, four.One, two, three, four.One, two, three, four.One, two, three... you're leading.- I'm trying not to.
- Okay.When I put pressure here,
you go in that direction.Like a dog being pulled on a leash?No, not like a dog.Like a woman dancing with a man.There's power in letting go.I think you're brainwashed.I think you're too much in your head, Baby,'cause dancing comes from down here.You get to tease him, make him work for it.- Mm-hmm.

and forget everything I learned?- You won't.
- How do you know?Because you've done all the hard work,
and because Johnny's a pro.And as long as you let him lead,
you'll never lose your way.Let him lead, shoulders down,
lock my frame...Don't forget to breathe.And have fun with it. You're gonna be great.Hey, I, um...I wanna thank you for what you did for me.And I want you to know...I don't sleep around.I thought he loved me.Hey.You're gonna be fine tonight.So are you.Come on, let's go, ladies!What do you think?<i># Just a little piece of me. #</i>That was beautiful.Thank you. Do you play?Me? Oh, no, I'm not musical at all.I don't believe that for a second. Come on.I... I don't think so. I have small fingers.I have just the thing.Perfect for small fingers.Oh, just... here.Look at that. You'll be
better than me in no time.- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'm serious.Marco?It's almost show time. Shouldn't
you be getting dressed?Sure thing, boss.Hey, will you teach me more later?Um...The summer's almost over.But I'll try, okay?Mm-hmm.If you care to come back here next year,
you'll stick to the job we pay you for.We weren't doing anything.
She wants to learn the ukulele.I don't care what she wants,
and neither does her daddy.Leave the little white girls alone.The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to presenttonight's spotlight dance team...Castle and Johnson in "Mambo Magic"!Cross body-lead.Breathe.Angel lift. Come on.All right.It's okay.- I started on the two!
- You did.Every move I made,
you were right there with me.- Oh, I choked on the lift.
- Screw the lift.Did you see Mr. Louis out there? He loved us.You know, me and Penny, we collect
each paycheck like it's our last.Stretch it out, travel light.
It's a gypsy life.But this gig, this could
change things for us,give us a home base,
let us breathe, like she said.That's all thanks to you.Oh, no, you guys deserve the job.Yeah, but you helped us keep it.I give you a lot of credit, Baby.What you did in there,
in front of all those people?That takes guts.
Not a lot of people have that.It's almost midnight.
I gotta get Tito his car back.Come on, get up here. I'm not your chauffeur.Johnny! Johnny! Johnny, hurry!
It's Penny! She's in her cabin!Dad? Daddy?Daddy, I need your help.What's wrong?It's okay, breathe. Breathe, shh.Let him in. He's a doctor.What happened?If you want me to help her, I need to know.The guy said he was a real doctor.Did he wear any gloves?Okay.I can't help you unless I examine you,and I'm sure that's the last
thing you want right now.But this is very serious.
You should probably go to the hospital.No, no. No way.Let the doctor look at you, Penny.I assume you're responsible for this girl.Yes.You should be ashamed of yourself.All right, everybody out.I'm Dr. Houseman. I'm gonna take care of you.Why did you do that?- Does it matter?
- Yeah. It matters.It's not true.I don't care what he thinks of me,
as long as he takes care of Penny.That guy was a hack.- Probably used dirty equipment.
- Is she gonna be okay?Well, time will tell.I did what any emergency room
would have done.I put her on antibiotics, gave her
something to help her sleep.I'll check on her in the morning.Thank you so much for your help, doctor.- We really appreciate...
- She could have died tonight.And you, you weren't even there with her.What kind of man does that?Don't ever come near my daughter again.Are we clear?Yes, sir.We're leaving, Baby, now. Now!Was that where my money went...
the money you lied about?I was afraid to tell you the truth.I thought we had a close,
honest relationship.- Since when do you lie?
- I don't!And not that it matters to you,
but here's what I think of that guy.He's not good enough to wash my car.You're not to associate with him again.Yes, Daddy.You're not who I thought you were.- Not by half.
- I'm sorry.I bragged about you
to anyone who would listen.I thought you hung the moon.Please, Daddy, just let me explain.Did you know it was illegal,and that by helping her,
you could go to jail?Use your brain, Baby,that amazing brain I spent my entire life
filling with everything I know.- You're not a kid anymore.
- Then stop treating me like one.And stop calling me Baby.I'm 18 years old.You're right. My job is done.Good luck, Frances.Can I come in?You shouldn't be here.My dad shouldn't have
talked to you like that.- He's wrong about you.
- No, he's not.I should have been there with her.Instead, I was off hustling another gig,being a big shot.- Your dad's a smart guy.
- No.Not about this.You should have told him the truth.It wouldn't make any difference.He thinks I'm not good enough for you.And he's right.You're gonna go off to college,
make a difference in the world,and when you look back on your life,
you're gonna be proud.What am I gonna look back on?- Dancing.
- Dancing.The way you dance?It's beautiful and inspiring.Do you know why I dance?'Cause this is the only thing
I was ever good at.I wasn't like you, Baby.Every time I look at a book, the letters
start swimming around on the page.So I dropped out of school.Hung around my cousin's garage.He and his buddies
taught me how to hot wire carsand sell them off in parts.It was a great gig until I got caught.I served nine months in county jail.And when I got home...my father had changed the locks on the door.I was 15.Are you trying to scare me away?Yes.You aced the final exam,
just like you ace everything.Congratulations. Now please,
get out of my life.Will you do me one favor?Will you dance with me one more time?Come on, Baby.Please. Tonight happened so fast.I wanna remember it.And then, I swear I'll leave you
alone after that."How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice!"Start you next career today,and sign up for Kellerman's
end-of-the-season talent show.I saw that. It's okay. That's her point.May I have the milk, please?Thanks.Good morning, everybody.Hope you're all performing
in our talent show.I'm sorry to say we're, uh...
we can't. We're leaving early.We're gonna beat the weekend traffic.Oh. Well, maybe next year.What? We can't leave. I'm singing a duet.I learned to play the ukulele and everything.I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I have patients I need to see.I'll try to make it up to you.Do you wanna go
to the driving range this morning?I'll teach you how to golf.Me? Sure.Okay.Mom, can you change his mind about leaving?Probably not. I'm sorry, girls.He's not mad at you. He's mad at me.Why would he be mad at you?He's just in a mood.Well, you should be able to go
back to work in a couple days.Thank you, doctor.Penny, I'm not your father,
and this is really not my place.But any medical scare is a wake-up call.It's time to take stock of your life.I always tell this to my patients,so when you're my age,
and you're looking back on your lifeand the choices you made, good or bad...you don't have any regrets.Maybe you do, but they
don't take you by surprise.I'll check on you tomorrow.Oh, thanks, doc. You're the best.So that's me, huh?- Big regret?
- Leave it alone, Johnny.- What if he tells Kellerman?
- He won't.- How do you know?
- 'Cause I asked him not to.And I trust him.Hey.You just missed your father.He's such a great guy.Hey, all this commotion,
and I never heard how last night went.- Good.
- Fine.I didn't do the lift, but...Mr. Louis was crazy about us.Oh, that's great!I hope he likes me as much as he likes Baby.Come on, you're a star.I'm gonna go, but I'll see you guys later?Yeah.What are you doing?What?How many times have you told me
not to get mixed up with them?She's different.She's a peach. But that's not the point.Kellerman's all over us. Please.I messed up enough for the both of us
this summer.Promise me you'll end it.Johnny.I can't talk right now.
I got to cover class for Penny.- Okay. Can we talk later?
- I have to work.I'm not on vacation like you.
I actually work here.I missed you last night.Oh.Sorry. I had a gig.A better gig than me?I'll make it up to you tonight.I'll come by later.Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.
We're in for a very special treat tonight.One of my favorite guests...
Mrs. Marjorie Houseman.Hi, everyone.I met my husband here... in this room.The band was playing a beautiful song.I've been working on it for the talent show.But...it turns out we have to leave early.So I hope that you'll indulge me.<i># Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note #</i><i># Though by tomorrow, you're gone #</i><i># The song has ended #</i><i># But as the songwriter wrote #</i><i># The melody lingers on #</i><i># They may take you from me #</i><i># I'll miss your fond caress #</i><i># But though they take you from me #</i><i># I'll still possess #</i><i># The way you wear your hat #</i><i># The way you sip your tea #</i><i># The memory of all that #</i><i># Oh, no, they can't take away from me #</i><i># We may never, never meet again #</i><i># On the bumpy road to love #</i><i># Still I'll always, always #</i><i># Keep the memory of #</i><i># The way you hold your knife #</i><i># The way we danced till 3:00 #</i><i># The way you changed my life #</i><i># Oh, no, they can't take that away from me #</i><i># No, they can't take that away #</i><i># Away from me. #</i>Johnny, I know you're in there!You can't do this to me!You can't just act like you've never met me,like this thing never happened!You know, you may act like you're
this too-cool-for-school jackass,but you don't fool me!Because I know you......and I know that this thing
meant something...Marjorie, what... we can stay.It's only a few more days.Lisa's got her heart set on the talent show.Please, unpack.I don't need more drama.Wow.Well, what do you want me to say?That... that I love you,
I can't live without you?Well, of course you can live without me,
Jake. You've been at it for a while.You know, I used to play a game.From the time you got home from work,how long would it take for you
to say anything to me?You wanna hear your best time?Fourteen hours.You came home at 6:00.You said, "Toast, please" the next morning.Look, I deal with life and death all day.- Yeah.
- And when I lose a patient,it takes away a little bit of my soul.
I don't wanna burden you with that.Burden me, please! At least we'd be talking!We live like roommates.And now the girls are grown,
and well, you've got your job,and I don't know what to do with myself.So, take up needlepoint or gardening.I don't need a hobby, Jake. I need a husband.- I'm right here!
- No, you're not!I think we should consider
living apart for a while.I called a lawyer.You did what? You...What, you're asking for a divorce?Yes.That makes no sense.I've been faithful to you.I've provided for you and the girls.
I've given you everything you wanted.Not everything, Jake.So, you'd rather be alone...than be married to me?Yes. I'd rather be alone than lonely.Marco?- What's wrong?
- Have you seen my sister?No, not tonight.I need to find her. Will you help me?Please?Sure. I'll help you.Maybe she's back at the cabin.It's over.What is?My family is falling apart.I thought my parents would
be married forever, and...Uh, come on.
I'll walk you back to your cabin.Just because it's dark.And then I'll leave.I'm a gentleman.I know.I don't understand why you're here.That good, huh?I mean... I don't understandwhy you're dancing
at a place like Kellerman's.You should be on Broadway.Yeah, right.Why not?'Cause it would never work out.How do you know?It's easy for you to say.Your life's one big happy-ever-after.That's not true.I work my ass off.Because you believe things will work out
for you in the end.I wasn't born that way, you know.It was a choice.I mean... we're all gonna be
worm food eventually, anyway,so might as well make it count, right?Johnny? I know you're in there.I heard voices.If I want another rat bastard in my life,I'll... I'll get another husband.Ugh.Do tell.She means nothing to me.Seriously. She's a bungalow bunny.What is a bungalow bunny?They're these lonely, middle-aged womenwho stuff room keys in your pocket.And they what? Give you money?Or gifts. Depends.I don't do it for the money.It feels good to be wanted...by women like that.Classy women...who wear silk underwear and...fancy perfume.Am I a bungalow bunny?No.Where the hell were you? I looked everywhere.Did I miss something?You missed a lot.Got your head in the clouds lately.What happened?Mom said she wants a divorce.What?Well, that can't be real.I heard her tell Dad.She called a lawyer.What are we gonna do, Baby?We'll figure it out.- Yeah?
- Yeah.Your dress is undone.Your hair is...Did...Did you...Did you sleep with someone?Oh, my God.My baby sister.I haven't even done it yet.Wow. Neil doesn't seem the type.
Then again, neither do you.It wasn't Neil.Who was it? Oh, you have to tell me.- Please don't make me.
- Baby, don't make this difficult.Johnny Castle.- The dance teacher?
- Shh.- He's too old for you.
- No, he's not.Of all the guys here, why would you
give yourself to him?He taught me to dance.That's his job. He's a dance teacher.No, Lisa.You don't understand. I...I love him.This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.I don't go into yours
and you don't go into mine.This was your idea, genius.<i># Sylvia? #</i><i># Yes, Mickey? #</i><i># How you call your Lover Boy? #</i><i># Come here, Lover Boy #</i><i># And if he doesn't answer? #</i><i># Oh, Lover Boy #</i><i># And if he still doesn't answer? #</i><i># I simply say #</i><i># Baby #</i><i># O-oh, baby #</i><i># My sweet baby #</i><i># You're the one #</i><i># Baby #</i><i># Oh, baby #</i><i># My sweet baby #</i><i># You're the one #</i>Look under the bed. Check in every drawer.Hey. What the hell is this?I have the right to search
any property on the premises.Read your contract.Why? What are you looking for?One of the guests lost an item.And you think I took it?Hey, don't touch those.Hey, hey, hey, cool your jets, son.
The police are on the way.This is crazy.Uh-huh.- Grandfather.
- A Rolex.Pretty fancy timepiece on a dancer's salary.- Vivian Pressman gave it to me as a gift.
- Mm.And I turned it down.It doesn't <i>look</i> as if you turned it down.Johnny!Turns out he has a record
as long as my arm...petty larceny, grand theft auto.Max, that's terrible.People don't usually put
that stuff on their résumé.Why would he risk his job
by doing something so stupid?Exactly. Why would he do that?Maybe he needed the money.He snuck into her room last night
while she was asleep and stole it.Wait... last night?Well, that's what she says.She had it during the day,
and the next morning, it was gone.Does he have an alibi?He says he was in his room all night.By himself. Reading.You think we found any books in his room?Johnny didn't steal that watch.Honey, let's not get involved.No. I know he didn't.Baby, don't.He <i>was</i> in his room all night.And he was with <i>me</i> all night.He never left his room.Vivian Pressman came by last night,
pounding on the door.She was angry and jealous.She obviously wanted to punish him.I need to go down to the police station.Please, I need a ride.She's a grown woman.
She doesn't need my permission.<i># The way you wear your hat #</i><i># The way you sip your tea #</i><i># The memory of all that #</i><i># No, they can't take that away from me #</i><i># The way you smile just beams #</i><i># The way you sing off-key #</i><i># The way you haunt my dreams #</i><i># No, they can't take that away from me #</i><i># We may never, never meet again #</i><i># On that bumpy road to love #</i><i># Still, I'll always, always keep #</i><i># The memory of #</i><i># The way you hold your knife #</i><i># The way we danced till 3:00 #</i><i># The way you changed my life #</i><i># No, they can't take that away from me #</i><i># No, they can't take that #</i><i># Away from me. #</i>I had no idea you could play.I don't anymore.Why not?You sound great.Well, I played a little in college and...the time comes to put away childish things.You should buy a piano for the house.Not interested.Are you interested in me, Dad?I'm sorry that I didn't live up
to your expectations.I'm not perfect.I don't hang the moon.What do you want from me?I want you to be my father,not just when I'm acing
my classes and winning awardsand becoming a junior version of you.I never <i>made</i> you do anything.You didn't <i>have to, Dad.</i>I <i>wanted</i> to please you. And I still do.But I also wanna know that
you're not just gonna banish mefor making choices that you don't agree with.That... kid...the dance teacher, he's a lowlife.No, he's not!You don't even know him.He didn't get Penny pregnant.Oh, really? Well, who did?I know he didn't.- I believe him.
- Because you know him so well.Yeah. I do.The irony is, he's a lot like you, Dad.He is!He came from nothing and he knows
the value of hard work.Stealing cars?If you would just talk to him...I can't even <i>look at him!</i>I can't even look at him.He took the most precious thing
in the world to me.No, he didn't, Dad.I'm standing right here.Look, I'm going off to school soon.And I don't really know what's going on
with you and Mom.But I'm really worriedthat when you finally stop
working and lift your eyes...nobody's gonna be there.You know...I thought <i>you</i> hung the moon.Dr. Houseman?Dr. Houseman, I know I'm the last person
you wanna see right now.- You don't know anything, son.
- I know you love your daughter.And you should.She's an amazing girl.She had a great role model.She just wanted to help me and Penny.She never meant to hurt you along the way.I just want you to know I'm not
gonna screw up her lifeany more than I have already.Here's the money Baby borrowed from you...every cent.Thank you for your help with Penny.I'll always be grateful to you.- I'll drive down Saturday morning.
- Thanks, pal.Take care, Johnny.I love you, Johnny.And I always will.<i># She's like the wind #</i><i># Through my tree #</i><i># She rides the night #</i><i># Next to me #</i><i># She leads me through moonlight #</i><i># Only to burn me with the sun #</i><i># She's taken my heart #</i><i># But she doesn't know what she's done #</i><i># I feel her breath on my face #</i><i># Her body close to me #</i><i># I can't look in her eyes #</i><i># She's out of my league #</i><i># Just a fool to believe #</i><i># I have anything she needs #</i><i># She's like the wind #</i><i># I feel your breath on my face #</i><i># Your body close to me #</i><i># I can't look in your eyes #</i><i># You're out of my league #</i><i># Just a fool to believe #</i><i># Just a fool to believe #</i><i># Just a fool to believe #</i><i># Just a fool #</i>- <i># To believe #</i>

I've always loved fairy tales.But she says we need to stop
waiting for Prince Charming...wake up, live our own lives.
Be creative, you know?She sounds exactly like you.No.I don't know anything, Lisa.I just read a lot and wanna sound smart.But you can't tell other people
how to live their lives.You really miss him, don't you?Yeah.- You ready to order, Dr. Houseman?
- No. I think I'll wait for my family.I don't think they're coming, sir.Your daughters are having lunch at the lake,
and your wife said she wasn't hungry.Oh. Okay.Can I recommend the pastrami sandwich, sir?It's served on rye toast
with coleslaw and mayo.Sure. Sure, that's...That... that sounds great.All the couples I know,
married longer than five years?Maybe once a month.In the beginning, Bernie was all over me.Then one day, nada. Zip. Nothing.I knew he was cheating,
but he denied it up and down.Made me think I was crazy.I had to hire a private dick
to catch him in the act.- Oh.
- Leon would never cheat.All he needs are his golf clubs
and a gin and tonic.Marjorie. Can I talk to you?Uh, Jake, I'm in the middle of a game.This is important.Excuse me.You didn't... you didn't
have to do this, Jake.It's not for you. It's for me.I have some things I wanna say.The summer we met...my whole life lay ahead of me.I was young and strong...so full of ambition.And you were the most beautiful
girl at Kellerman's,but you were also whip-smart and kind.And I wanted to be good enough for you.You <i>were</i> good enough for me.You're a good man, Jake.You're a wonderful father.We made a good team together.Somewhere along the way,
we lost track of each other.Our job as parents is done.And I...I want more.I know, and I'm sorry.I've been so distant.And you're right.We were all over each other way back when.And then we got busy with the demands
of building a career and family,and once a week turns into
once a month and...I stopped trying. I didn't wanna be rejected.- I wouldn't have.
- I know that now.I'm still that same neighborhood kid who...would give anything
to be with someone like you.And I know things have to change.I just want that chance.This summer's been a wake-up call for me.I can't lose you, Marjorie. I can't.What's this?I thought it was time for you
to have a grown-up dress.Thanks for the new dress, Mom.It looks beautiful on you.I'm sorry about your dad.He loves you in the kind of way
that makes people act crazy.He's not ready for you to grow up,
but he doesn't have a choice.You're not the same girl
you were three weeks ago.- I'm sorry, Mom.
- No, don't be. Don't be.You didn't commit a crime. You fell in love.It happens to the best of us.Ladies and gents,take advantage of our early-bird specialand register for summer of '64
before you leave tomorrow.I always get emotional
on the last night of the season.What can I say? I love you all.- You've been my extended family...
- Honey... please put the book away.It's... it's a party.Doesn't Baby look beautiful tonight?She's going to college, Marjorie.
She wants to be called Frances.And now, in keeping
with Kellerman's tradition,our end-of-summer song.<i># Kellerman's, we come together #</i><i># Singing all as one #</i><i># We have shared another season's #</i><i># Talent, play, and fun #</i><i># Summer days will soon be over #</i><i># Soon the autumn starts #</i><i># And tonight the memories whisper #</i><i># Softly in our hearts #</i><i># Join hands and hearts and voices #</i><i># Voices, hearts, and hands #</i><i># At Kellerman's, the friendships last long#</i><i># As the mountains stand #</i><i># Join hands and hearts and voices #</i>Robbie.

- Of love.Nobody puts Baby in a corner.Come on.If you don't mind,
this'll just take a second.Come on.Sorry for the disruption, folks.This was a hell of a summer for me.I met someone who taught me a lot about life,about the kind of person I wanna be,the kind of man I wanna be.The kind of man who's not afraid
to tell the truth.I had the time of my life
with you this summer.I don't know what happens to us from here.I do know one thing...I love you.And I'm hoping you'll be willing to dance
with me one more time.Of course.<i># Now I #</i><i># Had the time of my life #</i><i># No, I've never felt like this before #</i><i># Yes, I swear it's the truth #</i><i># And I owe it all to you #</i><i># 'Cause I had the time of my life #</i><i># And I owe it all to you #</i><i># I've been waiting for so long #</i><i># Now I've finally found

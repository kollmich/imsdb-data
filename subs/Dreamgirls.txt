that can't get him to the pop charts.We can't do nothing about that.All I'm asking is one record, man.
One song with a simple hook."Look at me in my pretty car,

-Tell me something.Do you think it's right to promote
an amateur performerover a professional?I don't know what this is about.It's about fairness, Curtis.
It's about people paying their dues.Ain't that what you keep telling me?
"Get in line, Effie. Wait your turn."So why am I sitting here without
so much as a B-side on the 45when an amateur like
Martin Luther King, Jr.gets his own freakin' album?I mean, can he even sing?All right, that was a good one.You're a great man, Curtis.Isn't your brother a great man?Never met a manQuite like youDoinâ all he canMakinâ my dreams come trueYouâre strong and youâre smartYouâve taken my heartAnd Iâll give you the rest of me, tooYouâre the perfect man for mellove you, I dollove youHold it, hold it.

We want light, but not that light.Not that light?Okay, but when we fix it,
you're gonna put it in the show, right?First things first.I got to get Jimmy booked
down in Miami,even if I got to buy my own hotel.But you promised I wouldn't spend
my life singing backup, Curtis.And I still promise that.I'm not gonna let this beautiful voice
go to waste.You just got to trust me.-Can we talk about it more tonight?
-All night.-All right.
-Bye, man.All right.Boy, you're a real snake.A cheap, second-rate hustler.
Street-corner con artist.Look, you want to buy a car, Marty?
Why don't we talk about it in my office?I'm away a week,
and you cancel dates behind my back.I spent six months
setting up this tour for Jimmy.Jimmy's too big for
that Chitlin Circuit shit.I'm trying to get him booked
at the Paradise in Miami.-Miami?
-Miami.You're really drifting out there, chump.You couldn't get Sammy Davis, Jr.
in there.That place is so white, they
don't even let our boys park the cars.I got him an audition.-Luck, man. Hustler's luck.
-That's just the beginning.Then we're gonna do the Copa,
the Americana.He could even do American Bandstand.I've been in this business
too many years-to listen to some hotshot talk bullshit.
-Not bullshit, Marty. Change.I'm talking change. Can't you see?
The time is now.Jimmy needs a new act, something
classier, with a catchier sound.That'll go down better with white folks.That'll put him where he should be,making the type of money
he should be making.He's at the top of the pop charts.
He's hot.-We can do this for him.
-We?-Yeah, we.
-We do nothing.Jimmy's mine, so back off, Curtis.
Jimmy's mine.Jimmy don't belong to no one.Are you defending
this car salesman, Jimmy?Can't you see he's using you?Ain't nobody using Jimmy, all right?
Nobody.Who do you think you're
talking to, baby? It's Marty.The man who found you singing for
pennies when you were 10 years old.It's a whole new day, Marty,
and a brand new Jimmy.You want him, brother? You got him.I'm through.-Hey, what you doing?
-You can't have it all, baby.Hey, come on, Marty, don't go.
I want you to stay.I love you, Jimmy.But you can't have it all.Lady, you got to be Jewish.
Of course, yeah, of course.Itâs 105 degrees in here, and youâre
the only one wearing a mink stole.Hey, my friend, whatâs your nationality?"Nationality. " / know itâs a big word.
What are you, Cuban?Of course. Youâre Cuban.
Youâre Cuban, Iâm a Jew.You know, lsay this
from the bottom of my heart.A Negro, if he had enough money,
could move into my neighborhood.You, not a chance.Tonight, though,
we âre here to make history.The ï¬rst Negro headliners
to ever play Miami Beach.What do you think of that?Come on.
Itâs a very convenient arrangement.These are good people.
/ mean, they can sing, they can dance,they can even mop up aften/vards.
You canât ï¬nd help like that.Anyway, please give a warm round
of applause to the very talentedJimmy Early and The Dreamettes!

-What?I'm breaking you and Jimmy up.I know what you're doing, Curtis!You're breaking us up 'cause
you don't want me with Jimmy.None of you do!
Because you're all jealous!Well, nothing's breaking me

Jimmy is going back out on the road,while you stay here
and open your own act.Did you say our own act?Finally, Curtis! This is what
I've been waiting for. I love you.Oh, well, honey, I'm fine with that.
I mean, I love me some Jimmy,but I don't want to be singing

-What do you mean?-I always sing lead. Tell him, C.C.
-We're trying something new, Effie.-You knew about this?
-Curtis and I talked it over.He said it's only temporary.We finally get the chance
to have our own actand Deena's doing lead?She can't sing like I can.She's right, Curtis. I can't.I don't want to.Now, y'all gonna do what I tell you to do.
This is a new sound with a new look.New look?
Nobody can see her on a record!The only way we'll be able to change
things is by appealing to kids,and kids today watch television.So Deena's going to sing in the lead
'cause you like the way she looks?Am I ugly to you, Curtis?Baby, come on. You know
how I feel about you. Come on.-Don't make it personal.
-Well, what am I supposed to do?Deena's beautiful and she's
always been beautiful!But I've got the voice, Curtis!
I've got the voice!You can't put me in back! You just can't!Well, you'll be singing backup with me.
What's so wrong with that?Let Deena do all the work for a change.Your voice alone is too special.We need a lighter sound
to cross over to the pop charts.It's what we need.What about what I need?Curtis says it's the
best thing for the group.What about whatâs best for me?He feels The Dreams can cross over.What about how / feel?Effie, do it for me.What about me?What about me?Itâs more than youIt is more than meNo matter what we areWe are a familyThis dream is for all of usThis one can be realAnd you canât stop us nowBecause of how you feelItâs more than youIt is more than meWhatever dreams we haveTheyâre for the familyWeâre not alone anymoreNow there are others thereAnd that dream is big enoughFor all of us to shareSo don ât think youâre goingYouâre not going anywhereYouâre staying and taking your shareAnd if you get afraid againIâll be thereWe are a familyLike a giant treeBranching out toward the skyWe are a familyWe are so much moreThan just you and lWe are a familyLike a giant treeGrowing stronger, growing wiserWe are growingfreeWe need youWe are a familyLadies and gentlemen,the Crystal Room is proud to presentthe club debut of America âs newest

the talented trio.Could they be ready to record
with the Fab Four?Well, the boys will just have to wait.These girls are busy
blazing a trail across the globe.People ask me
how I came up with the sound.I tell them it's like
making a great sundae.You start outwith two scoops
of ice cream, some sauce,-and then you put a cherry on top.
-And is Deena the cherry?Why, Miss Jones is the cherry,
the nuts, the sauce, the cream-and the banana, too.
-Miss Jones, right here.We look on with shock and dismay at
the images we âre bringing you tonight.Detroit under siege and in flames

and later he'll come up and talk to you?I said, I'm fine.Excuse me. I have to get dressed now.Oh, God, I'm so nervous.I got all the steps down,

Youâre driving me wildlâm somebody, somebodyAnd nobodyâs gonna hold me downNo, nobody, nobody, nobodyâs
gonna hold me downlâm somebodyIt all started on the streets of Detroit,where three girls named
Deena, Lorre/l and Michelledreamed about one day
becoming singing stars.Since their triumphant Las Vegas debut,theyâve had No. 1 albums
for each of the last six years.And theyâre showing no signs
of slowing down anytime soon.But for Deena Jones,
none of these exciting events compareto the day she
became Mrs. Curtis Taylor, Jr.With his wife at his side,
Mr. Taylor has built his music empireinto the most successful Afro-American
business in the United States,producing such sensations
as The Family Funk,Jimmy Ear/y,and the phenomenal
Campbell Connection.Deena Jones has conquered
the worlds of music and television.And soon, she hopes to take on
her biggest challenge yet,the epic, untold story
of Cleopatra âs early yearsall set to the music of today.No, nobody, nobody, nobodyâs
gonna hold me downlâm somebodyThank you.Now, I saved the bad news
for last, Curtis.Paramount passed on Cleopatra.VVhy?Too period.And they're not convinced
Deena's got the chops.Fuck it.We'll finance the movie ourselves.I just don't know
how you're going to swing it.You're spreading yourself
too thin as it is.The music side is starting to suffer.-Music runs itself.
-Those days are over, Curtis.Just putting Deena's name on a record
don't make it a hit anymore.And our acts are dying on the road.
Especially Jimmy.-He needs new material.
-No, Jimmy needs to sober up.Wayne, start pitching the networks
on the anniversary special.We'll do a greatest hits tie-in.We'll rake in enough green
to make 10 movies,and pay for all of you
useless motherfuckers.Have a good day.-How's my beautiful wife?
-Curtis.-I'm not sure how to tell you this.
-Tell me what? Just say it.I know how much time
you've invested in this movie.But I can't play that part.I promised you I was gonna
make you a movie star, right?Cleopatra is gonna get us there.I mean, this is the queen of a nation,
not some hooker, junkie, maid.I know. I know.
It's a very important story.And it's more than you.Think about all the beautiful black
women that ain't even born yet.When they grow up they're gonna say,
"I can play any part I want to."Look at Deena Jones. She did it."But it's ridiculous. Come on.She's 16 years old
for most of the movie.Well, baby, you'll always be 16 to me.Maybe that's the problem.Maybe you just don't see me
for who I am.When / ï¬rst saw youI said, "Oh, my"lsaid, "Oh, my, thatâs a dream"Thatâs my dream"I needed a dreamWhen it all seemed to go badThen / found youAnd / have had the most
beautiful dreamsAny manâs ever hadWhen / ï¬rst saw youI said, "Oh, my"Oh, my, thatâs my dream"Thatâs my dream"I needed a dream to make me strongYou were the only reason I had to go onYou are my dreamAll the things / never knewYou are my dreamWho could believe
they could ever come true?And who would believethe world would believe
in my dreams, too?When / ï¬rst saw youI said, "Oh, my"Oh, my"Thatâs my dream"-What would make you happy, Deena?
-You know.We got plenty of time for that.Please, Curtis. Let me have your child.-Magic, read your book.
-I'm done.Then read it again!Did you look for work this week,
Miss White?Mister, you can keep
asking me that question.But the answer's always
gonna be the same.The only thing I know how to do is sing.And since there ain't nobody
letting me do that no more,no, I did not look for ajob.Have you considered asking
the girl's father for help?Magic don't have a father.Listen./ know you have questionsSame ones as meHow long has it been?
How long will it be?When will come the morning
to drive the night away?Tell me, when will come the morning
of a brighter day?YeahPatience, little sisterPatience, little brotherPatience, patience, yeahTake each other by the handYeah, yeahPatience, little sistersPatience...-It's from your brother.
-Send it back.-There's cash in here.
-You spend it.Effie White, you are a mule.Come on, baby, it's time to go to bed.Just as stubborn as your mother.Go home, old man.Magic, come on, baby.And a mountain to climbPatience, patienceItâs gonna take some timeYeah, yeahWe must walk in peaceWe got to walk in peaceItâs the onlyOnly way, yesIf we want to see that morning, yeahOf a brighter dayPatienceCome on!Little sisterPatienceLittle brotherPatience, patience, yeahIâm gonna ï¬nd a wayPatienceLittle sisterPatienceLittle brotherNice to see you, Effie.Of a brighter dayPatience-Teddy, get yourself back to the party.
-I'm waiting for Deena.It's good. It's real good.We wanted to surprise you, Curtis.That's why we went ahead
and recorded it first.This is exactly what I need
right now, Curtis.It's what you've been always
talking about to me, a new sound!Still, it's a message song.It tells the truth.
People are angry out there.I'm angry.My brother's over in Vietnam
fighting in a pointless war,and I'm angry about it.That's right, Curtis.Isn't music supposed to express
what people are feeling?Music is supposed to sell.Look, don't worry about it, Jimmy.
We'll find you some new material.Deena, I want you to meet this guy
out here.And about the shirt, you should lose it.
It's messing up your image.I'm so sorry, Jimmy.Deena.Honey, you don't need to be
doing that stuff right now.Come on, brother. It's Christmas.Jimmy? Baby?I'm not staying around for this.Brother...Yeah, but what about Holiday?I had Billie here every winter
from '42 to '58.Great voice. Bad tipper.Well, I tell you, Effie White is the best
singer this town has seen since then.Yeah, but the last time she performed,
the girl fell apart.That was years ago.She just lost her confidence for a while.
She's different now.Max, please. For the old days?They're gone, Marty.Sorry, Marty, but the babysitter was late.Effie White, this is Max Washington.Hi, Max.
Marty said you needed a singer.I was just telling Max
that you're serious about working.He knows all about you.You do, huh?
Daddy, you don't know the half.One night after you hire me,
we'll sit down and I'll tell youall about how I blew through
half a million dollars in two years!-Hey, come on.
-Drinking.You don't want to take up too much
of the man's time.-Now, Carl knows all the songs.
-Carl? Where's Bernard?He has a job in Evanston.But I can't sing
with someone I don't know.Effie. You got to.Marty, I don't have the time.Max, please. Just give me a minute.Now, you listen, Effie White.
For four months, I've been your money.I've taken you to every club
in this freezing town,and I'm telling you that this is it.It's time that you stop making excuses
so that you don't have to prove anything.You're gonna have to start proving it,
just like the rest of us.I don't know.
Maybe Curtis was right about you.You want all of the privileges
but none of the responsibilities.Hey, Max. Thanks anyway, man.
Sorry for wasting your time.Do you know the song?I told you I didn't want to see her.Well, you are, mister. You are.Look at meLook at me/ am changingTrying every way / can/ am changingIâll be better than I amIâm trying to ï¬nd a wayto understandBut I need you

-No, you're too beautiful.This movie is about three grifters
heading to Vegas for one final score.When Dawn goes down on
that truck driver,you've got to smell the desperation.I know that. That's what I love about her.There's no pretense.
No fucking bullshit.America's sweetheart here
has got a potty mouth.Of course, if I were to become involved,
we have to do a little work on the part.What do you mean?
I spent a year on the script, so...I know, and it's good.
But she's not real yet.To start with,
what kind of name is Dawn?I'm from the projects in Detroit and
I ain't ever met a sister named Dawn.Well, the script's just a blueprint.
It's not written in stone.I hear Curtis is still trying to get
that crazy black Cleopatra made.Is it true he's got some
mob money tied up in this?My husband has his hands full
with the music side right now.That's why I didn't want to bother him
with our meeting today.So, say we do decide
to get in bed with you on this,will Curtis even let you do it?I hear he's got you
on a pretty tight leash.That won't be a problem, Jerry.Step, step, step on overStep, step, step on overWanting you, wanting youNeeding you, needing youShit.-Hey.
-I didn't think it was possible, Curtis.But I think you can squeeze
even more of the soul out of my music.-We just made it danceable, that's all.
-What about the lyrics?That rhythm takes all the feeling
out of the music!This is what you've been asking for.
A totally new sound.It's gonna be bigger than R&B
and rock and roll put together!People are getting ready to boogie,and when they do
they're gonna do it to our music.Your music, Curtis.
It has nothing to do with me.Come on, brother,
you know you're my main man.Kiss my ass,brother.What the hell is going on now?No, no!The body was found at the
Tropicana Hotel in Hollywood.Police say Mr. Early had been dead
for over a day,the apparent victim
of a heroin overdose.The 43-year-old R&B singer was
recently released from his contractat Rainbow Records.She won't let me see him, Deena.She won't let me see my Jimmy.Plans are being made to fly the body
back to Detroitwhere there will be a private burial.What a thing.Bad, bad scene.Well, thanks for the drink.Tell Lorrell I'll stop by tomorrow.C.C., man, no matter what troubles
we had, you know, we're still a family.That's the most important thing.It's over, Curtis.Oh, come on, man. Jimmy did this
to himself. You know that.Michelle?0.0. can quit. You can't.What's a wake?It's when friends get together
and share their love for someone.-Mama, why are you so slow?
-'Cause I'm old, baby. I'm old.Who are you?Effie!Effie!-Who's that man?
-That's your uncle, little girl.Effie! Shit.Jimmy had so much life.First time / met him
was right here in this club.He wasnât "Thunderâ Ear/y then,
just little Jimmy.-How old was that boy, Marty?
-I don't know. Probably 12.Well, he had hands
the size of a fellow twice his age,and he wasnât shy
about using them either.Yeah, Jimmy was a real little shit.-A real little shit.
-Shit.lmiss you, old friendCan I hold you?And though itâs been a long time
Old friendDo you mind?There were so many things/ wish / had saidlmeant to love youBut I hurt you insteadIâve come here nowTo make amendsCan I sit down beside you?Can we be close again?âCause I, lmiss you, old friendCan I hold you?And though itâs been a long time
Old friendEffie?What gives you the nerve, C.C.,
coming here after all of these years?Effie, all I can say is I was young
and I made a mistake.I'm telling you. I won't be used.
Not by you, not by anybody.I promised you I would write you
a hit song.

-Well, Nicky said thatthe song's only got local distribution.
Detroit stations mostly.C.C. wrote it,
so that means we own it, right?Well, technically, yeah.Look, I'll get the lawyers
to draw up an agreement,we'll demand half the royalties.No, no. This is the perfect song
to launch my new sound.I want Deena to re-record it
with the girls.Come on, Curtis,
the song's already moving.If I can buy a hit, I can buy a flop.Hey, man. This is Effie's big break.-There's other songs.

Cecil Osborne finally committed.And he's soaking me
for a million bucks, but I don't care,because he's great with actors,
Cleopatra is your first movie,and I don't want anything
but the best for you, sweetheart.What's wrong?Nothing, Curtis. I guess
I never thought it would really happen.You made it happen!I mean, you are the queen of disco.Maybe I'm just tired.Yeah, you got your interviews
and your photo shoot with Vogue,private meetings by the pool.You think I'm stupid?When was you gonna tell me?I'm sorry, Curtis.
I know I should have talked to you.It's just that this part is perfect.It's exactly the kind of movie
I should be making.Curtis, baby, nobody knows music
the way you do.It's in your blood.But movies are different.Deena, you know why
I chose you to sing lead?Because your voicehas no personality, no depth.Except for what I put in it.See, nobody knows you like I do.Well, they offered me the part
and I'm taking it.Do you read contracts,
or are you just pretty?You can't even take a shit and wipe
your own ass unless I say it's okay.-Well, I'll get myself a lawyer.
-What do you think they're gonna do?You think them honkies
are gonna wait aroundwhile you try to drag me into court?Forget about it! It's over!Listen, I don't want
those men handling you,because they don't know how.And, Deena,I forgive you.Curtis will always be here for you.Listen to the song here in my heartA melody I start but canât completeListen to the sound from deep withinItâs only beginning to ï¬nd releaseOh, the time has come

And you're still a second-class snake.First-class to you.
Gentlemen, give me a break.Why, Curtis? Did you give Effie one?-I could kill you for what you did to her.
-You couldn't kill shit.I assume you guys have a reason
for barging in hereother than to insult me.Mr. Taylor, we're planning to go
to the federal authorities.Yeah, we'll tell the feds how
you killed Effie's record. Payola, man.You remember, Curtis, Iwitnessed it all.The whole dirty operation going back
to Steppin' to the Bad Side.That's right you did,
but who's going to believe you?All you are is a guy that's pissed off
'cause you got fired.We have documented evidence,
Mr. Taylor.Falsified sales records
to cheat investors out of their profits,goods-quality merchandise listed
as cutouts to disguise the fraud,mob-backed loans,and a payola operation
stretching back 11 years.Who gave you this?Believe me, I had no idea
what Curtis was trying to do to you.Effie, are you all right?I'm happy now, Deena.
I have a child who loves me.-You have a baby?
-Magic's not exactly a baby anymore.She's almost nine now.I wanted to tell you.
At the time, I really wanted to tell you.Deena, he doesn't know.Effie, Effie, Effie.Well, I see you're just as much trouble
as you ever were.Hello, Curtis.You haven't changed much, either.Actually, I take that back.
You are looking a little heavy, baby.You could lose some weight.I'll deal with you later.Mr. Taylor agrees it's in everyone's
interest to resolve the situationwithout resorting
to draconian legal measures.Say that in English.Nationwide distribution of our
version of One Night Only, Effie.-On our own label.
-That sounds good to me.And remember, Curtis,
if these negotiations fall apartyou're going straight to jail.That's right, Curtis.You stopped me once,
but you'll never stop me again.âCause this timeEfï¬e Whiteâs gonnawinDeena! Get your ass out here!Hello, Curtis.Hey, May. What are you doing here?
I mean, I thought you said you hate LA.Oh, I do. But my daughter said
she needed me, so I'm here.Go wait in the car, Mama.That was a dirty trick you pulled on me.I had to do something
to stop you, Curtis.-How could you do that to Effie?
-I had to do what I had to.Where do you think you're going?Out looking for a new sound, baby,
just like you.-You can't leave.
-Why? Because you own me?You can sue me.
You can take everything I have!It don't matter, 'cause I'll start over.It don't matter, 'cause I'll start over.
Effie did it and so can I.Listen, I'm not living without you.
I love you.I'm sorry, Curtis.
I can't do this anymore.Good bye.Good to see you, Curtis.Mr. Taylor?Mr. Taylor, this must be
a bittersweet night.How does it feel
to say goodbye to The Dreams?I don't believe in goodbyes, just hellos.And I want you all to say hello
to Tania Williams.We're releasing Tania's first album

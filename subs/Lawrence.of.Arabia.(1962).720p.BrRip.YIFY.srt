1
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,500
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Did you know him well?

3
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,500
I knew him.

4
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,420
Well, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,500
But did he really deserve...

6
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,900
a place in here?

7
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,020
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,140
What, more words?

9
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,700
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,420
played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,300
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,700
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,700
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,540
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,300
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,740
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Thank you.

18
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,700
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,740
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,100
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,340
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,740
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?

23
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,900
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,500
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,300
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,820
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,300
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,700
this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
That's right.

30
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,300
We are not happy in it.

31
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,220
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,700
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.

33
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,700
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,300
- Here you are, Tosh.
- Thanks.

35
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,300
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,940
- Is it there?
- Of course.

37
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,700
Headlines.

38
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,300
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,100
" Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,540
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,300
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,700
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.

43
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,100
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,020
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,900
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,900
And you're balmy!

47
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,300
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,300
What's the trick, then?

49
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,420
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,500
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,900
tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,700
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.

53
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,820
Lawrence.

54
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,740
Yes?

55
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,700
You're supposed to be...

56
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,380
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,220
Always.

58
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,540
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,100
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,140
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,300
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,940
Where are you going?

64
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,500
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,420
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,900
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Sorry.

68
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,100
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,420
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,020
thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,380
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss.

72
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,860
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,540
There is, indeed.

74
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,620
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,820
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,500
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,580
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,300
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,540
giving military advice.

82
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,620
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,420
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to...

84
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,420
To what?

85
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,020
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,140
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,060
that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,540
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,540
They did attack Medina.

90
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,020
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.

91
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,540
We don't know that.

92
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,060
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,540
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,020
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,940
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,500
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,220
would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,980
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,220
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,740
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,700
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,500
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,300
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.

104
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,300
Good morning, sir.

105
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,900
Salute.

106
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,220
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,140
- It's my manner.
- Your what?

108
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,140
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,180
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,300
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.

111
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,780
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,620
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,180
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,100
" I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,420
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.

116
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,100
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,500
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,660
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,900
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,140
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,700
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,900
Yes, what is it?

123
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,740
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,900
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,020
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,900
But there must be artillery!

127
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,940
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,180
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,900
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,100
- Two months, then.
- Three.

131
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,500
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,300
Thank you, sir.

133
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,900
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am gratef ul for this.

134
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,940
Shut up and get out.

135
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,100
Sir?

136
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,620
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,340
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,940
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.

139
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,940
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,820
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,820
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,900
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,700
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,340
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,700
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,300
That's new.

147
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,100
Where are they now?

148
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,100
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,740
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,500
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,620
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,900
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,500
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither.
Take it from me.

154
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,900
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,700
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,540
It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,100
Here you may drink.

158
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,900
One cup.

159
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,900
You do not drink?

160
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
No.

161
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,500
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,420
I am Bedu.

163
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,940
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,500
Yes.

165
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,700
From Cairo?

166
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,500
Yes.

167
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,100
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.

168
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,100
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,100
And before?

170
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,100
From Britain?

171
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,700
Yes.

172
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,300
Truly?

173
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,140
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,500
Is that a desert country?

175
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,620
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,300
You are not fat?

177
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,100
No.

178
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,100
I'm different.

179
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,300
Here...

180
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,500
take it.

181
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,620
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,300
Take it now.

183
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,700
Bedu food.

184
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,700
Good.

185
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,100
More?

186
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,100
- Bedu.
- Where?

187
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,700
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,100
Yes, I know.

189
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,140
- I am not Harith.
- No.

190
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,900
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,940
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,700
When you are ready to go...

193
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,900
hit her on the shoulder
and say, " Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,340
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,060
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,740
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,100
Now!

198
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,900
Good?

199
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,900
It's all right.

200
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,100
This is a Harith well.

201
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,900
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,500
Turks?

203
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,980
Bedu.

204
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,300
Who is he?

205
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,300
He is dead.

206
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,100
Yes.

207
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,380
Why?

208
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,500
This my well.

209
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,620
I have drunk from it.

210
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,220
You are welcome.

211
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,140
He was my friend.

212
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,100
- That?
- Yes, that.

213
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,900
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.

214
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,100
His?

215
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,900
Mine.

216
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,300
Then I will use it.

217
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,020
Your friend...

218
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,100
was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,700
I know.

220
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,180
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,660
I have heard of you.

222
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,900
So...

223
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,940
what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,500
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,300
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.

226
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,100
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,300
I can both read and write.

228
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,700
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,700
What is your name?

230
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,100
My name is for my friends.

231
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,340
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
You are angry, English.

233
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,300
He was nothing.

234
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,300
The well is everything.

235
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,100
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,900
He knew that.

237
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,300
Salaam.

238
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,380
Sherif Ali.

239
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,700
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,340
so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,900
a silly people.

242
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,420
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Come.

244
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,500
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,100
Wadi Saf ra is another day from here.

247
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,340
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,300
I will find it with this.

249
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,500
Good army compass.

250
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,900
How if I take it?

251
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,540
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,980
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,300
My fear is my concern.

254
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,100
Truly.

255
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,900
God be with you, English.

256
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,220
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air

257
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,260
You can hear the girls declare

258
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,220
He must be a millionaire

259
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,660
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo

260
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,820
Hey, you!

261
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,460
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?

262
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,860
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

263
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,420
How did he know?

264
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,420
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

265
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,620
I'll give him that. No escort?

266
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,220
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

267
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,220
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.

268
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,820
Bloody savages.

269
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,460
- This is Wadi Saf ra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.

270
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,140
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

271
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,220
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

272
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,020
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

273
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,020
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

274
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,420
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awf ul.

275
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,660
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

276
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,740
the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

277
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,260
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

278
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,060
What I want to say is this:

279
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,820
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

280
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,820
you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

281
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,620
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

282
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,620
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.

283
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,620
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

284
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,820
Oh, my God.

285
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,220
Not again.

286
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,940
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

287
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,220
" Move South, " I've said.
"You're still in range."

288
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,420
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

289
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,140
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

290
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,420
Fire back at them.

291
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,500
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

292
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,340
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

293
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,700
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

294
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,220
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

295
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,220
You were right and I was wrong.

296
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,460
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

297
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,820
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- lf they can get to Yenbo.

298
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,500
They can hardly come with us.

299
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,860
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

300
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,860
Lawrence.

301
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,420
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence...

302
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,500
my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

303
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,820
First the guns, and now this.

304
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,420
Cigarette?

305
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,020
I'm sorry.

306
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,140
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

307
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,300
Umph off.

308
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,820
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

309
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,900
Hold it, Jenkins!

310
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,420
Jenkins!

311
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,020
Lawrence?

312
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,620
You have no servant.

313
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,260
- I don't need a servant.
- No?

314
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,060
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

315
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,220
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.

316
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,420
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.

317
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,820
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

318
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,580
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

319
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,620
while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

320
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,940
Others do battle in His cause.

321
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,340
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

322
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,620
And observe the prayers.

323
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,980
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

324
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,820
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

325
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,420
Verily, God is forgiving, mercif ul--

326
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,020
Greetings, Ali.

327
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,940
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.

328
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,220
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

329
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,820
Yes, my lord.

330
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,420
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

331
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,860
" By the noonday brightness...

332
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,140
and by the night
when it darkeneth...

333
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,700
thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

334
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,260
neither hath He been displeased.

335
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,620
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

336
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,220
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

337
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,620
and thou be satisfied."

338
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,820
So?

339
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,860
Yes, colonel.

340
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,820
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

341
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,620
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

342
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,580
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

343
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,700
You could supply us through Aqaba!

344
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,620
Aqaba!

345
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,940
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

346
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,060
- But you can't!
- You could.

347
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,020
You mean, the navy?

348
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,060
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

349
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,220
Can you imagine what that means?

350
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,100
Yes, I can imagine.

351
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,340
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

352
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,980
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

353
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,220
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

354
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,180
You can see that, sir, surely.

355
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,220
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

356
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,380
It is of little consequence to us.

357
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,820
I must ask you not to speak like that.

358
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,580
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

359
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,500
Possibly.

360
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,260
Upon my word, sir, you're ungratef ul.

361
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,020
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

362
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,340
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

363
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,340
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.

364
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,340
No. Guns. Artillery.

365
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,700
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

366
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,860
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

367
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,620
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

368
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,460
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

369
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,620
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanized army.

370
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,180
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

371
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,580
I think it is far from Damascus.

372
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,060
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

373
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,140
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

374
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,060
Yes, my lord.

375
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,620
It is beautif ul, is it not?

376
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,500
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.

377
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,660
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

378
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,740
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

379
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,180
Small population compared with some.

380
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,420
It's small, but it's great. And why?

381
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,380
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.

382
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,620
Because it has a navy, because of this,
the English go where they please...

383
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,340
and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

384
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

385
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,020
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

386
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
But I would like to hear his opinion.

387
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,820
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

388
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,340
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

389
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,620
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

390
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,220
My lord, I think...

391
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,220
I think your book is right.

392
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,740
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

393
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,540
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they
please and strike where they please.

394
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,940
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

395
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,980
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

396
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,260
And this is the way you should
fight now.

397
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,020
I don't know.

398
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,420
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

399
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,140
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

400
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,460
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.

401
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,660
No, colonel.

402
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,020
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

403
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,220
They must say their say.

404
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,100
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

405
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,740
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

406
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,420
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

407
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,220
You tread heavily...

408
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,820
but you speak the truth.

409
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,740
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

410
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,820
it is late.

411
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,220
Colonel Brighton means to put my men
under European officers, does he not?

412
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,260
In effect, my lord, yes.

413
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,420
And I must do it...

414
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,620
because the Turks have
European guns.

415
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,420
But I fear to do it...

416
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,420
upon my soul I do.

417
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,260
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

418
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,540
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

419
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,620
Then you must deny it to them.

420
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,300
You are an Englishman.
Are you not Ioyal to England?

421
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
To England and to other things.

422
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,460
To England and Arabia both?

423
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,420
And is that possible?

424
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,940
I think you are another of these
desert-Ioving English.

425
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,220
Doughty, Stanhope...

426
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,020
Gordon of Khartoum.

427
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,420
No Arab loves the desert.

428
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,420
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

429
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,820
And no man needs nothing.

430
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,260
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

431
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,940
because we are a little people,
a silly people...

432
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,220
greedy, barbarous and cruel?

433
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,660
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

434
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,260
were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

435
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,140
when London was a village.

436
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,060
Yes, you were great.

437
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,340
Nine centuries ago.

438
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,660
Time to be great again, my lord.

439
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,020
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

440
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,860
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

441
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,220
But my father is old...

442
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,820
and I...

443
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,020
I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

444
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,620
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

445
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,620
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

446
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,860
or...

447
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,420
Or?

448
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,420
What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence.

449
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,020
We need a miracle.

450
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,700
Aqaba.

451
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,420
Aqaba.

452
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,780
From the land.

453
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,420
You are mad.

454
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,020
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nef ud Desert.

455
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,420
That's right.

456
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,820
The Nef ud cannot be crossed.

457
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,820
I'll cross it if you will.

458
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,020
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

459
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,940
The Nef ud is the worst place
God created.

460
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,020
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

461
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,860
Fifty men?

462
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,540
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

463
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,060
If 50 men came out of the Nef ud...

464
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,220
they would be 50 men
other men might join.

465
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,220
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

466
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,420
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

467
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,820
- Good fighters, though.
- Good--

468
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,020
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

469
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,220
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

470
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,020
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

471
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,060
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

472
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,820
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

473
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,020
Aqaba's over there.

474
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,620
It's only a matter of going.

475
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,940
You are mad.

476
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,220
And where are you going, lieutenant?

477
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,460
With 50 of my men.

478
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,180
To work your miracle.

479
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,620
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

480
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,780
- Who told you?
- Ali did.

481
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,620
Why not you?

482
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,060
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

483
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,460
Yes, I must.

484
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,620
But I will spare these to you.

485
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,420
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

486
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,820
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

487
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,100
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

488
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,340
No.

489
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,620
Since you do know...

490
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,500
we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

491
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,020
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

492
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,820
But in whose name do you ride?

493
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,860
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

494
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,220
They were here. I caught them.

495
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,220
Why are you here? Boy!

496
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,260
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

497
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,020
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

498
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,020
You have been tracking us.

499
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,820
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.

500
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,020
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

501
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,060
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

502
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,820
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.

503
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,260
Don't do that.

504
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,220
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

505
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,420
Be warned. They are not suitable.

506
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,260
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

507
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:18,100
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

508
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,660
One shilling, every week?

509
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,420
That is fair.

510
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,340
- Each?
- No.

511
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,100
- That is too much.
- All right.

512
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,380
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

513
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,420
There is the railway.

514
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,060
And that is the desert.

515
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,020
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

516
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,380
For the camels, no water at all.

517
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,020
If the camels die...

518
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,620
we die.

519
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,220
And in 20 days they will start to die.

520
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,620
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

521
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,100
I was thinking.

522
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,980
You were drifting.

523
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,380
Yes. It will not happen again.

524
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,180
Be warned, you were drifting.

525
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,780
It will not happen again.

526
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,180
That water is wasted.

527
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,580
From now on,
we must travel by night...

528
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,620
and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

529
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,180
A few hours each day.

530
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,780
Why don't we start now?

531
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,580
No. We will rest now.

532
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,420
Three hours.

533
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,980
Fine.

534
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,980
I'll wake you.

535
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,300
Do we rest here?

536
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,580
There is no rest now short of water.

537
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,780
The other side of that.

538
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,980
And how much of that is there?

539
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,780
I'm not sure.

540
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:04,980
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

541
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,180
This is the sun's anvil.

542
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,220
Have we done it?

543
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,420
No, but we're off the anvil.

544
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,780
Thank God for that anyway.

545
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,780
Yes, thank Him.

546
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,500
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.

547
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,980
I know.

548
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,620
We've done it.

549
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,380
God willing.

550
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,380
When do we reach the wells?

551
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,780
God willing, midday.

552
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,500
- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

553
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,580
Gasim's.

554
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,980
What's happened to him?

555
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,180
God knows.

556
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,580
Why don't you stop?

557
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,380
For what? He will be dead by midday.

558
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,180
We must go back.

559
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:38,180
What for, to die with Gasim?

560
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,580
In one hour comes the sun.

561
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:47,500
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

562
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,980
I can.

563
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,380
Take the boys.

564
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,380
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

565
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,780
Gasim you have killed already.

566
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,540
Get out of my way.

567
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,580
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

568
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,060
Nothing is written!

569
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,420
Go back, then!

570
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,980
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

571
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,780
English blasphemer!

572
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,380
Aqaba?

573
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,580
Was it Aqaba?

574
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,980
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

575
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,500
Go back, blasphemer...

576
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,940
but you will not be at Aqaba.

577
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,980
I shall be at Aqaba.

578
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,180
That is written.

579
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,980
In here.

580
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,180
English!

581
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,980
English!

582
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,780
Lawrence! Daud!

583
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,980
Nothing is written.

584
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,380
Al Lawrence.

585
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,980
Farraj.

586
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,180
Wash.

587
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:35,500
Al Lawrence.

588
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:40,380
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

589
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,700
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

590
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,540
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.

591
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,980
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

592
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,700
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

593
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,580
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.

594
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,580
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

595
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:10,980
No.

596
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,740
You have an elder brother.

597
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:21,180
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,500
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,580
I see.

600
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:29,380
I'm sorry.

601
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:35,020
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

602
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,900
Yes, I suppose I am.

603
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,820
Al Lawrence is best.

604
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,580
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

605
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,980
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,780
Very fine.

607
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:40,620
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,180
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.

609
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,980
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

610
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:03,820
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,940
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,780
As you see.

613
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,020
Are you alone?

614
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,980
Almost.

615
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,620
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

616
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,180
Yours?

617
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,380
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:21,780
I've heard of another man
of that name.

619
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,300
Other? What other?

620
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:28,660
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,100
He must be a great hero.

622
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:35,980
He is.

623
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,220
He wouldn't ref use water to men coming
out of Nef ud Desert.

624
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,580
Now, would he not?

625
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:46,780
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,980
Here is my help.

627
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,180
Son, what fashion is this?

628
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:22,980
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?

629
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,860
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,220
And is he Harith?

631
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,580
No, Father, English.

632
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,980
Son...

633
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,780
they are stealing our water.

634
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,380
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,180
Tell them.

636
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,860
- Empty that!
- Do not!

637
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:54,140
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,820
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

639
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,580
Harith.

640
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,580
Ali.

641
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,380
Does your father still steal?

642
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,580
No.

643
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,980
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

644
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:30,180
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,300
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,540
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.

647
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:39,380
I knew your father well.

648
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,580
Did you know your own?

649
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:49,340
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

650
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,780
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

651
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:56,940
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,380
nor the sultan himself desire that.

653
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,500
Call off your men.

654
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:12,380
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,700
I've only just begun to teach him.

656
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:19,020
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

657
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,180
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,980
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.

659
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:38,100
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.

660
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,780
Is he your tongue?

661
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,180
We do desire it.

662
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:48,180
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,420
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:56,180
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:01,180
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the Turks
to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,580
But...

667
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,300
dine with me.

668
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,020
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,220
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:16,540
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:53,180
This thing you work against Aqaba...

672
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,820
what profit do you hope from it?

673
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,540
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,780
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:05,460
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,380
he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

677
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:11,420
But I...
I cannot serve.

678
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,180
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

679
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:17,340
Yes, it is my pleasure.

680
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:25,460
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:26,940
No?

682
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:30,500
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.

683
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:32,460
The Arabs?

684
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:37,340
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,460
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,540
But the Arabs?

687
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,060
What tribe is that?

688
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:49,660
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

689
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,820
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,860
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,300
Who work only for profit.

692
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,100
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,820
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

694
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,140
Serve?

695
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,580
I serve?

696
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,340
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,060
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

698
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,060
- Does Auda serve?
- No!

699
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:18,300
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!

700
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:26,700
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

701
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:30,500
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

702
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:34,700
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,860
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

704
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:43,060
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,540
Is that service?

706
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,260
No.

707
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:04,100
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

708
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,900
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,100
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

710
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,900
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,820
Why should they wish to?

712
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:19,940
Now...

713
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:24,540
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,900
a servant's wages.

715
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:30,940
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:35,060
100 golden guineas.

717
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:39,260
150, Auda.

718
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:42,260
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.

719
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,660
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:48,100
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

721
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,940
A trifle which they take
f rom a great box they have.

722
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,060
In Aqaba.

723
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,860
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?

724
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,460
You trouble me like women.

725
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:04,860
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda won't come to Aqaba.

726
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,580
- For money?
- No.

727
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,060
- For Feisal?
- No!

728
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,180
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,740
He will come...

730
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,860
because it is his pleasure.

731
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:22,260
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:26,900
Make God your agent!

733
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,300
Aqaba!

734
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,100
Aqaba!

735
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:49,060
God be with you.

736
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,500
God be with you.

737
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,860
God be with you.

738
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,260
God be with you.

739
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:01,020
Yes.

740
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:02,340
Aqaba.

741
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:06,460
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:10,420
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.

743
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:13,260
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:42,660
He killed. He dies.

745
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,460
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:50,940
- One of our men murdered Auda's man.
- Why?

747
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:54,060
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

748
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,660
Ali!

749
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,820
It is an ancient wound.

750
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,860
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

751
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:07,220
It is the law, Lawrence.

752
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:09,620
The law says the man must die.

753
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:13,460
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

754
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,660
Yes.

755
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:20,500
Sherif Ali!

756
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,540
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

757
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:27,020
- ...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.

758
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,460
Then I will execute the law.

759
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,460
I have no tribe.

760
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,860
And no one is offended.

761
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:54,780
Gasim.

762
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,460
Did you do it?

763
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,860
Well, Lawrence...

764
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,420
What ails the Englishman?

765
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,940
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nef ud.

766
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:42,060
It was written, then.

767
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:44,780
Better to have left him.

768
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,460
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

769
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,060
Besides, it was necessary.

770
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:57,220
You gave life and you took it.

771
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,260
The writing is still yours.

772
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,940
Auda Abu Tayi!

773
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:53,060
The miracle is accomplished.

774
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:55,580
Garlands for the conqueror.

775
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,580
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

776
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:14,980
I'm none of those things, Ali.

777
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:17,740
- What, then?
- Don't know.

778
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:19,980
Thanks.

779
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,540
My God, I love this country.

780
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:26,140
What!

781
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:28,940
No gold in Aqaba!

782
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,540
Auda, I found it!

783
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,940
That's a pity.

784
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:48,780
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

785
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:51,380
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

786
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:54,620
and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

787
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:55,940
And you?

788
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:59,140
I'm going to tell the generals...

789
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:01,340
in Cairo.

790
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:03,780
Yes, cross Sinai.

791
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,020
Come on!

792
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,620
Sinai?

793
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,340
Yes.

794
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:12,340
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.

795
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:21,380
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

796
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:24,380
"We've taken Aqaba, "
the generals would laugh.

797
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,340
I see.

798
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,940
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

799
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:34,180
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
ofour quaintness and barbarity...

800
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:36,940
and then they will believe you.

801
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,540
You're an ignorant man.

802
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,140
Paper.

803
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:02,740
Paper!

804
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:07,940
There is no gold in Aqaba.

805
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,740
No gold.

806
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,940
No great box!

807
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:20,180
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

808
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:22,940
For my pleasure, as you said.

809
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:26,540
But gold is honorable...

810
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:30,140
and Lawrence promised gold.

811
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:32,300
Lawrence lied.

812
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,540
See, Auda.

813
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,140
"The Crown of England...

814
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,540
promises to pay...

815
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:48,740
5000 golden guineas...

816
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:53,740
to Auda Abu Tayi."

817
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:58,940
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

818
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:00,540
by...

819
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:03,340
me.

820
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:06,420
In 10 days...

821
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,140
I'll be back with the gold.

822
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:14,780
With gold, with guns, with everything.

823
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,340
Ten days.

824
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,140
You'll cross Sinai?

825
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,740
Why not?

826
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:24,100
Moses did.

827
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:28,740
And you will take the children?

828
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,300
Moses did.

829
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,140
Moses was a prophet...

830
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,140
and beloved of God.

831
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:45,140
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

832
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:49,140
He is not perfect.

833
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:01,140
Lord, can we not rest?

834
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:04,340
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

835
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,140
Have you two slept in beds?

836
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:09,540
Farraj?

837
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,340
Daud?

838
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,140
With sheets?

839
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:19,300
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

840
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:20,780
I promise.

841
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:23,540
Then it shall be so, lord.

842
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:45,340
Look!

843
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:53,340
Pillar of fire.

844
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:58,340
No, lord. Dust.

845
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,340
My compass.

846
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:50,340
No matter.

847
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:54,340
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

848
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:56,740
Due west.

849
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:17,940
Come on!

850
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:52,540
Lawrence!

851
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:05,980
Farraj!

852
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:18,580
Farraj, don't! Don't!

853
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:20,940
Don't!

854
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:53,660
Why do you walk?

855
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:58,140
But why, lord?

856
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:10,220
But why, lord?

857
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:13,740
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

858
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:40,820
Lawrence, look!

859
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:48,900
It's all right, Farraj.

860
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:50,580
It's all right.

861
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:01,380
Who are you?

862
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:05,980
Who are you?

863
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:42,420
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.

864
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:01,380
You taking him in there?

865
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:03,780
Yes.

866
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,780
Here!

867
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:28,900
Here. You!

868
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:33,740
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

869
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:35,900
We are thirsty.

870
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:39,980
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

871
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:43,380
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.

872
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,780
You can't take him in there, sir.

873
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:52,740
What do you think you look like?

874
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,220
No, no. You must go.

875
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,940
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

876
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:18,380
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

877
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:24,020
We want two large glasses of lemonade.

878
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:27,940
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.

879
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:36,780
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.

880
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:40,540
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.

881
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:43,420
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

882
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:46,500
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.

883
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,180
What's going on?

884
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:56,780
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.

885
01:56:58,060 --> 01:56:59,580
Explain yourself.

886
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:01,940
We've taken Aqaba.

887
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:05,020
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.

888
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:09,580
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

889
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:11,580
We have.

890
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,060
He likes your lemonade.

891
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:17,260
You mean the Turks have gone?

892
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:20,340
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

893
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:24,780
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

894
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:27,380
That's not true. We killed some.

895
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:31,380
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

896
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:35,460
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

897
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:40,820
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

898
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:43,700
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.

899
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:45,780
I did it.

900
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,420
You'd better talk to Allenby.

901
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:55,340
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.

902
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:57,740
That's a step in the right direction.

903
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:01,100
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

904
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:03,980
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.

905
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:08,420
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

906
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:10,580
See Allenby first, though.

907
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,780
Will he see me?

908
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:14,980
I think so.

909
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,180
Do that, then.

910
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:24,380
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.

911
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:27,100
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

912
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:39,580
" Undisciplined.

913
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:43,260
Unpunctual.

914
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:46,220
Untidy.

915
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:50,020
Several languages.

916
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:53,180
Knowledge of music...

917
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:55,700
literature.

918
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:58,620
Knowledge of...

919
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:01,620
Knowledge of..."

920
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:07,580
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

921
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:11,180
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.

922
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:14,020
- Sir.
- Sir.

923
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,540
Then why did you?

924
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:18,140
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?

925
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:20,780
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.

926
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:24,980
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

927
01:59:25,180 --> 01:59:29,580
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.

928
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:31,140
True.

929
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:35,780
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

930
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:38,900
Am I going for Jerusalem?

931
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:40,380
Yes.

932
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:43,980
Very well.

933
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:46,380
Aqaba behind my right.

934
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:49,380
It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.

935
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:51,980
Anything else?

936
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:53,380
Yes.

937
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:55,980
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

938
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,420
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

939
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:03,060
No. I think you should
leave them there.

940
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:05,180
You acted without orders, you know.

941
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:09,900
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

942
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:12,380
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

943
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,820
Yes, I know.

944
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,580
Already?

945
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:17,980
Yes.

946
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:22,180
I'm promoting you major.

947
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:25,300
I don't think that's a very good idea.

948
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:28,460
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

949
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:32,180
and carry on the good work.

950
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:35,380
No. Thank you, sir.

951
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:39,660
- Why not?
- Well, l, it's...

952
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:41,180
Let me see now...

953
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:46,380
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

954
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:48,740
One was a boy.

955
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:50,340
That was...

956
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:53,660
yesterday.

957
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:55,820
I led him into a quicksand.

958
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:57,660
The other was a man.

959
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:59,820
That was...

960
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:02,380
before Aqaba, anyway.

961
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:05,580
I had to execute him with my pistol.

962
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:09,020
There was something about it
I didn't like.

963
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:12,260
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.

964
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:16,700
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

965
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:18,900
No. Something else.

966
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:22,020
What, then?

967
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:25,140
I enjoyed it.

968
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:35,740
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

969
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:40,900
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

970
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:42,740
Yes. Entirely.

971
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:45,980
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

972
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:48,220
Fascinating gear they wear.

973
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:50,620
How would I look in this, Harry?

974
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:54,180
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.

975
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:58,980
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

976
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:01,940
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

977
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:07,340
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

978
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:10,540
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.

979
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:14,860
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

980
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:17,980
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

981
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:21,180
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

982
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:24,460
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!

983
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:27,180
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

984
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:34,340
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.

985
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:38,660
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

986
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:41,780
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!

987
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:48,780
Come on, then.

988
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,980
You're a clever man, sir.

989
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:57,740
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

990
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:00,580
That's fair, surely?

991
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:25,140
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

992
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:27,580
- Bravo.
- You know better?

993
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:49,060
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

994
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:51,580
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

995
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,980
Easy, gentlemen, please.

996
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:32,260
- Give us a drink.
- Of course, sir.

997
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:36,180
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

998
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:38,060
Tracy.

999
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:41,660
Shall we go outside?

1000
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:55,500
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

1001
02:04:55,740 --> 02:04:56,740
Yes.

1002
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:59,180
With 1000 Arabs?

1003
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:03,220
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1004
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:05,340
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1005
02:05:05,860 --> 02:05:07,460
It means 1000 camels.

1006
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:11,820
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1007
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:15,980
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1008
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:18,380
I'll smash his railways.

1009
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:21,020
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1010
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:23,940
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1011
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,460
You are going back, then?

1012
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:30,380
Yes.

1013
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:32,980
Of course I'm going back.

1014
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:39,500
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1015
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:43,820
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handf ul of bandits...

1016
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:45,140
he'll withdraw.

1017
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:47,980
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1018
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:50,620
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1019
02:05:50,860 --> 02:05:53,260
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.

1020
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:55,980
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1021
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:03,980
That's what I've told them anyway.

1022
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:06,180
That's what they think.

1023
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:09,740
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.

1024
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:14,780
They've only one suspicion.

1025
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:19,380
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1026
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:23,940
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1027
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:25,140
Have we?

1028
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:27,740
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1029
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:30,940
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1030
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:34,060
Difficult question, sir.

1031
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:39,620
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1032
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:43,060
that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1033
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:45,540
Certainly.

1034
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:05,660
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1035
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:06,980
Right.

1036
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:10,460
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1037
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:14,660
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.

1038
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:16,380
More money.

1039
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:19,740
- How much more?
- 25, 000 now. A lot more later.

1040
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:22,540
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.

1041
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:25,460
A couple of armoured cars.

1042
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:26,980
Right.

1043
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:29,180
Field artillery.

1044
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:32,580
Right.

1045
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:37,580
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

1046
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:40,580
because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1047
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:43,380
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1048
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:19,380
Congratulations!

1049
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:32,220
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1050
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:34,180
I was wondering that, sir.

1051
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:36,500
Might be difficult to get it back.

1052
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:40,140
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1053
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:42,220
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1054
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:44,300
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.

1055
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:47,180
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1056
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:49,260
Not like that poor devil.

1057
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:51,260
He's riding the whirlwind.

1058
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:53,580
Let's hope we're not.

1059
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:28,260
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1060
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:29,980
To Prince Feisal.

1061
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:32,860
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.

1062
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:34,380
You know him though?

1063
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:37,900
He is my master. I am his servant.

1064
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:42,220
Can you read?

1065
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:54,860
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1066
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:58,500
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1067
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:13,220
Now...

1068
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:18,180
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?

1069
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:20,420
Not altogether, sir, no.

1070
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:24,860
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1071
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:28,060
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1072
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:29,420
I don't know.

1073
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:32,620
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?

1074
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:36,540
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1075
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:39,940
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.

1076
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:42,500
A void Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1077
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:45,380
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1078
02:10:45,580 --> 02:10:46,820
They do.

1079
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:50,100
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1080
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:51,820
Myself...

1081
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:54,260
I am going to Cairo.

1082
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:56,380
- As you know.
- Yes.

1083
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:58,980
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1084
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:00,700
Yes.

1085
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,380
I know you've been
given no artillery.

1086
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:09,260
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?

1087
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:11,420
It restricts us to small things.

1088
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:12,860
It's intended to.

1089
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:17,020
Do you know General Allenby?

1090
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:21,300
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1091
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:24,180
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.

1092
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:27,220
Slim customer. It's very good.

1093
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:31,860
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1094
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:35,460
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1095
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:37,980
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1096
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,300
who struggle for their freedom.

1097
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:42,620
Very gratifying.

1098
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:49,420
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1099
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:51,820
I badly want a story to tell.

1100
02:11:52,060 --> 02:11:55,660
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1101
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:59,060
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1102
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:01,140
And before I leave here...

1103
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:03,620
which must be presently...

1104
02:12:03,820 --> 02:12:07,220
I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1105
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:12,060
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1106
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:13,340
I do, sir.

1107
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:16,380
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1108
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:18,980
My army is made up of tribes.

1109
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:22,060
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1110
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:25,300
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1111
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:28,420
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1112
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:32,220
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1113
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:36,300
the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1114
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:39,020
beyond every other man.

1115
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:42,700
One figure I can give you
f rom my head...

1116
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:46,420
because it never leaves my head.

1117
02:12:46,900 --> 02:12:50,780
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1118
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:54,020
37 wounded...

1119
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:59,660
156 dead.

1120
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:05,780
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1121
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:07,220
Yeah.

1122
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:08,860
Four times as many.

1123
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:13,620
That's because those too badly wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1124
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:16,220
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1125
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:20,180
- You mean...?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1126
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:23,900
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1127
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:28,420
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1128
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:30,460
and are treated harshly.

1129
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:32,180
How harshly?

1130
02:13:32,420 --> 02:13:35,220
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1131
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:36,940
I see.

1132
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:40,220
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1133
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:44,100
can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1134
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:48,220
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.

1135
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:51,700
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1136
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:53,460
Why should you suppose?

1137
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:56,020
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1138
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:58,580
Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1139
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:00,380
That is exactly so.

1140
02:14:00,580 --> 02:14:03,940
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1141
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:07,020
With me, it is merely good manners.

1142
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:11,180
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1143
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:15,060
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.

1144
02:14:18,980 --> 02:14:20,580
Thank you, sir.

1145
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:22,460
Can you manage the letter--?

1146
02:14:22,700 --> 02:14:25,460
I'll do everything I have said...

1147
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:29,060
if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1148
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,580
in my people and Major Lawrence.

1149
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:36,420
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1150
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:39,060
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1151
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:40,340
Oh, no.

1152
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:44,220
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1153
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:47,060
to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1154
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:49,180
And Turkey.

1155
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:53,580
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is...

1156
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:56,420
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.

1157
02:14:56,620 --> 02:14:59,540
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1158
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:03,180
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1159
02:15:04,700 --> 02:15:06,460
All right. Yes.

1160
02:15:07,060 --> 02:15:08,620
Lawrence is your man.

1161
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:47,860
Stop!

1162
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:08,020
Stop it!

1163
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:10,140
Stop it!

1164
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:19,420
Come on, men!

1165
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:27,020
Lawrence!

1166
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:48,820
Good God! God!

1167
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:37,860
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1168
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:40,260
Why don't you take a picture?

1169
02:18:40,660 --> 02:18:41,860
Wish I had.

1170
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:48,060
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1171
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:51,180
Am I in this?

1172
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:53,820
Did you take his picture?

1173
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:55,260
Yeah.

1174
02:18:59,460 --> 02:19:03,460
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1175
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:07,820
Charming company you keep.

1176
02:19:08,060 --> 02:19:09,260
Auda?

1177
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:14,860
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1178
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:17,180
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1179
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:19,460
It's all right to take your picture?

1180
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:21,460
- All right.
- Okay.

1181
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:23,060
Just walk.

1182
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:22,860
Major Lawrence!

1183
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:26,060
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1184
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:36,260
This looting has got to stop!

1185
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:37,780
It is customary.

1186
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:41,460
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1187
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,860
I would not say that to Auda.

1188
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:46,980
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.

1189
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:49,860
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1190
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:53,900
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.

1191
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:02,460
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1192
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,260
They'll come back.

1193
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:07,900
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1194
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:10,260
Not this year, Lawrence.

1195
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:15,180
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you
think you'll have left? 200?

1196
02:21:15,420 --> 02:21:18,060
- Less.
- Well, then?

1197
02:21:18,420 --> 02:21:20,660
I said, they'll come back.

1198
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:22,460
You badly hurt?

1199
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:25,660
Not hurt at all.

1200
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:29,860
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1201
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:48,660
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1202
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:52,460
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.

1203
02:21:53,140 --> 02:21:57,420
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1204
02:21:58,060 --> 02:22:00,260
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1205
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:03,700
Did I answer well?

1206
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:08,060
You answered without saying anything.
That's politics.

1207
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,900
You learn quickly.

1208
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:14,260
I have a good teacher.

1209
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:18,060
Yeah.

1210
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:27,260
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.

1211
02:22:27,460 --> 02:22:32,100
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1212
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:35,260
may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1213
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:38,700
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1214
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:40,060
One.

1215
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:44,260
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1216
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:46,860
They hope to gain their freedom.

1217
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:49,140
Freedom.

1218
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:53,060
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1219
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:56,820
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.

1220
02:22:57,540 --> 02:22:59,660
I'm going to give it to them.

1221
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:02,420
The second question?

1222
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:06,860
Well, I was going to ask...

1223
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:11,140
what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1224
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:14,180
It's clean.

1225
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:19,260
Well, now...

1226
02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:22,140
that's a very illuminating answer.

1227
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:24,060
May I...

1228
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:27,060
take one farewell picture?

1229
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:30,780
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1230
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:33,860
One clock for two lamps.

1231
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,500
A fair bargain.

1232
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:38,260
Fair? I robbed him.

1233
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:50,660
Trash.

1234
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:54,100
I must find something honorable.

1235
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:55,860
Honorable?

1236
02:23:56,420 --> 02:24:00,060
The year is running out, Brighton.

1237
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:07,140
I must find something honorable.

1238
02:26:32,460 --> 02:26:34,580
Now you may blow up my train.

1239
02:26:34,820 --> 02:26:36,460
And what will you do now?

1240
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:41,060
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1241
02:26:41,820 --> 02:26:43,740
They will carry my toys too, see?

1242
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:47,060
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1243
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:50,540
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1244
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:55,180
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1245
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:57,860
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1246
02:26:58,100 --> 02:26:59,660
No, I shan't, Auda.

1247
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:01,780
Then you are a fool.

1248
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:05,300
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1249
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:08,460
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1250
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:11,660
that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.

1251
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:14,860
You are an impudent rascal.

1252
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:20,460
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1253
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:32,100
Like talking to a brick wall.

1254
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:42,980
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1255
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:45,260
I'll go north.

1256
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:48,300
That's what Allenby wants.

1257
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:52,460
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1258
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:54,860
Then that's where I'll take it.

1259
02:27:55,820 --> 02:28:00,500
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1260
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:01,860
Won't we?

1261
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:34,020
Train, Farraj.

1262
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:36,460
Yeah, Lawrence.

1263
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:06,260
Hide yourself, my friend.

1264
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:16,460
Detonator.

1265
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:31,060
All right, fetch another.

1266
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:34,860
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1267
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:41,460
Farraj?

1268
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:54,260
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!

1269
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:08,420
He cannot ride.

1270
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:21,460
If they take him alive, you know what
they'll do to him.

1271
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:35,660
Daud will be angry with you.

1272
02:30:36,660 --> 02:30:38,460
Salute him for me.

1273
02:30:57,420 --> 02:30:59,060
What will you do now?

1274
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:01,860
Go north.

1275
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:03,460
With twenty?

1276
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:06,660
What would you recommend me to do?

1277
02:31:08,340 --> 02:31:10,260
What would you recommend?

1278
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:17,260
He hasn't 1l10 so many men, sir.

1279
02:31:17,460 --> 02:31:19,260
He's lied, in fact.

1280
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:24,100
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1281
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:26,860
Then there is an Arab north army.

1282
02:31:28,340 --> 02:31:32,660
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?

1283
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:36,860
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.

1284
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:40,660
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1285
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:43,460
No.

1286
02:31:44,460 --> 02:31:48,060
He would if he could, I think.

1287
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:53,060
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1288
02:31:53,740 --> 02:31:55,900
What matters is I believed it.

1289
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:57,780
The Turks believe it.

1290
02:31:58,020 --> 02:32:01,260
They are offering 20, 000 pounds
for him.

1291
02:32:03,140 --> 02:32:04,860
Good heavens.

1292
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:08,860
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Well, he's a brave man--

1293
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:13,260
Surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1294
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:17,060
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1295
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:22,660
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1296
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:24,780
I wouldn't be surprised.

1297
02:32:25,020 --> 02:32:28,500
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?

1298
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:45,940
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.

1299
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:49,580
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1300
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:54,300
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.

1301
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:56,660
So say they love you.

1302
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:59,460
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1303
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:02,660
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1304
02:33:02,860 --> 02:33:04,940
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1305
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:08,260
That's right. That's right.

1306
02:33:08,860 --> 02:33:11,260
Who are you to know what can be done?

1307
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:15,180
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1308
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:20,020
Whatever I ask them to do can be done.
They know that if you don't.

1309
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:24,860
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1310
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:26,660
Do you?

1311
02:33:29,740 --> 02:33:32,940
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1312
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:40,460
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.

1313
02:33:40,660 --> 02:33:42,660
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1314
02:33:42,900 --> 02:33:46,460
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?

1315
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:48,500
I told the English generals...

1316
02:33:48,740 --> 02:33:52,220
the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1317
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:54,660
Or perhaps you are here...

1318
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:57,140
for the English generals.

1319
02:33:59,100 --> 02:34:00,700
Who says this?

1320
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:02,260
Rumour.

1321
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:05,900
That is not an argument.

1322
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:08,260
Oh, argument.

1323
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:11,700
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1324
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:14,260
while the Arabs argue.

1325
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:19,100
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1326
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:23,100
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1327
02:34:31,940 --> 02:34:33,140
It's madness.

1328
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:38,180
What are you looking for?

1329
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:40,780
Some way to announce myself.

1330
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:42,860
Be patient with him, God.

1331
02:34:55,740 --> 02:34:59,820
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1332
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:01,260
Halt!

1333
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:02,660
Walk on.

1334
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:04,660
- Halt!
- Walk on.

1335
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:07,860
You and you.

1336
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:45,860
You.

1337
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:03,660
You have blue eyes.

1338
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:08,580
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.

1339
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:11,940
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.

1340
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:14,300
How old are you?

1341
02:37:14,540 --> 02:37:17,460
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1342
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:19,460
I think.

1343
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:24,060
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1344
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:27,260
It's an interesting face.

1345
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:34,060
I am surrounded by cattle.

1346
02:37:34,700 --> 02:37:38,260
He wouldn't know an interesting face
f rom a sow's belly.

1347
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:43,060
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1348
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:47,460
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1349
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:49,460
isolated.

1350
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:53,780
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

1351
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:55,660
No, effendi.

1352
02:37:58,140 --> 02:37:59,460
Have you?

1353
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:01,860
No.

1354
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:04,300
That would be too...

1355
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:06,060
lucky.

1356
02:38:29,540 --> 02:38:31,260
Where did you get that?

1357
02:38:33,060 --> 02:38:37,060
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.

1358
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:41,180
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.

1359
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:43,260
Yes, you are a deserter.

1360
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:46,460
But from which army?

1361
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:51,060
Not that it matters at all.

1362
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:53,620
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1363
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:06,500
Your skin is very fair.

1364
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:25,860
Beat him.

1365
02:40:56,540 --> 02:40:57,860
To me!

1366
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:56,860
Sleep.

1367
02:42:58,540 --> 02:43:00,060
Sleep.

1368
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:12,660
Eat.

1369
02:43:18,260 --> 02:43:19,460
Eat.

1370
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:25,860
You have a body, like other men.

1371
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:35,060
Good.

1372
02:43:36,140 --> 02:43:37,860
Then sleep.

1373
02:43:50,820 --> 02:43:52,060
Better?

1374
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:55,260
Much better. You were right.

1375
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:57,580
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1376
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,460
Oh, I've learned all right.

1377
02:44:06,020 --> 02:44:07,660
I'm going, Ali.

1378
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:10,700
- Why?
- Why?

1379
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:13,180
Heavens.

1380
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:14,660
Why?

1381
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:17,660
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1382
02:44:17,900 --> 02:44:19,860
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1383
02:44:20,100 --> 02:44:23,100
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1384
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:26,260
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1385
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:29,380
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1386
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:31,460
You proved it.

1387
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:33,780
Look, Ali. Look.

1388
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:37,660
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1389
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:40,620
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1390
02:44:40,820 --> 02:44:43,380
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1391
02:44:45,060 --> 02:44:46,460
He can...

1392
02:44:46,660 --> 02:44:49,460
but he can't want what he wants.

1393
02:44:50,340 --> 02:44:53,460
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1394
02:44:56,140 --> 02:44:59,780
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1395
02:45:00,020 --> 02:45:03,780
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1396
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:06,660
- I tried to.
- So would any man.

1397
02:45:06,860 --> 02:45:10,260
Well, any man is what I am.

1398
02:45:11,220 --> 02:45:15,060
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1399
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:17,260
that any man can do.

1400
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:19,380
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1401
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:22,220
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?

1402
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:27,060
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1403
02:45:28,740 --> 02:45:33,100
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

1404
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:34,860
ordinarily...

1405
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,860
happy.

1406
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:42,060
Can I take this?

1407
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:44,500
It is not clean.

1408
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:47,660
No, but it's warm.

1409
02:45:48,060 --> 02:45:49,260
And these...

1410
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:53,260
having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1411
02:45:54,700 --> 02:45:59,700
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1412
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:03,940
And let me go back to mine.

1413
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:34,860
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.

1414
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:42,260
Mind if I join you?

1415
02:46:43,060 --> 02:46:44,660
Honoured, sir.

1416
02:46:46,900 --> 02:46:50,060
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.

1417
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:53,060
- What's doing out there?
- Where?

1418
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:55,460
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.

1419
02:46:55,700 --> 02:46:58,900
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1420
02:46:59,140 --> 02:47:01,460
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1421
02:47:01,660 --> 02:47:03,060
Jolly good.

1422
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:07,660
Well, I have to go up there.

1423
02:47:08,620 --> 02:47:10,980
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1424
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:12,860
Bloody wogs.

1425
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:16,060
Yes, probably.

1426
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:19,020
Jolly good about the squash court.

1427
02:47:21,660 --> 02:47:24,060
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1428
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:37,860
Morning.

1429
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:39,860
- Good morning.
- Good to be back.

1430
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:43,060
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.

1431
02:47:46,180 --> 02:47:47,460
Hello.

1432
02:47:48,060 --> 02:47:51,060
Morning. You're to go right in.

1433
02:48:02,580 --> 02:48:03,780
Lawrence.

1434
02:48:05,700 --> 02:48:08,140
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1435
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:09,780
Sir.

1436
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:17,460
Well, general, I will leave you.

1437
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:20,460
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1438
02:48:20,740 --> 02:48:24,380
about my people
and their weakness...

1439
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:29,220
and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

1440
02:48:31,620 --> 02:48:35,020
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1441
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:37,180
I told you, no such treaty exists.

1442
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:41,700
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1443
02:48:41,900 --> 02:48:43,860
I know this treaty does exist.

1444
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:45,060
Treaty, sir?

1445
02:48:48,020 --> 02:48:49,940
He does it better than you, general.

1446
02:48:50,180 --> 02:48:53,340
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1447
02:49:06,940 --> 02:49:08,500
You really don't know?

1448
02:49:10,700 --> 02:49:12,620
Then what the devil's this?

1449
02:49:13,620 --> 02:49:17,340
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1450
02:49:17,540 --> 02:49:21,260
Why? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1451
02:49:21,460 --> 02:49:22,540
No.

1452
02:49:23,500 --> 02:49:26,540
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.

1453
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:29,620
Well, now...

1454
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:32,940
Mr. Sykes is as English civil servant.

1455
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:36,140
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1456
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:40,380
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1457
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:43,860
France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1458
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:45,780
Including Arabia.

1459
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:49,940
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1460
02:49:50,140 --> 02:49:53,140
An agreement to that effect.

1461
02:49:53,740 --> 02:49:57,180
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1462
02:49:57,420 --> 02:50:00,060
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1463
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:03,300
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1464
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:06,980
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1465
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:11,460
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1466
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:16,220
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1467
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:19,940
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1468
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:22,740
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1469
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:26,060
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1470
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:28,540
That's my reason for resigning.

1471
02:50:29,780 --> 02:50:31,340
It's personal.

1472
02:50:31,540 --> 02:50:33,660
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.

1473
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:36,860
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1474
02:50:37,100 --> 02:50:40,340
And as it happens,
a damned important one. Are you mad?

1475
02:50:40,580 --> 02:50:43,660
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1476
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:45,140
That's my reason too.

1477
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:50,860
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...

1478
02:50:51,060 --> 02:50:52,940
and you are part of it.

1479
02:50:53,420 --> 02:50:56,940
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1480
02:50:57,180 --> 02:51:00,900
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1481
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:03,580
What about your Arab friends?

1482
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:07,460
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1483
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:09,780
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1484
02:51:09,980 --> 02:51:14,900
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1485
02:51:15,140 --> 02:51:17,940
- Lawrence.
- Yes?

1486
02:51:20,540 --> 02:51:23,180
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1487
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:25,460
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1488
02:51:25,700 --> 02:51:27,340
Thank you, sir.

1489
02:51:28,380 --> 02:51:30,500
Why don't we...?

1490
02:51:32,980 --> 02:51:34,740
There's blood on your back.

1491
02:51:35,940 --> 02:51:38,940
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

1492
02:51:40,060 --> 02:51:42,140
Tell me what happened.

1493
02:51:46,900 --> 02:51:48,940
Say, what goes on in there?

1494
02:51:49,700 --> 02:51:51,540
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!

1495
02:51:51,740 --> 02:51:55,060
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?

1496
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:59,060
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1497
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:03,020
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1498
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:06,540
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.

1499
02:52:06,780 --> 02:52:09,380
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1500
02:52:09,620 --> 02:52:13,740
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1501
02:52:14,220 --> 02:52:16,940
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1502
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:19,860
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1503
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:22,780
Always walking away, aren't you?

1504
02:52:23,020 --> 02:52:24,500
Well, I'll tell you.

1505
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:27,540
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1506
02:52:27,740 --> 02:52:30,540
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1507
02:52:30,780 --> 02:52:33,420
and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1508
02:52:34,220 --> 02:52:37,140
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1509
02:52:37,620 --> 02:52:41,140
when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1510
02:52:41,980 --> 02:52:44,740
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1511
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:46,780
Leave me alone.

1512
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:49,460
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.

1513
02:52:49,660 --> 02:52:52,140
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.

1514
02:52:52,380 --> 02:52:55,020
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1515
02:52:56,940 --> 02:52:57,980
What of it?

1516
02:52:58,340 --> 02:53:00,940
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1517
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:04,140
It's a terrible thing
for a man to funk it if he has.

1518
02:53:04,340 --> 02:53:06,380
Are you speaking from experience?

1519
02:53:06,660 --> 02:53:07,780
No.

1520
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:09,940
You're guessing, then.

1521
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:12,340
Suppose you're wrong.

1522
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:15,540
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1523
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:19,140
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all--

1524
02:53:21,620 --> 02:53:22,620
The 16th?

1525
02:53:22,940 --> 02:53:25,740
Can you do it?
I'll give you a lot of money.

1526
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:28,740
- Artillery?
- I can't.

1527
02:53:29,900 --> 02:53:32,740
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1528
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:35,140
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1529
02:53:36,180 --> 02:53:38,140
Which I'm going to give them.

1530
02:53:38,820 --> 02:53:40,540
That's all I want.

1531
02:53:41,540 --> 02:53:44,340
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1532
02:53:44,540 --> 02:53:48,660
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1533
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:51,940
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1534
02:53:52,180 --> 02:53:54,460
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1535
02:53:54,660 --> 02:53:55,940
Fair enough.

1536
02:53:56,420 --> 02:53:59,220
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1537
02:53:59,900 --> 02:54:01,740
It's going to happen.

1538
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:04,420
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1539
02:54:05,100 --> 02:54:06,740
All there is.

1540
02:54:07,220 --> 02:54:08,740
Not that much.

1541
02:54:11,900 --> 02:54:14,540
The best of them won't come for money.

1542
02:54:16,460 --> 02:54:17,700
They'll come for me.

1543
02:54:35,420 --> 02:54:36,660
No pictures!

1544
02:54:36,900 --> 02:54:39,140
It's not for you, it's for Lawrence.

1545
02:54:39,380 --> 02:54:43,380
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1546
02:54:43,580 --> 02:54:45,740
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1547
02:54:50,020 --> 02:54:52,540
Have you met Lawrence
since he's come back?

1548
02:54:52,780 --> 02:54:53,780
Yes.

1549
02:54:53,980 --> 02:54:56,460
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.

1550
02:54:56,660 --> 02:54:59,420
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1551
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:07,540
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1552
02:55:08,220 --> 02:55:12,780
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1553
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:16,860
What did the English
do to him in Jerusalem?

1554
02:55:17,100 --> 02:55:18,740
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1555
02:55:18,940 --> 02:55:20,780
- I did.
- What did he say?

1556
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:22,540
He laughed.

1557
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:25,540
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1558
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:27,580
He offered me money.

1559
02:55:27,820 --> 02:55:29,340
Did you take it?

1560
02:55:30,100 --> 02:55:32,580
No. But many did.

1561
02:56:08,780 --> 02:56:11,740
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.

1562
02:56:12,380 --> 02:56:14,940
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1563
02:56:15,180 --> 02:56:18,660
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.

1564
02:56:18,900 --> 02:56:20,780
The sheiks will hang these men.

1565
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:22,740
These men are mine.

1566
02:56:23,220 --> 02:56:27,380
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1567
02:56:27,700 --> 02:56:30,980
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?

1568
02:56:31,220 --> 02:56:34,060
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.

1569
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:36,100
Aye, but for what?

1570
02:56:36,300 --> 02:56:38,420
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1571
02:56:41,380 --> 02:56:44,580
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.

1572
02:56:44,820 --> 02:56:47,460
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1573
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:50,540
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1574
02:56:54,380 --> 02:56:56,140
Damascus!

1575
02:56:56,380 --> 02:56:58,380
Damascus! Damascus!

1576
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:01,540
Damascus! Damascus!

1577
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:37,460
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1578
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:41,180
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1579
02:57:41,380 --> 02:57:44,940
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--

1580
02:57:45,140 --> 02:57:45,940
Certainly.

1581
02:57:46,140 --> 02:57:47,900
He can't be far from Mallud...

1582
02:57:48,540 --> 02:57:52,660
in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1583
02:57:52,900 --> 02:57:54,820
Splendid. Philip.

1584
02:57:55,220 --> 02:57:57,780
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1585
02:57:58,020 --> 02:58:01,420
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1586
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:05,580
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1587
02:58:05,780 --> 02:58:06,780
Any questions?

1588
02:58:07,220 --> 02:58:11,140
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1589
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:13,740
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1590
02:58:13,940 --> 02:58:15,740
Where are they now?

1591
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:21,140
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.

1592
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:23,620
Pound them, Charley.

1593
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:25,540
Pound them.

1594
02:58:35,700 --> 02:58:38,380
God help the men who lie under that.

1595
02:58:38,620 --> 02:58:40,180
They're Turks.

1596
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:41,980
God help them.

1597
02:59:22,940 --> 02:59:26,540
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1598
02:59:26,780 --> 02:59:27,780
Cocky?

1599
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:29,940
More than cocky, sir.

1600
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:33,380
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1601
02:59:33,620 --> 02:59:36,940
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1602
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:39,340
- Unless...
- Unless?

1603
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:43,260
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1604
02:59:43,500 --> 02:59:46,340
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.

1605
02:59:49,220 --> 02:59:51,340
I wonder where they are now.

1606
03:01:29,220 --> 03:01:30,340
No prisoners.

1607
03:01:33,700 --> 03:01:35,740
Damascus, Lawrence.

1608
03:01:45,220 --> 03:01:47,940
Lawrence, not this.

1609
03:01:48,620 --> 03:01:52,500
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1610
03:01:53,180 --> 03:01:54,740
No prisoners.

1611
03:02:04,420 --> 03:02:05,980
This was Talaal's village.

1612
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:11,940
Talaal!

1613
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:22,740
Talaal!

1614
03:02:31,420 --> 03:02:33,340
No prisoners!

1615
03:02:33,780 --> 03:02:34,820
No prisoners!

1616
03:02:46,220 --> 03:02:47,220
God.

1617
03:02:51,100 --> 03:02:52,140
God.

1618
03:02:54,180 --> 03:02:55,340
God!

1619
03:05:07,180 --> 03:05:10,220
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1620
03:06:43,620 --> 03:06:44,820
Major!

1621
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:47,020
Major Lawrence!

1622
03:06:52,460 --> 03:06:54,020
Jesus wept.

1623
03:07:08,980 --> 03:07:10,180
Jesus wept.

1624
03:07:12,020 --> 03:07:13,980
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1625
03:07:14,580 --> 03:07:17,220
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1626
03:07:17,460 --> 03:07:19,220
Barbarous and cruel.

1627
03:07:19,980 --> 03:07:21,820
Who but they?

1628
03:07:22,180 --> 03:07:23,460
Who but they?

1629
03:07:25,700 --> 03:07:28,020
Oh, you rotten man.

1630
03:07:29,020 --> 03:07:33,220
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1631
03:07:35,260 --> 03:07:37,260
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1632
03:08:02,660 --> 03:08:06,020
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1633
03:08:06,460 --> 03:08:08,060
Damascus!

1634
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:10,060
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1635
03:08:10,300 --> 03:08:11,620
Tell him.

1636
03:08:12,580 --> 03:08:14,220
Remind him.

1637
03:08:15,060 --> 03:08:18,020
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.

1638
03:08:18,820 --> 03:08:21,020
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1639
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:24,020
They are not ripe.

1640
03:08:29,700 --> 03:08:31,660
General salute!

1641
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:34,020
Present arms!

1642
03:08:47,780 --> 03:08:49,580
Port arms!

1643
03:08:52,260 --> 03:08:54,060
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1644
03:08:54,300 --> 03:08:57,020
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1645
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:04,820
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.

1646
03:09:05,020 --> 03:09:06,820
They've been here a day and a night.

1647
03:09:07,060 --> 03:09:09,460
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1648
03:09:09,700 --> 03:09:13,420
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1649
03:09:14,300 --> 03:09:16,060
What else beside the town hall?

1650
03:09:16,300 --> 03:09:19,060
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1651
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:21,620
hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1652
03:09:21,820 --> 03:09:24,620
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1653
03:09:24,820 --> 03:09:26,420
and they're in the town hall.

1654
03:09:26,660 --> 03:09:29,420
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1655
03:09:31,060 --> 03:09:32,460
What should we do?

1656
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:34,980
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1657
03:09:35,820 --> 03:09:37,620
How about that, Dryden?

1658
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:41,940
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1659
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:45,580
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1660
03:09:45,780 --> 03:09:47,740
By special train in two days' time.

1661
03:09:47,980 --> 03:09:49,020
Two days.

1662
03:09:49,220 --> 03:09:52,660
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1663
03:09:52,900 --> 03:09:54,860
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.

1664
03:09:55,060 --> 03:09:58,340
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.

1665
03:09:58,580 --> 03:10:02,060
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1666
03:10:02,300 --> 03:10:06,420
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1667
03:10:06,780 --> 03:10:08,340
Does that apply to technical units?

1668
03:10:08,580 --> 03:10:10,620
Technical units particularly.

1669
03:10:10,860 --> 03:10:12,060
Yes, sir.

1670
03:10:12,700 --> 03:10:14,060
Medicals too, sir?

1671
03:10:14,300 --> 03:10:16,420
I'm af raid so, Harry.

1672
03:10:16,740 --> 03:10:18,420
Medicals too.

1673
03:10:57,100 --> 03:10:58,620
We here...

1674
03:10:58,820 --> 03:11:01,580
are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1675
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:04,820
nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1676
03:11:05,100 --> 03:11:08,420
of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1677
03:11:08,660 --> 03:11:10,620
He insulted me.

1678
03:11:11,700 --> 03:11:15,620
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1679
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:18,580
and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1680
03:11:19,020 --> 03:11:22,620
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1681
03:11:22,820 --> 03:11:26,220
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1682
03:11:28,580 --> 03:11:30,820
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1683
03:11:31,700 --> 03:11:35,020
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1684
03:11:37,660 --> 03:11:41,420
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1685
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:42,820
Humbly?

1686
03:11:43,300 --> 03:11:44,660
Humbly, Harith?

1687
03:11:44,900 --> 03:11:46,820
Yes, humbly.

1688
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:49,220
This is a new trick.

1689
03:11:50,180 --> 03:11:51,780
Why is there no electricity?

1690
03:11:52,700 --> 03:11:55,340
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1691
03:11:55,580 --> 03:11:58,340
There are three large machines.

1692
03:11:58,580 --> 03:12:00,820
He means generators!

1693
03:12:01,300 --> 03:12:02,420
So.

1694
03:12:02,820 --> 03:12:04,460
One of them is burning.

1695
03:12:04,700 --> 03:12:07,700
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1696
03:12:07,980 --> 03:12:10,620
It is so of all machines.

1697
03:12:10,820 --> 03:12:14,660
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1698
03:12:17,220 --> 03:12:20,260
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.

1699
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:24,020
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1700
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:25,420
Take--

1701
03:12:29,380 --> 03:12:30,580
Fire has broken out.

1702
03:12:30,780 --> 03:12:32,260
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.

1703
03:12:32,500 --> 03:12:35,260
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!

1704
03:12:35,500 --> 03:12:37,140
Then use the fire brigade!

1705
03:12:37,380 --> 03:12:40,140
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1706
03:12:40,380 --> 03:12:41,820
Then you must carry it.

1707
03:12:42,060 --> 03:12:46,220
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?

1708
03:12:58,020 --> 03:13:01,420
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1709
03:13:04,180 --> 03:13:05,820
This afternoon!

1710
03:13:28,580 --> 03:13:32,420
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.

1711
03:13:32,620 --> 03:13:36,420
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?

1712
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:39,420
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1713
03:13:40,820 --> 03:13:42,060
Sorry, sir.

1714
03:13:44,220 --> 03:13:45,820
Maybe it's the bulb.

1715
03:13:50,300 --> 03:13:51,420
No, sir.

1716
03:13:51,820 --> 03:13:53,420
It's the power.

1717
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:09,340
They're leaving.

1718
03:14:09,980 --> 03:14:11,620
That's it, then.

1719
03:14:12,100 --> 03:14:14,140
Marvellous-Iooking beggars,
aren't they?

1720
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:37,220
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1721
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:39,420
- Come where?
- Back.

1722
03:14:43,660 --> 03:14:45,820
I know your heart.

1723
03:14:53,900 --> 03:14:55,460
What is it?

1724
03:14:56,420 --> 03:14:58,020
Is it this?

1725
03:15:00,660 --> 03:15:03,620
I tell you, this is nothing.

1726
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:17,860
Is it the blood?

1727
03:15:18,620 --> 03:15:21,620
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1728
03:15:23,100 --> 03:15:27,260
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1729
03:15:28,300 --> 03:15:29,540
Hear me, God.

1730
03:15:31,180 --> 03:15:34,860
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1731
03:15:51,060 --> 03:15:52,260
What about you?

1732
03:15:53,220 --> 03:15:56,700
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1733
03:15:59,100 --> 03:16:00,420
A very low occupation.

1734
03:16:00,900 --> 03:16:03,820
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1735
03:16:12,420 --> 03:16:15,220
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1736
03:16:15,420 --> 03:16:17,220
It's what I came for.

1737
03:16:20,580 --> 03:16:21,820
And then...

1738
03:16:24,100 --> 03:16:25,420
it would be something.

1739
03:16:25,660 --> 03:16:26,820
Yes.

1740
03:16:27,460 --> 03:16:28,620
Much.

1741
03:16:46,900 --> 03:16:49,220
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.

1742
03:16:49,420 --> 03:16:50,660
- You love him.
- I fear him.

1743
03:16:50,900 --> 03:16:52,620
Then why do you weep?

1744
03:16:52,980 --> 03:16:55,020
If I fear him, who love him...

1745
03:16:55,220 --> 03:16:58,020
how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1746
03:16:58,380 --> 03:17:01,380
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1747
03:17:03,700 --> 03:17:07,020
So you are not yet
entirely politician.

1748
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:08,060
Not yet.

1749
03:17:08,300 --> 03:17:12,460
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1750
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:14,820
And Allah be thanked.

1751
03:17:15,300 --> 03:17:16,660
I'll tell thee what...

1752
03:17:16,900 --> 03:17:20,100
being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1753
03:17:40,700 --> 03:17:43,900
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1754
03:17:44,180 --> 03:17:46,860
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1755
03:17:47,100 --> 03:17:51,260
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1756
03:17:51,500 --> 03:17:54,420
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1757
03:17:54,660 --> 03:17:56,180
No, sir, I will not.

1758
03:17:57,060 --> 03:17:58,620
Control yourself.

1759
03:17:59,100 --> 03:18:02,060
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1760
03:18:02,980 --> 03:18:05,180
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1761
03:18:05,380 --> 03:18:08,100
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1762
03:18:08,460 --> 03:18:12,740
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1763
03:18:13,380 --> 03:18:17,820
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1764
03:18:24,260 --> 03:18:25,660
What's it like?

1765
03:19:39,340 --> 03:19:41,340
This is outrageous!

1766
03:19:42,380 --> 03:19:44,220
Outrageous!

1767
03:19:47,300 --> 03:19:48,980
Outrageous!

1768
03:19:50,020 --> 03:19:52,140
You filthy little wog!

1769
03:20:02,220 --> 03:20:06,140
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1770
03:20:06,380 --> 03:20:08,740
" My friend Lawrence."

1771
03:20:08,980 --> 03:20:13,380
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1772
03:20:13,580 --> 03:20:16,140
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1773
03:20:16,380 --> 03:20:21,260
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1774
03:20:21,500 --> 03:20:24,980
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1775
03:20:25,220 --> 03:20:28,580
and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1776
03:20:28,820 --> 03:20:32,140
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1777
03:20:33,020 --> 03:20:35,140
You're promoted colonel.

1778
03:20:35,340 --> 03:20:37,700
Yes. What for?

1779
03:20:37,900 --> 03:20:40,980
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1780
03:20:41,180 --> 03:20:45,140
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1781
03:20:45,700 --> 03:20:47,900
Then, thank you.

1782
03:20:51,940 --> 03:20:53,140
Well, then...

1783
03:20:53,700 --> 03:20:54,700
Godspeed.

1784
03:20:55,180 --> 03:20:58,940
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1785
03:20:59,220 --> 03:21:03,140
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1786
03:21:03,380 --> 03:21:07,580
Young men make wars, and the virtues
of war are the virtues of young men.

1787
03:21:07,820 --> 03:21:11,140
Courage and hope for the future.

1788
03:21:11,340 --> 03:21:13,940
Then old men make the peace.

1789
03:21:14,980 --> 03:21:17,780
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1790
03:21:17,980 --> 03:21:20,340
Mistrust and caution.

1791
03:21:21,220 --> 03:21:22,980
It must be so.

1792
03:21:38,740 --> 03:21:43,140
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1793
03:21:52,500 --> 03:21:56,020
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1794
03:21:56,260 --> 03:21:57,940
The pumping plant I must retain.

1795
03:21:58,140 --> 03:22:00,580
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1796
03:22:00,820 --> 03:22:04,380
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.

1797
03:22:04,620 --> 03:22:08,340
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1798
03:22:08,580 --> 03:22:10,180
- Have you men?
- Enough of that.

1799
03:22:10,380 --> 03:22:12,700
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1800
03:22:13,020 --> 03:22:14,780
I'm sure your government...

1801
03:22:15,020 --> 03:22:18,740
does not wish to appear at
the peace conference as an aggressor.

1802
03:22:20,900 --> 03:22:22,340
I say!

1803
03:22:23,700 --> 03:22:25,540
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1804
03:22:27,780 --> 03:22:29,940
May I shake your hand, sir?

1805
03:22:31,020 --> 03:22:33,540
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1806
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:39,140
Haven't we met before?

1807
03:22:39,380 --> 03:22:40,900
Don't think so, sir.

1808
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:43,740
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1809
03:22:48,740 --> 03:22:52,740
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1810
03:22:52,940 --> 03:22:54,860
They have no power. It's illusory.

1811
03:22:55,100 --> 03:22:57,460
Illusions can be very powerf ul.

1812
03:22:57,820 --> 03:22:59,340
Particularly...

1813
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:02,740
when they take this form.

1814
03:23:04,780 --> 03:23:07,660
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1815
03:23:07,900 --> 03:23:09,780
liberated by the Arab army.

1816
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:13,220
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1817
03:23:13,740 --> 03:23:18,580
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1818
03:23:18,820 --> 03:23:21,740
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1819
03:23:25,220 --> 03:23:27,340
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1820
03:23:28,140 --> 03:23:30,340
You are merely a general.

1821
03:23:32,820 --> 03:23:34,260
I must be a king.

1822
03:23:37,140 --> 03:23:38,940
Excuse me, sir.

1823
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:54,180
Well?

1824
03:23:55,020 --> 03:23:56,380
Well...

1825
03:23:56,780 --> 03:23:59,580
it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1826
03:23:59,780 --> 03:24:01,940
with an Arab flag on it.

1827
03:24:02,140 --> 03:24:03,980
Do you think it was worth it?

1828
03:24:04,180 --> 03:24:06,700
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1829
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:08,180
Yes, sir.

1830
03:24:08,420 --> 03:24:09,980
So you keep saying.

1831
03:24:10,180 --> 03:24:11,740
You, I suspect...

1832
03:24:12,220 --> 03:24:15,940
are chief architect
of this compromise.

1833
03:24:16,380 --> 03:24:19,340
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?

1834
03:24:20,020 --> 03:24:24,100
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1835
03:25:00,580 --> 03:25:03,540
Well, sir. Going home.

1836
03:25:05,780 --> 03:25:07,340
Home, sir.

1837
03:25:14,100 --> 03:25:17,540
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you

1838
03:25:17,780 --> 03:25:20,820
Though it breaks my heart to go

Hello?WOMAN:
May I speak with Ms. Dearing?- Yes, this is Claire Dearing.
- Good morning.I'm calling from
Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's estate.Would you mind holding
for a second?Yes, of c...
of course, I'll hold.âª âª(DOORBELL CHIMES)Ms. Dearing, you're early.Would you like to step in?Thank you.I will inform Mr. Mills
that you've arrived.âª âªMILLS:
John Alfred Hammond,the father of Jurassic Park.But of course, you know that.Hello, Claire.
I'm, uh, I'm Eli Mills.I work for Ben Lockwood.We actually met once,
seven, eight years ago,- and you don't remember...
- Of course I remember.Haven't you run
his foundation since...Since college, yeah.
Y-You remember?- Yes.
- Wow. Cool. He, uh...he wanted someone young
and, uh, idealisticto spend his fortune...
and I used to be both.(LAUGHS)Follow me.Let me give you
a bit of history.This is where it all began.Before the island, Sorna,
Jurassic Park, all of it.Hammond and Lockwood
built a custom labin the subbasement,
extracted the first DNAfrom amber
right beneath our feet.(LAUGHS):
Oh, my goodness.What they did here
was a miracle.I still believe that.So do I, Claire. So do I.And I still believe it matters
what happens to those animals.There is somethingMr. Lockwood would very much
like you to do, Claire.You can call it a favor
for an old friend.We have a piece of land.A sanctuary protected
by natural barriers,fully self-sustaining.A new home where the dinosaurs
will be secure and free.CLAIRE:
You're gonna get them out?You're gonna save them?LOCKWOOD:
No, Ms. Dearing.I'm going to save us.We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?Lovely to see you again.- And you, Mr. Lockwood.
- Hmm.This was all
John Hammond's dream,to let these creatures
live in peace.So we have created sanctuary.No fences, no cages,no tourists...just as Mother Nature intended.John said it best:"These creatures don't need
our protection.They need our absence."When we were young,
we both shared this passion,John and I.What fools we were.Trying to run
before we'd learned to walk.As all young men do, I suppose.But... we learned.Unfortunately, in the end,
it drove us apart.Life teaches us
some very hard lessons,doesn't it, Claire?Yes.- Sir Benjamin.
- Hmm?Ah. My bloody medicines.Will you excuse me, Claire?Of course.Eli here will help you
with the details.We will save them.What a gift...for our children.(SOFTLY):
Thank you.Iris.(LOCKWOOD COUGHS)Does he have children?
I-I thought I saw...- Was there a little girl...
- Uh, he has a grandchild.He's, uh, his daughter died
in a car accident.- That's awful.
- Yeah, I know.But they're very close.
Really close.So what do you need from me?There was a tracking system
in place at your park...radio-frequency ID chips
in each dinosaur.- I remember.
- Right. So if we could accessthat system,
our ability to locateand capture
those animals safelywould increase tenfold.We need your handprint
to access the system.But what I really need,
Claire...is you.Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal,but it's the right thing to do.No one knows this park
as well as you do,and we need that expertise.- How many can you save?
- 11 species, for sure.I mean, more if we can...
but time is against us.I'm afraid there is one animal
in particularthat poses
a real challenge for us.- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name,but Blue is potentiallythe second most intelligent
piece of life on this planet,and she's the last of her kind.
She must be preserved.She can pick up your scent
a mile off...you'll never capture her.Well...we thought you might know
someone who could help.Maybe you could convince him.âª âª(EXHALES)OWEN:

Mr. Eversoll.It's a pleasure
to meet you in personafter all this time.
How are ya?- Excuse me.
- Yeah.- Where are the dinosaurs?
- The dinosaurs are, uh,are en route.Oh, so am I supposed
to sell these ones?Look, you don't need
to worry, okay?They will be here soon.I-I don't really
work with amateurs,so I'm gonna contact my buyers
and call this off.They will be here tomorrow,and your buyers
won't be disappointed.Trust me,
whatever their interest...agricultural,
industrial, sport hunting...we will have something
to suit them.11 species, each with unique
biopharmaceutical properties.I estimate
four million per species.Four million is a slow Tuesday
where I'm from.You're wasting my time.You ever made a hundred million
on a Tuesday?- (LAUGHS)
- Huh?All this is in the past.I want to talk to you
about the future.I'll give you ten minutes.The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaursis to finance
our future operations here.It's, uh, seed money.Call it a-an overture to
something much more ambitious.EVERSOLL: Yeah,
and more lucrative, I guess.Right. We've reactivated
the old facilities,updated the technology,
and importedthe best geneticists
from around the world.This operation has been
many years in the planning.Genetic power is
an uncharted frontier.<i>The potential for growth
is more than you can fathom.</i>This way, please.If the entire run
of our sorry historyhas taught us
one irrevocable lesson,it's that man is
inevitably drawn to warand is willing to use
any means necessary to win it.- You're gonna weaponize them?
- We've been using animalsin combat for centuries.Horses, elephants.The Soviets used
disease-bearing rats- against the Germans at Stalingrad.
- Yes, yes.Our geneticists have createda direct descendant
of Henry Wu's masterpiece,the animal that took down
Jurassic World.<i>Indominus rex.</i>Her DNA,
retrieved from the islandway before its destruction,
forms the architectureof a completely new creature.Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.And thanks
to Owen Grady's research,it follows human command.We call it...the <i>Indoraptor.</i>(DOOR CREAKS QUIETLY)- (WHISPERS): Grandpa?

they're goingto sell the dinosaurs.They're bringing them here.Well...I'm sure you misunderstood.- I know what I heard, Grandpa.

They're not gonna take 'emto a sanctuary,
they're gonna sell them.Not Blue. They need her

<i>How many times</i><i>do you have to
see the evidence?</i><i>How many times
must the point be made?</i>(ROARING)<i>We're causing
our own extinction.</i><i>Too many red lines
have been crossed.</i><i>And our home has,</i><i>in fundamental ways,
been polluted by</i>avarice and political
megalomania.<i>Genetic power has now
been unleashed,</i><i>and of course,
that's gonna be catastrophic.</i><i>This change was inevitable</i><i>from the moment we brought
the first dinosaur</i><i>back from extinction.</i>(ROARS)We convince ourselves
that sudden changeis something that happensoutside the normal order
of things,like a... car crash,or that it's beyond
our control,like a fatal illness.We don't conceive of sudden,<i>radical, irrational change</i><i>as woven into the very fabric
of existence.</i><i>Yet, I can assure you,
it most assuredly is.</i><i>And it's happening now.</i><i>Humans and dinosaurs are now
gonna be forced to coexist.</i>(BELLOWS)<i>These creatures were here
before us.</i><i>And if we're not careful,
they're gonna be here after.</i>(BOTH ROARING)<i>We're gonna have to adjust</i><i>to new threats

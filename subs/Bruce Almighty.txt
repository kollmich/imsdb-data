Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.orgThey've owned this shop
for 30 years, and they are
attempting to set a recordby making
Buffalo's largest cookie,
and you have to wear this.A hair net?
Health department.You're kidding me.
lf you're working
around the cookie,you have to have it on.It's the Iaw.
l just did the hair.
The hair is perfect.AII right. Give it to me.God, why do you hate me?We're rolling. And speed.For three decades,
the Kowolski family bakeryhas been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,known for their
sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski Pierogis,and the occasional
sugar-induced coma
that follows.But today, in honor of
their 30th anniversary,they've invited us
to ride along
as they go for the recordon Buffalo's biggest cookie.Vol. Vol.
You need a tissue
or something?Can we get Vol a tissue
or a spoon?lt's a good thing
we're wearing these today,'cause l wouldn't want
any stray hairsto fall into the booger.Are we gonna do this again?
No. We can cut to B-roll.Moving on ! So tell me, Mama.
Why make
Buffalo's biggest cookie?Well, man
from health departmentsay he find
rat pellet in our pastry,
but l say, "No."ls big chocolate sprinkle.
But he shut store down.So we clean up,
make big cookiefor to bring customers back.Well, l admire your candor.
Let's try that again,
shall we?So tell me, Mama.
Why make
Buffalo's biggest cookie?So the children
of the neighborhood
will be happy?That's right. lt must be
wonderful seeing the smiles
on their little faces.l work in back.
l see no smiles.The previous Buffalo record
was eight feet, seven inches,baked by Gladys Pelsnick.lf this cookie beats Gladys's,
it will prove once and for allthat the Kowolskis
have much more free time.And the cookie is 1 0 feet,
four inches.We have a new record !Cue the cheesy
inspirational music!(CHARIOTS OF FIRE THEME
PLAYlNG)But what are we
really looking at here?ls it just a big cookie,
or does this cookie represent
the pride of Buffalo,its dedicated
and hardworking citizens
the key ingredient,with a few nuts thrown in,and, finally, the love of
our families, which provides
the warm, chewy center,making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.l'm Bruce Nolan,
Eyewitness News.
MAN: And cut it.What do you think?l think it's really good.
lt sucks.lt's a story about a cookie.The Pillsbury Doughboy
will be riveted.Honey, it was funny.
lt made me laugh.There's nothing wrong
with making people laugh.l'll never be an anchorman,
not with this.The job's right there,
but l can't reach it,because every time
they make me do this stuff,l have to act
like a total goof
in order to make it work.l have no credibility.
Not good. Not good.You know what?
Now you're just
sounding silly.Know what? Forget it.lt's not important, right?
lt's not important.Let's watch it one more time.
Oh, no.Just once more. Please?
No. No.Bruce, you promised
you would help
with this album.Now, you get
your goofy butt over here.(WHlMPERlNG)Uh-uh.Okay.Okay. Okay. Now, you just
go through this stack,and you pick
your favorites.Oh, come on.
This is fun. Right?
lsn't this fun?This is nice.Evan's gonna get
that anchor job,
l just know it.Ah, Bruce!
He's the favorite.All right. You know what?
Just forget it.
Let's just forget it.This is just our life.
We can always just have
some kid do it for us.Whoa! Hold the phone!
l like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.How did you get that?
That's supposed to be
in our private stash.You look perky, hon.
lt must've been cold.
All right. Just give it to me.l think l'll put this
on my computerand use it as wallpaper.
No, no, no.Okay. Give it to me. Come on !
No, no, no.All right. Fine.
Do with it what you will.
l don't care.l will do with it
what l will.
Jesus.You know, l might even
send this in to Playboy.l hear their layouts
can be quite tasteful.
Give that to me right now!Jesus.
Right now!Rough stuff!
l'm gonna hurt you. . .(BEEPlNG)Sweetie? Time to get up.(MOANlNG)Good dream. No. No.Well, the Buffalo Sabres lost
again last night at the hands
of the Toronto Maple Leafs.It was a shootout
on the ice for our home...
Of course. They're my team.BRUCE: And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.You know, l think
there might be something
to this cookie line.All the greatest anchors
have had their own
signature sign-off,like Wal-ter Cron-kite.And that's the way it was.
That's the way
the cookie crumbles.And that's the way. . .
l like it. . .Oh, no. Grace, the dog !GRACE: l'm in the shower!No, Sam ! Bad dog !lnside, bad. Outside, good.(GASPlNG)Oh, you're done now. Great.B-E-A-utiful.Come on.
Let's go back inside
and have a shit.What is the deal-io?
We are having a blood drive.Creepy. Needles. Yuck.Well, they need my blood.
l have a very rare blood type.l'm A. B. -positive.
Really?l'm l. B. -positive.l be positive,
they ain't touching me with
no needle. lt's just so. . .Helpful and lifesaving?
No. lt's your blood.
lt's blood.Blood's supposed to
stay inside the body.
That's where it's meant to be.Besides, they stockpile
this stuff
in a warehouse somewhere.lt's all frozen on ice,
and they tell everybody
there's a shortage.That's just not true.
Where did you hear that?From a very reliable
friend of a friend of a girl,whose sister's going out
with someone very high up
in the government.But for your own protection,
l cannot discuss it
at this time.Now, get out
before they see us together.Oh, no.Oh. Here. Hold on a second.
You need these more than l do.What is these?
Prayer beads.The kids made them for me.
They will keep you safe.l hope they're powerful.l'm gonna need
a frigging miracle
to get to work on time.(HORNS BLARlNG)(MAN SCREAMlNG)This isn't happening.
Not now.
Not during sweeps week.Not during sweeps week!(PAGER BEEPlNG)Oh, God.Yeah. Yeah.
Meeting's started without me.This is my luck.
This is my luck!Shit.Oh, come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on !(GRUNTS)Jesus. Get out of there!"R Ewe Blind."
No, but l'm late.ls your child
in dire jeopardy?Find out tonight
after the game.Okay. Promos are approved.Now, let's. . .
Uh, Jack,shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?l mean, this is his last week.Yeah, Jack. Any word on
the open anchor position?Evan, when l know something,
you'll know something.Sorry l'm late. Traffic was. . .Did you guys
already play the spots?
lt's a nice story, Bruce,but we're gonna go
with Evan's piece,sex scandal
in the mayor's office
for sweeps.Oh, yeah. Sweeps.And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.(SNlCKERlNG)l'm just
messing with you, Bruce.See, you just got to
remember that the newsroom
is like a big cookie.(ALL SNlCKERlNG)Do you like jazz, Evan?
Yeah.Let me play something for you.l can hold that note
all day, buddy.
JACK: Knock it off, guys.Bruce, we're gonna
keep your story in reserve.Now, can we get back
to the board,so we'll have something
to put on the air today?Great choice, Jack.
This is the Cadillac
of bolognas.Okay. Thanks.
Jack, can l talk
to you a second?Yeah. Sure, Bruce.
What do you need?
Sweeps.Bruce.
Jack. Jack!
Hear me out here.l'm starting
to get desperate, man.l'm pushing 40,
and what have l got
to show for it?l've hit some kind
of a ceiling here.There's an anti-Bruce barrier
l can't get past.And Evan is loving it,
by the way. Loving it.He gets the stories.
He gets on sweeps. Maybe
l should be more like Evan.You don't wanna be like Evan.
Evan's an asshole.l can be an asshole.
No, Bruce. You can't.You gonna pick that up?
Yeah. l'm sorry.
lt's. . . l'm losing it.lt's just this
whole anchor thing opening up
has got me nuts.JACK: Hi, Susan.Hi, Susan.
Hi, Jack.Look, Bruce.
You're a good reporter.
You make people laugh.All right. l'll tell you what.
Today is the 1 56th anniversary
of the Maid of the Mist.l want you at Niagara Falls
in an hour.Maid of the Mist?
That's always live.But Evan
always does live feeds.Now you and Evan
get the live feeds.l'm going live? During sweeps?
But watch your step, Bruce.l've seen your outtakes.
Jack, you will
not regret this.And l won't forget you
when l go national.
Uh, can you. . .Thanks, pal.Can l have your wish now?
l'm gonna put it in
the wish jar. Thank you.Okay. Put your wish in there.
Me too.Put your wish in there.
Look at that.
Looks like a big wish.Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Martin,
don't. . . Don't eat that.
Don't eat that.Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey.(EXCLAlMlNG)That must've tasted awful.
Mommy!Oh, Zoe-Baboey!
Did you have a good time
with Aunt Crazy today?Yeah? See how nice this is?
Baby on the hip?Oh, it's amazing.
You've become Mom.The transformation
is complete.(TELEPHONE RlNGlNG)Oh.
l'll get it.DEBBIE:
SmaII Wonders Day Care.
Grace?No. lt's Debbie,
the sister whose life
you're not wasting.Oh, all right.
Okay, okay, okay.
Bye, Debbie!Hi. Hi. Sorry. Debbie forgot
to take her meds today.
Where are you?Oh, a little place called
the winner's circle. l'm at
the falls doing a live report.Live? That's great!
Yeah ! lt's happening, hon.l got sweeps, and l'm live.You know what that means?
They're seeing
if l can think on my feet,you know, like, l might
have to do in a live news
anchor situation.Oh, my gosh.Yeah.
lt's what we've always
talked about, Grace.Jack practically came out
and told me.
Practically?Well, he didn't spell it out,
but legally, he can't.But this is exactly
what happened to Susan Ortegajust before
they bumped her up.lt's good. lt's good.
lt's good.Okay. Well, honey,
l just don't. . .l don't want you
to get too ahead of yourself.Bruce?
Oh, l got to go.
They're calling me in.Oh. Okay, honey.
Good luck. l love you.Love, love, love,
love, love.Let's do it.ALLY: They want you
close to the falls.
BRUCE: Really?l'm gonna get soaked.
That's the point.They want you to put this on.Part of the condition of us
getting the exclusive.You know what?
Nothing can bother me today.
Nothing.Okay. Now, remember.
lt's their
1 56th-year anniversary.1 49 capacity.
Right.They cater to tourists,
honeymooners. . .
And people insanely thirsty.l get it.
Okay.And you are gonna
be interviewing
lrene Dansfield.lrene! Pleasure to meet you.
Truly.You look beautiful.
lrene's mother rode on
the maiden voyage.Wow. Rub that in my face,
why don't you?
Ninety seconds!Ninety seconds? Holy hell.
Uh, yeah. Okay. 90 seconds?Because of the fast response,
the toxic chemicals were
cleaned up without incident.Susan?
Bruce Nolan is standing by
at Niagara Falls,but before we go
live to Bruce, we have
an announcement to make.As everyone knows,
after 33 years, our beloved
Pete Fineman is retiring.Pete's shoes are
virtually impossible to fill,
but the show must go on,and we couId think of
no one better than
our very own Evan Baxter.Oh. . . Oh, boy.Congratulations, Evan.
Thanks, Susan.
l'm thrilled and honored.And as you said,no one can replace
the great Pete Fineman,
but l will do my best.l have to say, l am so proud
to be a part of our
local community of Buffalo,and l think, in a lot of ways,
a great city is like
a great recipe, really.You take hardworking citizens,
add some caregivers,
maybe a few nuts,all sprinkled
with the love and support
of our good families.Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.That was amazing.
l meant it.l wish l'd written something.
And now let's go liveto that wacky Bruce Nolan
out at Niagara Falls.Hey! Wacky Bruce!Bruce? Talk, Bruce. Hello?Talk, honey. Talk.
What's going on?We got a Walt Disney.
He's frozen solid.We may not have audio.
Check the feed.We may be having a bit
of technical difficulty.Feed's good, Jack.Move. Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Talk, Bruce, damn it!All right. Get ready
to pull the plug.
Come on, baby.
Say something.Say something.
Bruce, talk.Hi, Susan.
Oh, thank you, God.Bruce NoIan here
aboard the Maid of the Mistin fabulous Niagara Falls,
New York.First off, let me just add
another congratulations
to Evan Backstabber. . .Pardon me. Bastard.
Baxter, rather.lt is good to see
what someone
with talent can do,when great opportunities
are given to them
instead of me.(BRUCE CHUCKLING)Anyway, l'm here
with Katharine Hepburn's mom.
Tell me.Why did you throw the blue
Heart of the Ocean jewelover the railing
of the Titanic?Did you feel bad at all
letting Leo DiCaprio drown,while you were safe,
floating on the door?Could you have taken turns,or were you just too afraid
to freeze your big,
fat ass off?l guess that's how life is,
isn't it?Some people are drenched,
freezing to death on a stupid
boat, with a stupid hat,while others
are in a comfy news studio,
sucking up all the glory.Oh, well. No big deal.
MAN: Oh, boy.Oh, look.
lt's the owner of
the Maid of the Mist.Let's have a talk with him,
shall we?
Come on in here, Bill.That's all right.
No, no, no, no. No, no.Come on. Let's have a talk.Come on. What are you doing?Bill, you've been running
the Maid of the Mist
for 23 years now.Tell me. Why do you think
l didn't get the anchor job?Hey, man.
l don't want problems.
ls it my hair, Bill?Are my teeth
not white enough?Or like the great falls,
is the bedrock of my life
eroding beneath me?Eroding ! Eroding ! Eroding !Cut the feed. Go to black.Go to black.
l'm on it.l'm Bruce Nolan
for Eyewitness News.
Back to you, fuckers!Oh, boy.
Oh, my God.That is perfect.
That is the motivation
that l needed !Right there! Thank you.Thank you, W. K. B. W. !Wimpy Kitty Baby Whiners!That's what that stands for!l'll see you on Channel 5,
where they do the real news.(MEN CHATTERlNG)Do l look blind to you?
Do l look blind to you?Hey.
Let's go, man.
Come on. Let's go.What are you doing over there?
Come on.
Leave the poor guy alone.You okay, man?Yeah, you'd better
keep walking.What? What'd you say, Ã©se?Run, man ! Run !Oh, God !Okay, okay, okay!
l didn't mean it!
l was just kidding !Hey, you forgot your things.Say something to that.
Say something.(GLASS SHATTERlNG)(METAL SQUEAKlNG)B-E-A-utiful.That's what l get. . .That's what l get
for trying to help someone.Oh, don't look at me, Walter.Oh, no!Well, that's my payment,
l guess. That. . .
That is my reward.Just? Just get a clue!GRACE: Thank God
you're all right.BRUCE: God. Yeah.
Let's thank God. Shall we?For his blessings
are raining down upon me.Wait! That's not rain !
Bruce, please
don't do that, honey.You know that
everything happens
for a reason.That l don't need.
That is a clichÃ©.
That is not helpful to me.A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.l have no bird.
l have no bush. God has taken
my bird and my bush.Oh, l see.
So God is picking on you,
is that what you're saying?No. He's ignoring me
completely.He's far too busy
giving Evan
everything he wants.Oh, that's great, Sam,
but you missed your target.
l'm over here!Don't get mad at the dog.
lt's not the dog's fault.No. lt's God's fault.
l gave him
the wrong coordinates.All right. You know what?
Enough. All right?Will you stop being
such a martyr?l am not being a martyr.
l'm a victim.God is a mean kid
sitting on an anthillwith a magnifying glass,
and l'm the ant.He could fix my life
in five minutes
if he wanted to,but he'd rather
burn off my feelers
and watch me squirm !Sweetheart,
l know you're mad.
lt's understandable.What Evan did is slimy
and wrong, but this day
could've been so much worse.l'm just glad you're okay.
Okay? News flash !
l'm not okay.l'm not okay with
a mediocre job! l'm not okay
with a mediocre apartment.l'm not okay
with a mediocre life!So is that what you think
that we have?
A mediocre life?Don't make this about you.
About me?How could l make this
about me? lt's about you !
lt's always about you !Perfect. Perfect.l'll have
the worst day of my lifewith a side order of guilt,
please!(DOOR SLAMMlNG)Oh.Okay, God.
You want me to talk to you?Then talk back.
Tell me what's going on.What should l do?
Give me a signal.Oh, l need
your guidance, Lord.
Please send me a sign.Ah, what's this joker
doing now?Okay. All right.
l'll try it your way.All right.
Lord, l need a miracle.l'm desperate.
l need your help, Lord.Please reach into my life.
Hey!(GRUNTS)What the he. . . l got you !(GROANlNG)Hey!(CHUCKLES ANGRlLY)(GRUNTlNG)Fine! The gloves are off, pal !Come on !

Now, get it straight here.That's the house.
This is the bathroom.

Is Iife unfair?Is there someone

Then do we have
the job for you.We're Iocated at

or we'll just

Thank you again.What the. . .You're looking for Room 7.Yeah. l figured.You want me
to even those up for you?How do l get to Room 7?That'll be on
the seventh floor.
Stairs are right over there.l'd rather take the elevator.
Out of order.l love the stairs though.
They were my second choice.Do you mind giving me a hand
with this floor?What? That's good.Are you serious?Oh, l'm kind of busy.Um, rain check.
l'll hold you to it.l'm free on the seventh
at 7:00.Seventh at 7:00 it is.This looks promising.(METAL CLANKlNG)Hello?
Another "hugantic, ginormic"

for whoever runs this joint.
MAN: Be right with you.l'm trying to fix a light.
Tell me if it's working.Yeah. Seems to be.Kind of bright, though.
Yeah. lt is for most people.Spend their lives in the dark
trying to hide from me.Oh, the elevator's broken,
huh?Yeah,
but l'll get around to it.You install the Clapper?
No, but catchy jingle,
isn't it?Clap on, clap off.
Clap on, clap off the Clapper.Just can't
get it out of my head.Good luck with that.
l'm gonna go now.Okay. But the boss'll be
right out.You must be Bruce.
l've been expecting you.This is hilarious.So you're the boss
and the electrician
and the janitor?Must be
a killer Christmas party.
Don't get drunk, though.One of you might need
a ride home.You always were funny, Bruce,
just like your father.He didn't mind
rolling up his sleeves,
either, son.People underestimate
the benefit
of good old manual labor.There's freedom in it.
Some of the happiest people
in the worldgo home smelling
to high heaven
at the end of the day.All right. What is this?How do you know my father,
and how did you
get my pager number?Oh, l know quite a lot
about you, Bruce,just about everything
there is to know.Everything
you've ever said or done
or thought about doing,right there
in that file cabinet.Wow. A whole drawer
just for me.
Yeah.Mind if l take a look?
lt's your life.This ought to be good.(SCREAMlNG)(BRUCE GASPlNG)Now, this last entry
was a little disturbing."The gloves are off, God.(GROANlNG)
"God has taken my bird
and my bush."God is a mean kid
with a magnifying glass."Smite me, O mighty smiter!"Now, l'm not much
for blaspheming, but
that last one made me laugh.Are you spying on me?Who are you?l'm the one.Creator of the heavens
and the earth,
alpha and omega.Oh, l see where this is going.Bruce, l'm God.Bingo! Yahtzee!
ls that your final answer?Our survey says, "God !"
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing !Well, it was
nice to meet you, God.Thank you
for the Grand Canyon,and good luck
with the apocalypse.Oh, and by the way, you suck!You know what would've been
a little more impressive,
though?lf you hadn't used
the cheesy
file cabinet illusion.Anybody with a brain stem
can tell thatthat drawer is being fed
through the wall
from the other side.All you have to do is
find the crease,
right around here.There is a seam here
or a hollow spot.Where? Through the drywall
and concrete?Okay. That is a good one.
That is a good one.Okay. How many fingers
am l holding up?
Now, Bruce.Thou shalt not
tempt the Lord. . .
Hey, if you can't do it,
man, that's cool.Three. Two. Four.
Nine. Six. Eight. One.Okay.How many now?
Seven.(EXCLAlMlNG)(GASPS)You've been doing
a lot of complaining
about me, Bruce.And quite frankly,
l'm tired of it.
Wait. Don't come near me.When l'm backed into a corner,
l'm like a wild animal.l don't wanna hurt you,
but l will, out of instinct.You haven't won a fight
since grade five,
and that was against a girl.Yeah, but she was huge.
She had been held back.And the sun was in your eyes.
Oh, there you go.ln a way, l brought you here
to offer you a job.Job? What job?
My job.You think
you can do it better,
so here's your chance.When you leave this building,

Rules?Yeah. You left in such a rush,

l'd get your attention.l did the same thing
to Gandhi,
he didn't eat for three weeks.Anyway, here's the deal.You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.There are only two rules.
You can't tell anybody
you're God.Believe me, you don't want
that kind of attention.And you can't mess

Yes, you can !
That's the beauty of it!This is amazing.
Speaking of amazing.
Excuse me.Oh.Holy sh. . . Cow.Since you're through

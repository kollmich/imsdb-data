since this morning.I'm getting tangly.And my afternoon snack was cold. Cold!Oh, boy. Sounds rough. (CLEARS THROAT)And, I can't even remember the last time
that Darling gave me a belly rub.Speaking of bellies,
Darling's tummy is getting really big.I'm pretty sure it's gas, too many treats.
(CHUCKLES) We've all been there.Oh, wow.And Jim Dear, I don't know,
he seems normal but...You know what?
I smell fear on him all the time.- Mm-hmm.

- That your dog barking?Yeah. She's mine.Seen anything else? I'm looking for
a dangerous animal around here.Like a bear?Worse, a stray dog.Grey male, about two-foot four.- Mangy, dirty, dangerous.
- Please, don't.You barking at a stray, Lady?I'm begging you.Fine.Everything seems to be fine.You sure now? He's mangy, and dirty...- And dangerous?
- Dangerous.Yes, right.Actually, you know, we've been having
a bit of a rat problem, recently.A rodent?He's been getting into the yard,
and spoiling our food, things like that.The neighbors too.I don't associate myself with vermin.
They carry disease.Ah, right. Well...Then, um... Then thank you.For...Whatever this was.Commitment.JIM: Okay.(SIGHS)Oh, my!JIM: Hmm.(DISMISSIVELY) Ah.- (DOOR CLOSES)

I'm callin' the cops!I think you can be on your way now.
(CHUCKLES) Thanks for your help.Whoa! You asked for my help.Now look, you may not wanna hear this,
but I know people, okay?And people are not loyal,and the sooner you start looking out
for yourself,and I mean, only yourself, the better.Wow, that is incredibly depressing
and also not true.So, thanks for nothing. Bye.TRUSTY: Lady, you and your friend
better be careful.I smell an intruder afoot.(SIGHS) That's him, Trusty!Leave the police work to me.Oh, no! It's Officer Trusty, help.
Just in the nick of time. (CHUCKLES)- Hey! Don't push it!

but he was just leaving.Weren't you, street dog?Street dog? Oh, I got it.I'll go, but only because
I'm free to leavewhile all of you are stuck
behind your fences.Just remember, when the baby moves in,the dog moves out.I'm stealing this by the way.LADY: Hey, I let you steal that!Replaced by a baby?
(SCOFFS) Makes no sense.- None.
- No way.I mean, can a baby fetch slippers?- Doubtful.
- Don't be daft.Or pick up the paper.- Not a chance.
- Ridiculous.Can a baby provide Jim and Darlingwith the sense of wholeness
and a reason to live?- Uh...

thank you so much.- I just can't believe it. Did you see her?

so this thing doesn't move...Just make it quick....while I work this thing loose.
What is this?- That's my ear, please.

- Two... Three.(BOTH GRUNT)(BOTH SIGH)- (LADY GASPS)
- TRAMP: Oh.(BOTH GRUNTING)(TRAMP EXHALES)- Told you it would work.
- Yep. Well, thanks for your help.- Thank you. I mean, yeah, you're welcome.
- Yeah... Thank you, too.Have fun at home, baby.
I mean, with the baby.What?No, uh... Never mind.Well, this is goodbye, I think.- Yep.
- Bye.TRAMP: Bye.WOMAN: I'm thinking about
getting one for us.MAN: Maybe tomorrow?WOMAN: Yes, why not?(CLEARS THROAT)
You, um... You look lost.I think I am capable of finding
my own way home, thank you very much.Oh, okay.I guess I won't bother telling you
that's the, uh, wrong way.I mean, if you're going home,
that would be the wrong way.No, I know. I just wanted to see
what was over there.- Now, I'm going home.
- Okay.That's also the completely wrong way.(GROANS) Okay, yes, I am lost.So, you just gonna stand there and mock me
or are you gonna help me out?Is that an either or question?
Because ideally...Just point. I'll be on my way, okay?It's that way. Now, listen,
this isn't a backyard.There are rules. Lesson one.
Always look both ways.- Catch up!
- Lesson two.- Cars are heavy and they hurt!
- (HORN BLARES)Don't you know any shortcuts?We're taking the scenic route.I would like to get home eventually.Why do you even want to go home?I told you.- This is just one big misunderstanding.
- Mm-hmm.Jim Dear and Darling must be worried sick
about me by now.Uh-huh. Yeah, no, sure.What is that look?Look, I hate to break it to you,I'm just not seeing
a lot of "lost dog" posters up...You may think that you know people,
but you don't know my people, okay?They would never let me
wind up on the streets.Not on purpose.Okay, fair enough.But you're walking around on the street.
You have no collar.You are off leash.
You smell a tweensy bit like trash.- Rude.
- Which means, to that dog catcher...ELLIOTT: I'm looking for a street dog.- (LADY GASPS)
- Really scruffy face. Unpredictable.You're a street dog, so that's why
we're sticking to the scenic route.Come on. You might even have fun.Floppy ears?- That's the one.
- Yeah, I know that dog.- That dog's a menace.
- Yes.Sleeps in my train yard.- Show me.
- Come on.- (BOAT HORN TOOTS)
- MAN: Go ahead and just stow it all away.Come on! We gotta get across the river.On that?Have you never been on a boat before?I've never seen a boat before.
How are we supposed to get on?Come on, follow me!Here. Just a quick little jump.LADY: No way.Oh, come on, it's easy. I'll show you.(GRUNTS) Ow! Ow!Yeah, it's totally safe.
Careful about the wet spot.- Someone might've spilled something. Ow.
- Yeah. I'm not gonna do that.TRAMP: Come on!
You know how to swim, right?Welcome aboard.WOMAN: How do you do?
TICKET COLLECTOR: Hello, ticket please?WOMAN: Thank you.
TICKET COLLECTOR: Enjoy.Oh, good afternoon, ticket please.
Well, aren't you just lovely?- (WOMAN CHUCKLES)
- And such gorgeous ears.Hmm.Well.- (TOOTING)
- TICKET COLLECTOR: All aboard!(INDISTINCT CHATTER)(BARKING)WOMAN: Goodbye!
MAN: Bye now! Have a nice trip!Not bad. Maybe I was wrong about you.Yeah, maybe next time
you should ask me if I have any ideasbefore you risk your life unnecessarily.Ooh. Was this your way of saying
that you don't want me to die?I didn't say that.- Oh, so now you want me to die?
- (CHUCKLES) And I didn't say that either.- Not buyin' it, kid.
- It's Lady.Oh. Nice to meet ya, Lady.Nice to meet you, too...Oh, I never asked you your name.
What's your name?Oh, I get called a lot of things.You know, I get Buddy or Pooch
or Spot or Butch or Scram- or Hey, get out of the trash.
- (BOTH LAUGH)Who needs a name, you know?
I'm free to be whoever I wanna be.Free to be myself
and free to be by myself.Sky's my roof. Walk wherever I wanna walk.
I walk however I wanna walk.(LADY LAUGHING)You're crazy.You don't know the half of it.- Hey, you wanna hear something great?
- Sure!(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)(LIVELY CHATTER)(CHUCKLING) Wow! They're amazing.Oh, yeah? Well, the singer's even better.
Listen to this.(BAYING)(LAUGHING)- Self-taught, by the way.
- No.I'm not the best technical singer.But sometimes it's not
about pitch or tone.- It's just about...
- Volume?Volume. Volume helps. Obviously.- Sure.
- 'Cause you want people to hear you.- Well, you have that part down.
- (BOTH LAUGH)- That's about all you have down.
- What? How dare you?It's an A for effort, I think...- (BAYING)
- (LAUGHING)TRAMP: See? Being a street dog
isn't so bad at all.- And it comes with a view.
- (LADY LAUGHS)(TRAMP RESUMES BAYING)LADY: Okay, you can stop now.(LADY AND TRAMP LAUGHING)See, there's plenty to do out here
in this big, old world.Yeah. I'll bet there is.Hey. That park is pretty.Ugh, there's a lot of bones
buried in that park.Dogs died?No, that's just where we used to bury
all our bones.LADY: Oh. (LAUGHS)TRAMP: And on your left
is the oldest fire hydrant in the city.- Kind of a landmark around here.
- Why is that?Seriously? It's a fire hydrant.- (GASPS) Oh, right. Gross.
- Dogs, fire hydrant.(BOTH LAUGHING)And just beyond this bridge here
is where I had a run-in with a skunk.LADY: Do you smell that?No, no, no. This was years ago.
I was, like, a puppy. It was...- No, no, no, no. Whoa!
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)What is all this?This? This is, like,
my favorite part of town.It's Restaurant Row.LADY: Restaurant Row?TRAMP: Yeah, they got French scraps,
Chinese scraps, meat and potato scraps.- They got it all.
- And they just give it to you?No, not just anyone. But to me, yes.(CHUCKLES) Okay.
Well, let's give it a try.Don't we have to get you home?Oh.Yeah. Home.You okay?I, uh...What's wrong?I'm not so sure
I still have a home to get back to.Oh.Hey, I'm... I'm sure it'll be okay.No, you were right.Baby moves in and the dog moves out.It happened just the way
that you said it would.I know you probably think
that's what I wanted to hear, but it...It wasn't.You know what?- Let's get something to eat.
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)And I think I know just the place.TRAMP: Tony's. My favorite place in town.LADY: It smells amazing.
Do we just walk right in?(CHUCKLES) Actually I kinda use my own
private entrance. Follow me.Wait up.Wow, I am so hungry I could eat a shoe.- Ugh. Done it before. Overrated.
- (LADY CHUCKLES)Okay, you stay hidden. Dinner's on me.(BARKS)Oh. Hey, Butch. I'm sorry, my friend.
Bad timing.It's a full house in there, you know?Whoa.- Who is this?
- (GRUNTS)- <i>Hola, mi amor. Buenas noches.</i>
- (WHIMPERS)Oh, wow. Okay, let me see
what I can do for you, okay?TONY: Joe? We got tables waiting.Yes. Sorry, boss.- (STUTTERS) We're dying in there.
- I know, I know! You think I don't know?- Huh?
- (BARKING)Are you kidding me?Mmm. (KISSES LOUDLY)Why didn't you say so?(GRUNTS) She's way too good
for you, Butch.(LAUGHS)She's a Cockerel Spanish girl, huh?(TONY LAUGHS)- Joe?
- Yes?- Joe, listen, I...
- Uh, way ahead of you.Bones! What's the matter with you?Tonight, Butch gets the best in the house.JOE: I love it, best in the house.Come on, we can do this. Go on.
One moment, please.What's happening?You're asking me?TONY: Come on!
JOE: Okay.Hurry up, hurry up.What do I do... What do I...TONY: Get a candle. Bread sticks.
JOE: Uh-huh.I got it.All right.- Can you light the candle?
- Yes.Light the candle.I'm-a going. I only have-a two hands.The best table in the house.
And now, your table is ready.- (LADY GRUNTS)
- Take it from me,- you'll want Tony's <i>speciale.</i>
- (TRAMP GRUNTS)Joe, Butch says
he wants two spaghetti special.(BARKS)And heavy on the meatballs.Are you silly, Tony?
Dogs don't talk. Yeah?Well, he's talkin' to me.- Wow.
- Eh? Eh?- Two specials coming right up.
- Hurry.I'm so sorry. Yeah I'm going.Street life, huh?Oh, yeah.
You know, I won't even eat unlessI have a table, and a table cloth,
and a candle, and a menu.- (LAUGHING)
- This is because you're here.TONY: Come on. Come on.For our boy, Butch,
and his nice new lady friend.Huh?- Yes.
- Come on. Come on.- Okay.
- Come on.<i>Buon appetito.</i>They told me they were out of the special.God, I thought those two
were gonna sit down and join us.Ah, don't worry. They won't bother us...- (FOOTSTEPS)

just great.I sleep over there in the train yardso, you know, sometimes I come up here
just for the view.'Course you see more in the daylight but,
you know,there's something about the night,
outside, under the stars.I've seen them from the yard before,
but this is... This is something else.(TRAMP HOWLING)(LADY CHUCKLES)Now you try.I don't know if I can.Of course you can.I've never howled before.What?What?Okay, look, you just
gotta reach down deep,and you gotta find
that inner wolf inside you.Go ahead.Okay, give me a minute.
It might be buried deep.(GRUNTING SOFTLY)(BAYS)That was... That was great.That was great. Was that a real attempt,
or were you just kinda warming up?Uh, hey!
Come on, I've never done this before.Not coming to me as naturally
as rabies did.- (CHUCKLES)
- Let me try again.(BAYS)(HOWLS)There you go! Did that feel good?- That felt pretty good.
- Yeah.I think we just need to work on your...My volume? Is that what
you were gonna say? (LAUGHS)- Exactly.
- (CHUCKLES)I've never seen the town
from this high up.I wonder if I can see my...My house.Hey. (STUTTERS) It's not so bad.Look at you now. You're up here,
you're howling at the moon!Yesterday, the only experiences you had
were from behind a fence.Yeah, I know! I know.But there was a lot behind that fence.You know?My life was full of love and meaning.I was a part of something special.We were a family.It doesn't matter how much howling I do,
I feel bad about leaving them.You don't have to worry
about leaving them.They already left you. I mean, look,
I know how much it hurts...No, how? How would you know?I just do.Oh.You do know.You did have a home, didn't you?Yeah.I did.<i>I had a home.</i><i>I had a family.</i><i>Oh, I had it all.</i><i>They loved me.</i><i>And I loved them.</i>(GRUNTS)<i>And then one day it all changed.</i>I waited in that spot all day...And all night.I'm so sorry.I...I didn't know.Eh, forget it.Every dog's gotta learn someday, right?
(CHUCKLES)People just don't do loyalty.Not like us dogs.And if I were still with 'em,
I wouldn't have met you.And we wouldn't have had this amazing day.And night. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)Every day could be an adventure.
You and me, no leashes or fences...No loyalty to anyone.- (SHUFFLING)

I had a bath.This is the pound, isn't it?Not used to digs like these,

you're better off alone?Wait. How did you know that?PEG: 'Cause the guy we know...He's a lone wolf!BULL: He's a solo act!(SINGING) <i>He's a tramp

Are you okay?DARLING: Lady, we're so sorry.JIM: I'm so glad to see you.Oh, you must've been terrified!The street's no place for a dog.Don't worry. We're going home.JIM: Let's get you home.DARLING: I'm glad you're okay.Home, sweet home.DARLING: We're not a family without you.Home.DARLING: Oh, look at you.I can't believe
you've been running around town all alone.That's just awful.SARAH: Welcome home.- I tried my best to tidy up.
- (GROWLS)Oh, you found her!Thank goodness she's safe and sound.Wish you hadn't run off like that, Lady.
You upset everyone.DARLING: Oh, that's okay, Lady.What Aunt Sarah meant to say
was she's sorry.And she was just leaving.Tsk. Oh, well you know what?Just so happens that I do have
a very important engagement to attend to.You know, if I were you,
I would think long and hardabout letting that dog get close
to that sweet baby.- I mean, next time we can...
- Oh, there won't be a next time.Excuse me?- How dare you!
- (CATS MEOW)Well...Aunt Sarah does have a point
about letting you get close to the baby.(LADY WHIMPERS)(YIPS)It's all right, Lady. Come on.- Come on, Lady.
- Come on.Lady, this is Lulu.DARLING: She's part
of the family now, too.JIM: Go on.(JIM CHUCKLES)- DARLING: Oh, there you go.

back to normal?Says the dog in a dress.Oh, for goodness sake, watch your drool!
I've already had a bath today.Oh, I really missed you guys.And things with Jim Dear
and Darling are, uh...Well, I'm not
the center of their world anymore,but our world is just bigger.That's all. We have Lulu now.Oh, sounds exhausting.We're just glad you're off the street.
Away from that dirty street dog.Yeah, guess you all were right about him.Although it wasn't all bad.You know, street dogs,
they're just like us.They just aren't lucky enough
to have homes.That's all.Then it's a darn good thing
you made it back to yours, innit?Yeah.I cannot imagine life on the street!Scrappin' about for your next meal,
no fences to make you feel safe.It is the oddest, most bizarre life
I can imagine.(SING-SONGY) Jock! Jacqueline!Who's ready to entertain the court?That's my cue. Hope I break a leg.Yeah, wouldn't that be a shame.Don't push it, Mister. I may be small,
but I am mighty.Good to have you home, Lady.(SIGHING)(WHIMPERING)(HOWLING)(INDISTINCT CHATTER)Look what the cat dragged in.I don't know. This guy, he looks too blue
to be the Tramp.Oh, hey, guys.
Why are you wearing collars?Turns out we're adoptable.There's my two. I hope you're hungry.Here you go.Just a little snack before dinner.What?Save some room. Stay.You believe that? (SNORTS)- The butcher just gives it to him.
- (CHUCKLES)Hey, wait, wait. Hang on.
You two, adopted?Never really took you two for family dogs.In a way, we've always been family dogs.At least to each other.What is the world coming to?
Everybody's living with people!Easy. What're you so upset about?This wouldn't have anything to do with
that girl we met in the pound, would it?What? Who? Lady? But, did you meet her?No. I'm not thinking about her.
I'm doing good. I'm doing really good!Are you sure? 'Cause you seem
like you're doing terrible.No, Bull, you got it all wrong.
He's doin' great.He got what he always wanted,
and was right about everything.Are we looking at the same dog?Yep. He's free to be himself,- and free to be by himself.
- By myself.(GROANS)- I screwed up, didn't I?
- Yep, sure did.What's goin' on, Peg?Doesn't matter. It's...It's too late.Her family came back for her.You mean like she did... for you?Oh, man.I gotta fix it. I don't know if I can,
but I... I gotta try. I have to.- We get it.
- I don't!Just let her know how you feel.- TRAMP: Okay!
- Peggy, fill me in. What just happened?TRAMP: I'm stealing this, okay?No, it's not okay! Thief!(INDISTINCT CHATTER)TRAMP: Hey.(GASPS)(SIGHS) What do you know? It's the Tramp.Brought you somethin'.Here.Picked it out, special.(SCOFFS)Did you steal that one, too?No.It was a gift.A borrowed gift that, um...Okay, yep, I stole it.Uh-huh.Look, um...Back at the train yard...I'm so sorry for, um...I never should've left your side.You said it yourself.Nobody else is loyal,
so why should you be?I should've just believed you.No. You shouldn't have believed me.Whatever I said about that, about,
you know, being free and...That was not true.Because being free without you there,
now it's just...That's just... being alone.Look, um, you know I'm a street dog.
And I don't have much value to anyone...Don't you say that.You have value to me.I missed you.Missed you, too.Sometimes I come outside at night
just to howl at the moon.(CHUCKLES) Well, that...
That doesn't have to end.We could howl again. We can run free.Have more adventures.It's... It's not too late for that.Is it?Sorry... but it is.I belong here... with Jim Dear,
and Darling, and Lulu. We're a family.They depend on me.And I'm loyal to them.Yeah, you're...You're right.You deserve it, Lady.You deserve it, too.You deserve love.I'm just sorry that it can't be with me.(THUNDER RUMBLING)JIM: Lady!

- I'm gonna let her calm down. Come on.ELLIOTT: That's obviously
why she's barking.JIM: (SHUSHING)
There, there. It's all right.DARLING: No, actually I think she's still
upset about her experience at the pound.ELLIOTT: Well, clearly she learned nothing
from her time there.- JIM: Just for a minute, Lady.
- (BARKING)(SIGHS) So strong. She...(LADY BARKING IN DISTANCE)Lady?It's so late.
It's a good thing we heard the door.- We were about to get into bed.

Safety can't wait till morning.(LADY BARKING)TRAMP: Lady?Lady? It's me!Thank goodness! You came back!Are you okay? What's wrong?There's a rat in Lulu's room.
But I can't get out of here.- I'll take care of it.
- You will?Okay. But be careful.
The dog catcher's in there.Don't worry. I got this.Hurry!ELLIOTT: I've been tracking
this street dog for hours.If he isn't here already, he will be.This is the same stray
that you were looking for before?The very one.DARLING: Hmm.
And you still haven't caught him?Is that the back of your property?- DARLING: Uh...
- What... What... Please, come right in.Uh, what's... Hold on.(WHISPERS) What? I'm sorry.And you're sure he's headed this way?
Ow!ELLIOTT: Yes. And for your safety,
I better wait for him.And you'd better make some coffee.DARLING: Jim, you heard the man.JIM: Right away, Darling.ELLIOTT: Coffee without cake
is the devil's work.(THUNDER CONTINUES RUMBLING)(DOOR CREAKING)(GROANS) What is going on up there?ELLIOTT: I'm telling you, I had him...Inches from custody.And keep in mind, this dog is mangy,

This one's a real menace.JIM: Careful.
Uh, are you sure you've got him?ELLIOTT: Don't worry.
He's not going anywhere.This is so strange. I've never seen
this dog before in my life.I don't know how he got inside.Dogs can be dangerous.This is exactly the kinda thing
we try to prevent in my profession.Of course.You know, I must say, I...I didn't take you seriously at first.I get that a lot.But you're safe now.He's off the streets,and we've got strict rules on what happens
to dogs that attack humans.Well, thank you very much for your time.- Good night.
- Good night.- Did you hear all that ruckus?
- Mm-hmm.JOCK: Do you really think he went after
the wee baby?I never trusted him,
but I never thought he'd do that.(LADY BARKING)Lady, I'm so sorry.You were just trying to warn us
about that dog...Oh. Lady! Lady!(BARKS)- Lady?

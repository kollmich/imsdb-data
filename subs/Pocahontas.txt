to give them a proper English greeting.Oh! Gift baskets!And he came so highly recommended.It's perfect, the water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.Hey, there, Percy.- Very well, then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.I've got a crew assembled,
and they're ready to go.About the natives...I'm counting on you to make sure
those filthy heathensdon't disrupt our mission.Well, if they're anything like
the savages I've fought before,it's nothing I can't handle.Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.- See ya, Percy.
- [growling]The men like Smith, don't they?[growling]- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you.Don't think I don't know what those
backstabbers at court say about me.Oh, yes, all that talk
about being a pathetic social climber- who's failed at everything...
- I'm very well aware that this ismy last chance for glory.
But mark my words, Wiggins,when King James sees the gold
these peasants unearth,success will be mine, at last.- [man] Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Two of you up on the yardarm!It's incredible.And it's all ours.

- You're hiding something.I'm not hiding anything.Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise.I won't tell anyone... Pocahontas, look![buzzing]- It's one of them! I'm going to get...
- What are you doing here?- I had to see you again.
- [muffled yelp]- [Kocoum] Pocahontas! Pocahontas!
- [muffled gasp]Please! Don't say anything.Quick! This way!<i>- But...
- Nakoma.</i>- Where is Pocahontas?
- I haven't seen her.Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.Tell her that. She listens to you.[scoffs] Sure she does.[squeaking][munching][John] This place is incredible.And to think we came all this way
just to dig it up for gold.- [Pocahontas] Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.- What's gold?
- You know, it's yellow.It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.Oh! Here, we have lots of it.Gold.No, no! Gold is this.There's nothing like that around here.- No gold?
- Not that I've seen.[chuckling] All this way for nothing.Those boys are in for a big surprise.- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.Will you go home?Well, it's not like I have
much of a home to go back to.I've never really belonged anywhere.You could belong here.[wind singing]What was that?- Did you see something?
- No, no. I just...I didn't see anything. Did I?Look again.âª <i>Let it break upon you</i>âª <i>Like a wave upon the sand </i>âªHello, John Smith.Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.Then you should talk back.Don't be frightened, young man.My bark is worse than my bite.- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?Anything you want.- So...
- Come closer, John Smith.He has a good soul.
And he's handsome, too!- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.Smith! Smith, where are you, mate?- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.If you spot one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.[grunting]- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me! It was the tree.Of course! The tree just felt
like lifting its roots...Let's get out of here.<i>'</i> Run!But what about Smith?He's a big lad,
he can take care of himself!I'm glad you're on our side.There's still some snap
in these old vines.I better get back before
they send the whole camp after me.- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight, right here.Well! I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.I mean, I want to see him again.Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.But, still, something inside
is telling me it's the right thing.Perhaps it's your dream.My dream? Do you think he's the one
the spinning arrow was pointing to?Hmm.The warriors are here.[chattering]Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?<i>- There you are!
- Kocoum!</i>Look at them! Now we have enough
warriors to destroy those white demons!Now that we are joined by our brothers,
we will defeat this enemy.Father, I need to speak with you.Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.We don't have to fight them.
There must be a better way.Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.But maybe we should try talking to them.They do not want to talk.But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?- Pocahontas...
- Wouldn't you?Of course I would,
but it is not that simple.Nothing is simple any more.[twigs snap][whimpering][barking]- [growling]
- [chittering][barking, growling][purring][howling][coyote howls][gasping]Easy, Thomas, it's me.- Oh, John! I could've killed you.
- Not aiming like that, you couldn't.Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.- Smith! There you are.
- We were looking all over for you.Smith! Where have you been?I was out scouting the terrain, sir.Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.We'll need that information
for the battle.- What battle?
- We will eliminate these savages- once and for all.
- No! You can't do that!- Oh, can't I?
- Look. We don't have to fight them.- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.- You what?
- A savage?They're not savages. They can help us.They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.- And look. It's food.
- What is it?It's better than hardtack and gruel,
that's for sure.I like gruel.They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!They want to kill us! All of us!They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything to keep it!- But there is no gold.
- No gold?And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?Yes.Lies. Lies! All of it!
Murderous thieves.There's no room for their kind
in civilized society.But this is their land!This is my land!
I make the laws here.And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indianwithout killing him on sight
will be tried for treason and hanged.- [coyotes howl]
- [panting][Nakoma] Pocahontas!- Nakoma.
- Don't go out there.I lied for you once,
don't ask me to do it again.I have to do this.- He's one of them!
- You don't know him.If you go out there, you'll be turning
your back on your own people.I'm trying to help my people.Pocahontas, please,
you're my best friend.I don't want you to get hurt.- I won't. I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothing.But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been
lying to us since we left London.Listen to you, you bunch of idiots.Those savages didn't
attack us for nothing.They're hiding something.If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight them.<i>- Not me. I'm not risking my neck...
- Either too hot or too cold.</i>I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.[man] Me, too. I'm itching a lot.[gasping]- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.- Yes, sir.
- If you happen to see any Indians......shoot them.And, Thomas,
you've been a slipshod sailorand a poor excuse for a soldier.Don't disappoint me again.<i>- Kocoum.
- What is it?</i>- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?I think she's in trouble.The earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?The warriors are here.<i>- Pocahontas.
- John!</i>Listen to me. My men are planning
to attack your people.You've got to warn them.Maybe it's not too late to stop this.You have to come with me
and talk to my father.Pocahontas, talking
isn't going to do any good.I already tried talking to my men,but everything
about this land has them spooked.[howling, moaning]That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen![yowling, whining]Percy?- [chittering]
- [snarling, barking]- Easy, Percy! Come here!
- Meeko, come back!You see what I mean? Once two sides
want to fight, nothing can stop them.- Come here, both of you!
- It's all right. He's a friend.- Bad! Bad dog! Sit!
- [barking][squeaking][Pocahontas] What are you doing?
Meeko![John] Percy, get back here!- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough![whimpering][whining]It's enough to make your sap boil.Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look!<i>- The ripples.
- What about them?</i>So small at first,
then look how they grow.But someone has to start themThey're not going to listen to us.Young man, sometimes the right path
is not the easiest one.Don't you see?Only when the fighting stops
can you be together.All right. Let's go talk to your father.[purring][squeaking][war whooping][gasping][grunting]Kocoum, no![straining]Kocoum!Leave him alone![grunting, gasping][straining, grunting]Kocoum, stop!Both eyes open.- [blasting]
- [groaning][gasping]<i>-</i> Thomas!
- Is he...You killed him.- I thought that...
- Get away from him!Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...He killed him![man] Get all the wagons...Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!- [war whooping]
- [whimpering][murmuring in Algonquian]- [chittering]
- [whimpering]' [Whining]
- [purring][murmuring, wailing][crowd gasps, weeps]Who did this?Pocahontas was out in the woods.Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked them.Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.- At sunrise, he'll be the first to die!
- But Father!I told you to stay in the village.You disobeyed me.- You have shamed your father!
- I was only trying to help.Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!Take him away!Kocoum was just coming to protect me.Pocahontas...
I sent Kocoum after you.I was worried about you.I thought I was doing the right thing.All this happened because of me.And now I'll never see John Smith again.Come with me.[tribal drums, chanting]Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.Be quick.Pocahontas.<i>- I'm so sorry.
- For what? This?</i>I've gotten out of
worse scrapes than this.Can't think of any right now, but...It would've been better
if we'd never met.- None of this would've happened.
- Pocahontas, look at me.I'd rather die tomorrow than live
a hundred years without knowing you.- Pocahontas.
- I can't leave you.You never will.No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.[Thomas] Help! Somebody help! Help!- Help!
- Easy, lad. What is it?It's Smith! They got him!- Who got him?
- The savages!- Savages?
- They captured him! Dragged him off!- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.[man] How many were there'?[Thomas] I don't know.
At least a dozen.[Ben] Filthy beasts!It's perfect, Wiggins! I couldn't
have planned this better myself.The gold is as good as mine.We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us.Thomas is right!
We've got to do something.And so we shall. I told you
those savages couldn't be trusted.Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!But now I say it's time to
rescue our courageous comrade.At daybreak, we attack![cheering]âª <i>What can you expect

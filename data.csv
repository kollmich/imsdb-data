Out of Africa|1985|60|Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Michael Kitchen|Sydney Pollack|"He even took
the Gramophone on safari.Three rifles...supplies for a month and Mozart.He began our friendship
with a gift.And later...not long before Tsavo...he gave me another.An incredible gift.A glimpse of the world
through God's eye.And I thought...""Yes, I see.This is the way
it was intended.""I've written about
all the others...not because I loved them less...but because
they were clearer, easier.He was waiting for me there.But I've gone ahead of my story.
He'd have hated that.Denys loved to hear
a story told well.You see...I had a farm in Africa...at the foot of the Ngong Hills.But it began before that.It really began in Denmark.And there I knew two brothers.One was my lover,
and one was my friend.- It's too cold for champagne.
- It's too cold for anything but.You said you'd be at Klampenborg.I thought I'd come,
but then I didn't.Was it fun?Tanne?Tanne, come on.It's not as though you loved him.You'd like to be a baroness,
that's all.- He lied to me.
- Of course.Would you be in bed
with him otherwise?My brother's only dull,
but not stupid.Pretend it's Hans.- Where would you go?
- Anywhere.America. Ceylon.
I would even go to Australia.Well, perhaps not Australia.
But I've got to be away from here.I'll give you all I've got.That should get you into town.
God, it was fun.- You could marry me.
- I have to marry a virgin.I can't stand criticism.For the money, I mean.Probably.Bror, listen to me.
I've got no life at all.They wouldn't teach me
anything useful.Now I've failed to marry.
You know the punishment for that.""Miss Dinesen's at home.""You've gone through all your money.
You're off seducing the servant girls.We're a pair, you and I.I mean, at least we're friends.We might be all right.
And if we weren't...at least we'd
have been somewhere.You don't think
you're being too romantic?Am I supposed
to think you're serious?I had a farm in Africa.I had a farm in Africa...at the foot of Ngong Hills.I had a farm in Africa.- Good morning.
- Have you had trouble?Now and then. Have you?No. I'm travelling to Nairobi.Well, you caught
the right train.Get away! Shoo! Shoo!That's all my crystal.
My Limoges.They didn't know
it was Limoges.So you plan to stay, then?I've come out to marry Baron Blixen.
Do you know him?- Bror? Yes.
- We plan to start a dairy.Are you quite famous?
They stopped the train for you.It's rude not to here.A dairy. Isn't it a bit soon
for milk at the door?- Aren't you boarding?
- No, I'm going on.On? To where?Mention the ivory to Berkeley Cole.
Bror knows him.I'm Baroness Blixen!Not yet.Finch Hatton, Denys!Msabu, I am Farah Aden.We can go now.- Where is Baron Blixen?
- He's at Muthaiga.Please, come.Where is Muthaiga?Muthaiga is a club
where British go for drinking.Please.Listen. On the train are my crates
with china and crystal.- Do you know china?
- Yes, msabu.China, it can break.Stay.Excuse me.
I'm looking for Baron Blixen.Rajiv.- Yes. I wondered if you might...
- Memsahibs must not be here.- I'm simply looking...
- Memsahibs must not be here.Where have you been?- Where have you been?
- Arranging things.How was the trip?
You can tell me later.- Would you like to change?
- My luggage is still on the train.Room ""D,"" head of the stairs.
I haven't done anything about a ring.- Do you care?
- Did you think I wouldn't come?I didn't think you'd want to spend
the money. You will love it here.Servants are wonderful.
Shall we get a drink?We've got almost one hour
before the wedding.One hour?- Is it all right?
- I wondered what colour you'd choose.It's ivory.
Oh, my God.- I've got this man's ivory.
- Whose ivory?I'm Sarah, Lady Belfield.
Shall I stand up for you?- Thank you.
- Short or long?Long, please. Give me time
to adjust to it.Settle down, all.By the authority of
His Majesty's government vested in me...I declare that
the Baron Bror Von Blixen...citizen of Sweden, and...- What's your name, my dear?
- Damn it, Henry, I told you her name.Karen Christentze Dinesen.Karen Christentze Dinesen...a female subject
of the King of Denmark...are henceforth united
man and wife.God save this company.
God save the king.Thank you for this.Did you hear about Shuttleworth?
No, I said.""He's living up country,"" he says
""in a tree with a baboon.""""Male or female?""
I said to him.""Female, of course."" he says.""There's nothing queer
about old Shuttleworth.""Sarah, where's
your muddle-headed husband?The governor's at the punch bowl
hoping to avoid you.Would you like to meet the bride,
or did you just come for the whisky?Not for the company,
God knows.Lord Delamere,
may I present Baroness Blixen?Baroness Blixen,
Lord Delamere, such as he is.Baroness.
A Swede, are you?No. Danish, actually.The little country
next to Germany.If it comes to war,
where will Denmark stand?On its own, I hope.
We do have that history.Is there something we can call you
that gets around this ""baroness""?What do they call you?""D,"" if I'm lucky.My stupid name's Felicity,
but I do like your dress.Oh, thank you.That's not much
of a hat, though.It's meant to be stunning.We die of sunstroke here.At least
I'm safe from the mosquitos.The big ones.- Good Lord.
- You nervous?Should I be?You know.Wedding night
and all that.So they're both naked
and not a shrub in sight.Karen, have you met
Vicky Gresham?Hello, Baroness.
I'd curtsy, but I'm drunk.- May I see you, please?
- Excuse me.If you want any friends,
I'd make them here.- There's no one else.
- I want to see my house.You may want to change.It's a two-hour ride.Excuse me.My God,
these people drink.I'm sorry. I was just...- I'm afraid...
- No, it's all right.I'm afraid you've
caught me snooping.It's not my room. It's Denys's.
And Denys won't mind.That's the thing about Denys.Are you Cole?Berkeley Cole.I brought the ivory with me
on the train.Well, thank you.- You taking your quinine?
- Oh, yes.He has got lovely books.- Does he lend them?
- We had a friend...Hopworth, he'd got a book
from Denys and didn't return it.Denys was furious.
I said to Denys...""You wouldn't lose a friend
for the sake of a book.""He said, ""No, but he has,
hasn't he?""- Did you come out through London?
- No, from Rome, actually.I thought you might
have a newspaper.No. Sorry.Oh, nothing in them anyway.I had a friend who I used to take
to the dances at Oxford.They were in June
by the river.She always wore
a new silk dress.I think you're
wearing her perfume.It's very nice,
but it's not the same.We can go now.This is Belknap.- He runs the farm.
- Good evening, ma'am.This is your cook.
Name's Esa.And this is Juma. Houseboy.Come. See your house.When you leave me,
I'm going to marry Berkeley Cole.- A man in trade.
- Is that what he does?He's thick with the Somalis.There's a crowd of them on his land
who think he's a prince.He sells
Finch Hatton's ivory.Belknap is a cheery sort.Had a place of his own.
Went belly up trying to grow flax.- Does he know cattle?
- I didn't buy cattle.We're going to grow
coffee instead.That's not what we planned.You were in Denmark.
I had to decide.We made a decision.We don't know anything
about coffee.- You plant it, it grows.
- We said a dairy. My mother...Your mother doesn't care if it's cows
or coffee as long as it pays.You have to be with a herd
or things go wrong.I didn't come to Africa
to sit with silly cows.Just tell her we changed our minds.Next time you change your mind...you do it with your money.They bought you a title, Baronessa.
They didn't buy me.Fetch some wine
for my lover's brother.I think you're tired.Be careful.Did I tell you
Hans came to say goodbye?Where is Baron Blixen?- He's gone to hunt.
- Did he say when he'd return?He says he can come
before the rain.Is it going to rain today?It can be many days
before the rain, msabu.In Ohio we put up scarecrow
to keep the birds away.Here, you hope there's enough leopard
to keep down the baboon.They'll take your dog too.
But that's Africa.- How much will we plant?
- A thousand acres.- How long will that take?
- That depends on Kinanjui.He's chief of the Kikuyu.
Gotta deal with him to get your help.- When will be our first harvest?
- Well, these are seedlings.It'll be three,
maybe four years.- Four years?
- If they bear at all.No one's ever
tried coffee this high.- What will we live on for four years?
- I'm working to get home.If you haven't got it, be good
if you could tell me right now.We will plant 500.Chief Kinanjui,
I've heard you're wise...Not now, please.And I look forward
to our dealings.Your Kikuyu are good workers...and I look forward
to dealing with them...honestly and fairly.Msabu, this chief
has no British.- Tell him I am Baroness Blixen.
- Chief knows that, msabu.Well, then tell him what I said.What did he say?He says this Kikuyu
can do this work.What else did he...Your leg is very sick.You must come
to the house for medicine.- Does he understand me?
- Yes, msabu.If you don't come, the other boys
will say you are afraid.I, myself, will think
only that you are foolish.This boy must
come to my house for treatment.See that he does.What else did Kinanjui say?He says coffee
must not grow this high.Never mind, msabu.
He's a chief, but he's a Kikuyu.If you put a dam here
to stop the water...then I can make a pond here.- Do you know how...
- This water must go home to Mombasa.It can go home
after we make a pond.Msabu, this water lives at Mombasa.Come, then.I wouldn't run.If you do, she'll think
you're something good to eat.Have you...
Do you have a gun?She won't like
the smell of you.Shoot it.She's had breakfast.Don't...- Please, shoot her.
- No, let's give her a moment.Oh, my God, shoot her!Just how much closer
did you expect to let her come?A bit.She wanted to see if you'd run. That's
how they decide. A lot like people.- She almost had me for lunch!
- It wasn't her fault. She's a lion.- It wasn't mine.
- Doesn't that outfit come with a rifle?It's on my saddle.Better keep it with you.
Your horse isn't much of a shot.For Berkeley.
He's brought you presents.We stopped by your house
and them came looking for you.Good Lord, you're sweet.On the road, actually. We're off
to Magadi to shoot some ivory.Now, at least, I have something good
to offer you.Did you intend to tell Berkeley
what a fool I was?- She had a lion a bit interested.
- A bit?But not enough to bite.It's all right to take a chance...as long as it's you who'll pay.- Wouldn't you say so?
- It's the sort of thing you'd say.- Thank you.
- Not at all. Where's Blix?- Hunting.
- Has he been out long?Yes.You'll need a good chat, then.
Shall we stay to supper, Denys?- Blix will have jackets we could use.
- Do I have anything to say in this?- Not really, but we'll hear you out.
- Then I would like you to stay.Good. Denys.I don't know. Do you sing?Never.Can you tell a story?I happen to be
very good at stories.I believe that.What's happened to the cows, the dairy?We changed our minds.
We'll grow coffee instead.- A bit risky, this high.
- So I've been told.- Didn't seem to bother you.
- I think they just haven't tried.Every time I turn my back,
it wants to go wild again.It will go wild.- Your man...
- Kanuthia.- He's not Kikuyu.
- No.Shall I see
that he's given supper?Don't do anything
for him, thank you, Baroness.It's true of all Somalis. They're
the only tribe that knows horses.They don't drink, charge interest
or chase other men's wives.Got to go to town for that.Did you know that
in all of literature...there's no poem
celebrating the foot.There's lips, eyes, hands, face...hair, breasts...legs, arms,
even the knees.But not one verse
for the poor foot.- Why do you think that is?
- Priorities, I suppose.Did you think
you would make one?Problem is there's nothing
to rhyme it with.- Put.
- It's not a noun.Doesn't matter.
Along he came and he did put...upon my farm his clumsy foot.We should have a story now.When I tell a story
to my nieces at home...one of them always provides
the first sentence.- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.There was a wandering Chinese
named Cheng Huan...living in Limehouse...and a girl named Shirley.Who spoke perfect Chinese...which she learned
from her missionary parents.Cheng Huan lived alone
in a room on Formosa Street...above the Blue Lantern.He sat at his window...and in his poor listening heart...strange echoes
of his home and country...They found them there
the next morning...in their room
above the Blue Lantern...the dead child
and the warlord...with Cheng Huan's love gift
coiled about his neck.Had you been to those places?I have been a mental traveller.- Till now.
- Yes.Was this England?
Excuse me. Denmark?I like my things.When you travelled before
in your mind...did you carry
so much luggage?A mental traveller hasn't the need
to eat or sleep...or entertain.You're right.Anyway, aren't you pleased
that I brought my crystal and china?And your stories, yes.The conquering heroes comeSound the trumpetsBeat the drums- I want you to come often.
- I'd like that very much.- And you must promise it will be soon.
- I promise.Did you save my life,
Finch Hatton?No. The lioness did that.
She walked away.So I'm not indebted, then?Ah, but I am.We pay our
storytellers here.It's lovely.But my stories are free...and your present's
much too dear.Write them down sometime.Take care, Finch Hatton.You wouldn't
rather call me Denys?Baroness.Goodbye.What are you doing?I want you to come home.We never spoke
about children.Did you...Do you?Yes. Is that all right?These Kikuyu want to be sick now.Good Lord.Your leg has got worse.You should go to hospital.This leg may be foolish.It may think
not to go to hospital.This leg will
do as it pleases.But if you will take it
to hospital...I will think
that you are wise.And such a wise man as this,
I would want to work in my house...for wages.How much wages would come
to such a wise man as that?More wages than come
from tending goats.I will speak to this leg.- What about air raids?
- Quiet! One question at a time.The war is in Europe. How do we know
they're going to reach here?German East is only 200 miles south.
General von Lettow is there.I don't want to wait
until he joins us at the bar.- Would we engage them?
- Blix, this is our war.You don't have to be involved,
but thanks.I've got crops coming in.
How long's this thing gonna last?We just have to stay
and go as we must.They won't fight
if we won't fight.We could always arm the Masai
and point them south.Do you want the job of collecting rifles
from the Masai when this is over?What about our women and children?
Should we bring them into town?We will deal with that problem
as it arises.- Will they use native troops?
- I'd assume so, but not Masai.Berkeley, what about your Somalis?They'd make very good scouts. We could
cover the area from here to the border.We could gather information
for when the regulars arrive.What's it about?
Have you any idea?- Not really.
- Then why do you want to get into it?- Well...
- It's got nothing to do with us.They've made agreements
we know nothing about.Victoria and the Kaiser were
relatives, for God's sake.They've divided Africa between them.
Do you know why there's a border?Because she had two mountains,
and he had none.So she gave him Kilimanjaro.It's a silly argument
between two spoiled countries.The sooner it ends, the sooner
we pick up where we left off.It may end...but we're not going to
pick up where we left off.You don't have to go.- You want to go.
- We've got to live here.They have made it plain
they don't want you.- I'll have to show them where we stand.
- I'm not so fond of their empire...I'd have you shot for it.More likely
chewed on than shot.The farm will take care of itself,
and you've got Belknap.The farm will not
take care of itself.That's not the point.I didn't expect
to like you so much.You're not going to go
falling in love, are you?Not with someone
who's always leaving.If you need me,
send a runner to find Delamere.That's where I'll be.That's a fine kiss goodbye.I am better at hello.It's an odd feeling... farewell.There is some envy in it.Men go off to be tested
for courage.If we're tested at all,
it's for patience...for doing without...for how well
we can endure loneliness.But I had always known that.It didn't require a war.I said goodbye to Bror.Denys left without a word...which was quite proper.Hello, the house!Felicity!I thought you might
want some meat.- Is there any word?
- No, nothing new.Not much fighting.
Awful fever, though.I've got time for tea,
I should think.Are you for the Germans?Did they send you out
to ask me this?- We had a row about it in town.
- Because of my bad English.And whose side were you on?Yours.They want to send me home to school.
Mother says I'm growing up wild.- I wanted to ask you about it.
- Me?You've been round and about.Someday, I'd like
to run my own show the way you do.- Is that what I do?
- You don't seem to need us much.Baroness, may I
ask you something?I don't know much about men.I want them to like me,
but I...I want to be let alone too.I'm supposed to want
to be taken, aren't I?I've got this book.But how do you know when to do
what they want you to...and when not to?I suppose you
ought to call me Karen.They need paraffin and tinned food,
enough for 300 men.He wants you to send a white man
with the wagon.- Is he all right?
- Well enough to send the message.And where would my husband
like this wagon sent?He's with Delamere
on the border near Lake Natron.That's confidential,
of course.I will bear that
in mind, Lieutenant.I only meant it wouldn't do
for it to be talk around Nairobi.And we're going to have to move you
into town. We can't protect you here.What do you mean?With the men gone, we're worried about
the native element. We have orders.Women and children into town.That is internment, Lieutenant.Women and children, Baroness.- Is that one category or two?
- You'll want time to gather your things.I'll send an escort
for you Thursday.And I'm a captain, Baroness.I'm not paid
to fight, Mrs Blixen.Where is Lake Natron?It's south, bush country.It's no place
for a white man.We should have crossed
the Sand River today.I may have got us lost.God is great, msabu.- What the devil are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to Delamere.Ridiculous.
We don't send women to war.I'm going.We haven't time for this.
You don't even know where you are.I do now.- You'll just get lost again.
- I'm going on.- Talk to her, will you?
- No.- She could be hurt or worse.
- I imagine she knows that.Right. I tried.Here.Find a spot on the horizon
each morning and steer by it.South, southwest.
About three days.I see.Don't worry about us.
We'll be all right.- What is it?
- Masai.Ismail! My rifle!
Where's my rifle?Get away!Msabu's bleeding.
She does not have this ox.This lion is hungry.He does not have this ox.This wagon is heavy.It doesn't have this ox.God is happy, msabu.He plays with us.Tell Blix his wife's here.I've brought you some things.You've changed your hair.- You needed supplies.
- Send someone, I said.You were lucky to get through.- It was really foolish.
- But I did get through.And it was fun.When are you coming home?Not just yet.You're not going to help
at all with the farm.I could force you.
I could cut you off.I'll just hunt professionally.I might do it anyway.It's not the way
we thought it would be.Is it?But I like it
that you're honest with me.I like you too.Very much.I had a compass from Denys.To steer by, he said.But later it came to me...that we navigated differently.Perhaps he knew, as I did not...that the Earth was made round...so that we would not see
too far down the road.You've got syphilis.That's not possible.Your husband is not ill?Not the last time I saw him.That was three months ago.
He's on the...He's on the border with Delamere.
He would have come home.These cases vary.He may have just a touch.You're very ill.Is he the only possibility?Yes.You'll have to go home
to deal with it.The treatment's difficult,
but they have a thing called salvarsan.Arsenic.And if I'm not cured...then I will be insane, won't I?You ought to go soon.I'll have to see
your husband.I will send for him.These ought to help with the fever
till you get home.And what are my chances?About even, I'm afraid.It's not what I thought would
happen to me now.- What?
- Your letters, msabu.Excuse me.I heard you'd made it.I'd have paid anything
to see their faces.- Would you join us for a drink?
- I can't.How is it that you are home?I brought Berkeley back.- Has he been wounded?
- Fever.More than usual, but he'll be all right
as long as the gin holds out.And you?
How is it with the fighting?We're taking a beating.It's likely to last for a while.- I still have your compass.
- Why don't you keep it?You've earned it.Besides, I don't always
want to know where I'm going.Please don't
let me keep you.- Are you all right?
- Yes. Take good care.- We're behind a story or two.
- Yes. When I get back.Back? From where?When you get back, I meant.- I thought it was malaria.
- Well, it wasn't.You may be all right,
but you have to be seen.And the others,
whoever they are.I hope they've got it.It's my fault. No one else's.I want to go with you.No. Someone has to stay here
and run things.And the factory
must be finished.- Can you do that?
- That's little enough.I'm sorry.Where is memsahib?She can come soon enough.Later that day,
I left for Mombasa...and the voyage home to Denmark.It was a longer journey this time.The war went on.I fought my own war.Arsenic was my ally...against an enemy I never saw.I stayed in the room
where I was born...in Rungstedland...and tried to remember
the colours of Africa.There was only the medicine...and walks with my mother...along a deserted stretch of beach...and this room in my mother's house.Denmark had become
a stranger to me...and I to her.But my mother's house
I came to know again.And knew I would
come back to it...sick or well...sane or mad someday.And so I did...after Tsavo.Almost everyone's
got them now.I am cooking now, memsahib.Yes, I have heard about this.Are you well, Farah Aden?I am well enough, msabu.Then I am well enough also.- What will you do?
- I have been thinking I'll hunt.Safari sort of thing.They say it'll be quite a business
once the war is over.You wouldn't want to teach?I would like these Kikuyu
to have a school.There will be
a fight about that.Are you all well?They say I'm cured.I won't have children.Have you thought about us?Of course.Belknap says the coffee will flower
after the next rains.If it does...you'll have start thinking about
hiring for the harvest...and how you'll get to market.- Where would Berkeley be?
- He must be here.Who won the match?Have you got a story for me?I've been demoted.
I was Denys last time.Would you care
for some champagne?They said you
went home for a while.Yes. Where is Berkeley?It's good to see you.He's still down with fever.
He'll be all right.Who are all these people?Bror says we'll be a colony soon.Yes. They want it settled now.There's a lottery.
Buy a ticket, win a farm in Africa.Did you really think it would
stay the way it was?I thought it might.- Where is Kanuthia?
- He's dead.How are you?
Would you join us for a drink?It's time to find a pillow.- Another night then?
- Yeah.Have a good Christmas.Christmas.So it is.This Chief says
children higher than this...must not learn to read.Tell him all the children
must go to school.No. This is a chief.- You are not a chief.
- That's absurd.It's not good for tall people
to know more than this chief.When these children are tall...then this chief can be dead.Bror, yes. But Denys hired out
to tourists? I can't imagine.He's got no other trade.
Besides, we've got no choice.The government's
put a stop to the ivory.- What will you do?
- I'll concentrate on the farm.Hello, the house!Felicity!
How is it you're home?I'm out. Look.I didn't learn a thing,
but I'm wonderfully clean.I'll come see you.
You save me a dance, Berkeley.What's this nonsense
I hear about a school?I've taken on
a young missionary.He's promised me to do the alphabet
first and save God for later.Wogs can't even
count their goats.- It's none of your business.
- Who the devil are you?I wonder if you'd
dance with me?You are about to apologize.You do stir things up,
Baroness.When they said they liked to read,
how did they put that, exactly?Do they know they'd like Dickens?- You don't think they should learn?
- I think you might have asked them.Did you ask to learn
when you were a child?How can stories
possibly harm them?They have their own stories.
They're just not written down.And what stake to you have
in keeping them ignorant?They're not ignorant.I just don't think they should be
turned into little Englishmen.- You do like to change things.
- For the better, I hope.I want my Kikuyu
to learn to read.""My Kikuyu."" ""My Limoges.""
""My farm.""It's a lot to own.I have paid a price
for everything I own.What is it, exactly,
that's yours?We're not owners here.
We're just passing through.Is life really
so damn simple for you?Perhaps I ask less
of it than you do.- I don't believe that.
- Happy new year!Should auld acquaintance
be forgotAnd never brought to mindShould auld acquaintance
be forgotFor the sake of auld lang syneFor auld lang syne, my dearFor auld lang syneWe'll drink a cup
of kindness hereFor the sake
of auld lang syneWe'll drink a cupGod save...Our gracious kingLong live our noble kingGod save our kingSend him victoriousHappy and gloriousHappy new year, Karen.And for you too.God save the kingSomeone has left
her underclothes in the back.I want you to take
a place in town.Are you sure?Eat.Elephant.Give me work.We've got peace.
Where is the prosperity?Why should prices fall now just
because we're not killing anybody?Well, tea's down just as bad.Do they always have
to whip them so?Look. They finally made
a machine that's really useful.Listen.It's for you.- I can't accept it.
- Why not?Bror's moved to town.That's a private matter,
I imagine.Did you think you
would spend the night?Can't, thanks.
I have to go down to the Mara.I've taken up safari work,
and I've got to find a camp.There's country there
you ought to see.It won't last long now.No. I would be
wasting your time.Why don't you get your things?If you like me at all...don't ask me to do this.What's your word?Shoo?Is that it? Shoo?That's a fine word
you've got there, Baroness.Crank it again, will you?Almost. Crank it again.Again.Once more.Well done. We're off.I don't know
the scientific basis for it...but I know you can see further in the
African night than any other place.And the stars are brighter.It's about the tents.When I'm out with Kanuthia...it used to be
we didn't use them.I remember him.There was something...Masai.He was half Masai.
That's what you remember about him.They're like nobody else.We think we'll tame them...but we won't.If you put them in prison,
they die.- Why?
- Because they live now.They don't think
about the future.They can't grasp the idea
that they'll be let out one day.They think it's permanent.So they die.They're the only ones out here
that don't care about us...and that is what
will finish them.What did the two of you
ever find to talk about?Nothing.So. You knew I would come.It's an early day tomorrow.
Why don't you get some sleep?- And what happens tomorrow?
- I have no idea.- Good night.
- Good night.You would think
they would run off.You didn't.Think of that.Never a man-made sound,
and then Mozart.- Have you clients already?
- In a week.A man from Belgium
and his daughters.His letter said,
""We'd like three of everything.""It'll be an interesting trip.
I'll be gone a month...or an hour and a half.Why are you doing this?I don't know how to sew.Do you know what they're
made of? Cloth.Where will he land?Trick is not to.It must feel amazing.It's how I imagined
America to be.- Have you been to America?
- No, but my father was there.He told me stories about it
when I was a little girl.- Are you still close?
- He died.He killed himself
when I was ten years old.I can fix that, I think.""Laughed loud and long...and all the while
his eyes went to and fro.'Ha ha,' quoth he,
'full plain I see.The devil knows how to row.'- Farewell, farewell...""
- You're skipping verses.I leave out the dull parts.""Farewell, farewell...but this I tell to thee,
thou wedding guest.""Lay your head back.""He prayeth well...who loveth well
both man and bird...and beast.""That's better.Will it be so different,
hunting for hire?Not for the animals.
Well, maybe for the animals.Do you really prefer them
to people?Sometimes.They don't do anything
half-heartedly.Everything's for the first time...Hunting, working, mating.It's only man
that does it badly.It's only man that tires
of going through it.Who says, ""See here.
Now I know how you feel about me...and you know how
I feel about you...and we understand each other,
so let's lie down and get on with it.""Why am I here?Because I wanted you
to see all this.I wanted to show it to you.I thought you'd
understand it.Do you think much
about death?I think about getting old.Be like living with a cranky,
demanding old bastard.Well, you are a cranky,
demanding old bastard.I had syphilis.That's why I went home.I know.I never seem to get anything.German measles once.They say I'll have
a normal life now...but no children.So, the school?So, the school.The farm.
That's what I am now.We'll need meat
for the camp tomorrow.I'll wake you at dawn.Good night.Good night.We might scare up gazelles, but we'll
be going through buffalo country again.They get cocky
when you're on foot.Supper.Good size, but...Lion.Careful, the wind's behind us.Back up.Slowly.If there's a charge,
drop flat...and let me do it.Reload!Dinner in a while?I'm glad you came.To rose-lipped maidens.There was a very young girl
from Denmark...who took passage on a steamer
bound for Suez.There was a storm...off Morocco...and she was washed ashore...onto a beach.Onto a white beach.Onto a beach so,
so white...I'd like to do that.- Will that hurt?
- No.If you say anything now,
I'll believe it.I need to know
how to think about this.Why?Your clear soup,
the new lettuce...chicken, just the breast.I trust this meets
with your approval?- Who is coming?
- Bwana Cole is coming.I will think on Bwana Cole.I've got myself
in real trouble now.- Now you think they should vote?
- No, worse.Get Kamante.He is out of hand entirely.Does this look
like a chicken?Here is not a chicken, memsahib.
Here is a fish.Go away.What do you think?It's quite good, isn't it?Be careful.When the old map makers got to the edge
of the world, they used to write...""Beyond this place
there be dragons.""Is that where I am?He likes to give presents...but not at Christmas.He hasn't even said
when he's coming again.If he's coming again.Would you divorce?Then I would have no one.Men who missed
moose in Alaska...grizzly in America,
tiger in India...are all at sea now,
bound for here.Berkeley is going to farm.You could do that.No, thank you.You ought to look
in on him, though.He didn't look
all that well.Can you stay?For a day or so.- Is that all right?
- No.You don't need
two guns on safari.Then do the town work.Meet the clients,
do outfitting, there's mail.I don't know that
I'd be right for that.You've got to do something.I don't, actually.My water's gone black.We've got to get you to a hospital
and get you some proper care.I'm being cared for properly.It's...some years now.She's fond of me,
I think.Why didn't you tell me?I suppose...I thought...I didn't know you
well enough.There's money left
in the trading account.I'd like my share
to go to Mairiamo.Listen.George Martin had black water fever,
and that was five years now.You might take along
that 12-bore you're so fond of.The trigger seems a bit...Get Karen to try the Rigby.It's a nice-size gun for her.Would you like...Would you like me
to take you home?I am home, I suppose.- ""F.""
- ""F.""- ""G.""
- ""G.""""G"" for girl.Are you packed?Yes.How was town?Crowded.I've been thinking.With all the safari work,
I have little use for the room...at the club.I don't know
that I'd be any good at this...but how would it be if I kept
a few things with you?You would come and go
from my house?If that's all right.When the gods want to punish you,
they answer your prayers.Berkeley's dying.- What?
- Black water fever.Oh, my God.- I'll go to him.
- No, he wouldn't want you there.Why?There's a woman there.
She's Somali.She's been with him
for some time.You never told me this.I didn't know.""...with each one of us now
and forevermore."" Amen.Strange that Denys isn't here.I think he is off with Berkeley.In the days and hours
that Denys was at home...we spoke of nothing ordinary.Not of my troubles
with the farm...my notes due
and my failing crop...or of his, with his work...what he knew was happening
to Africa.Or of anything at all
that was small and real.We lived disconnected...and apart from things.I had been making up stories
while he was away.In the evenings,
he made himself comfortable...spreading cushions like a couch
in front of the fire.And with me sitting cross-legged
like Shahrazade herself...he would listen, clear eyed,
to a long tale...from when it began
until it ended.Where did you get it?Mombasa.Get in.When did you learn to fly?Yesterday.Don't move.I want to move.Don't move.Tanne, may I see you?Well, I'm broke too, you know?I wouldn't ask,
but tips were a bit light.- Are you all right?
- If I get a decent crop.I could shoot him.I've got this terrible urge
to kiss you.He is smarter than I am.It may go well.Good luck, Tanne.You might have asked.I did.She said yes.If I get eaten up some time,
bury me here, will you?Whatever's left.Just there,
at the crest of the hill.When are you leaving?Tomorrow.Doesn't it matter to you
that I'm another man's wife?What matters to me
is that you tried so hard.What time tomorrow?Goodbye again.How many acres under cultivation?- Five hundred.
- The rest of it's wild?- Well, the Kikuyu live there.
- Why don't you move them off?'Cause they live there.We'll take it over
should you default.- We've got another year.
- God is great, msabu.He's charging three percent.This chief says...tall children can come
to school now.Tell Chief Kinanjui
that reading is a valuable thing.His children
will remember him well.This chief says, ""British can read,
and what good has it done them?""Miss Felicity Spurway,
clear round.She's quite something,
that Felicity.Yes, indeed.The next competitor,
Mr John Sutton on Castano.How are you?Getting old, I think.Not you.How is the hunt?I'll make a living.
Where is Denys?Uganda. Some potentate.I thought you might
be wanting a divorce.Has she got money?Of course she's got money.Is this importantI suppose.Well, I'll have to accuse you
of something.Or did you think you would have it
the other way around?Fire away. Whatever.I have surely done it.Thank you, Tanne.How do you manage it...
to keep us friends?We started that way.Well, I'll be happy for you,
if I can.I remember that quite well.When you go away on safari...are you ever with someone else?I'd be with you
if I wanted to be with anyone.- Do you ever get lonely?
- Sometimes.Do you ever wonder
if I am lonely?No, I don't.Do you think about me at all?- Often.
- But not enough to come back.I do come back... all the time.
What is it?Nothing.Bror has asked me for a divorce.
He found someone that he wants to marry.I just thought
we might do that someday.Divorce?How... How would a wedding
change things?I would have someone of my own.You wouldn't.What's wrong with marriage, anyway?Have you ever seen one
you admire?Yes, I have. Many.Belfields, for one.He sent her home
for the rains in 1910.Didn't tell her they were over
till 1913.It's not a joke. People marry.
It's not revolutionary.- There are animals that mate for life.
- Geese.You use the damn animals
for your own argument.You won't let me use them for mine.I'd mate for life.One day at a time.I'd just like someone
to ask me once, that's all.Promise me you'll do that,
if I promise to say no?Just trust you, eh?When you go away...you don't always go
on safari, do you?Just want to be away.It's not meant to hurt you.It does.I'm with you because
I choose to be with you.I don't want to live
someone else's idea of how to live.Don't ask me to do that.I don't want to find out one day that
I'm at the end of someone else's life.I'm willing to pay for mine.
To be lonely sometimes.To die alone, if I have to.
I think that's fair.Not quite.
You want me to pay for it as well.No, you have a choice, and you're
not willing to do the same for me.I won't be closer to you...and I won't love you more
because of a piece of paper.See if you can shore it up.Move away.Let it go.This water lives in Mombasa anyway.I flew as far as Narok.You could see all the ruts
where the lorries had been.The Serengeti was still good.Take a week just getting there.And Samburu is still good.Where's Belknap?
I haven't seen him.He must be in America by now.I let him go.I had to. But you don't want
to hear about the farm, do you?- L... Have you got any buttons?
- What are you doing?- Mending your shirt.
- Don't.Don't do that.You don't have to do that.Maybe I'll try Samburu
day after tomorrow.You just got back.You know,
Felicity asked to come along...and I almost said no
because I thought you wouldn't like it.- There's no reason for her not to come.
- Yes, there is. I wouldn't like it.You want her along?I want things that don't matter
not to matter.- Then tell her no. Do it for me.
- And then? What else would it be?Why is your freedom
more important that mine?It isn't. And I've never interfered
with your freedom.No. I'm not allowed to need you.Or rely on you,
or expect anything from you.I'm free to leave.- But I do need you.
- You don't need me.If I die, will you die?
You don't need me.You're confused. You've mixed up
need with want. You always have.My God. In the world that you would
make, there would be no love at all.Or the best kind.
The kind we wouldn't have to prove.- You'll be living on the moon then.
- Why? Because I won't do it your way?Are we assuming there's one proper way
to do all this?Do you think I care about Felicity?Do you think
I'll be involved with her?- Then there's no reason for this.
- If she's not important...why won't you give it up?I have learned a thing
that you haven't.There are some things worth having...but they come at a price,
and I want to be one of them.I won't allow it.You have no idea the effect
that language has on me.I used to think that there was nothing
that you really wanted...but that's not it, is it?You want to have it all.I'm going to Samburu.
She can come or not.Then you will be living elsewhere.All right.Is that a prince in there?I think that you had better get up,
memsahib.- What?
- I think that you had better get up.I think that God is coming.All gone.- How did it start?
- I think God had a hand in it.He gave me my best crop ever,
and then He remembered.- Insurance?
- That's for pessimists.Where is Denys?Who knows?Doesn't matter.
The baroness is broke, ""D.""It's over.I've got to find some land
before I go, for my Kikuyu.You've trouble enough, Karen.Just a chunk somewhere,
so they can stay all together.We're just out of coffee...but I can give you tea.There is no arable land that size
outside the reserve...and if there were,
we'd not put natives on it.- Since it's theirs.
- It belongs to the crown, Baroness.What you want is quite impossible.Yes, it always is.
Who must I see next?You've run through us all,
I'm afraid.We have a new governor,
haven't we?Sir Joseph?
He hasn't arrived yet.But will soon, I'm told.You do still ask me to things?Captain Jacques Llewllyn.- Your servant, sir.
- Mr Llewllyn.The honourable Hugh Chomondeley,
Lord Delamere.- Your servant, sir.
- Lady Delamere.- How do you do?
- Lady Delamere.- Commissioner.
- Baroness.The Baroness von Blixen.I'm sorry to know
that Kenya will be losing you.- You have heard of my trouble then?
- Yes.I regret it.- And do you know of my problem now?
- Baroness.- This land you want from us.
- Will you help me, Sir Joseph?- Baroness, this really isn't the time.
- That's quite difficult.- Baroness.
- Please, get up.Kenya is a hard country
for women...so there is a chivalry here,
of a sort.You are a powerful man,
and I have no one else to turn to.Let's discuss this
in the proper way.You mustn't be embarrassed.
I've lost everything.- It costs me very little to beg you.
- Wait.Give her a moment, please.This land was theirs, you see.We took it,
and now they have nowhere else to go.I'll look into it.
We'll do the best we can.May I have your word, sir?You have mine.Thank you.I hope you will be happy here.I was.I'm sorry I won't know you.I didn't hear it
until I got to the border.It seems I'll do almost anything
to get your attention.I've nearly got you packed.And my poor family,
I've got them near bankrupt.Now I have to ask them for more money.- Let me help you.
- You would keep me, then?No. I want to be
worth something now.What will you do?After my rummage sale, leave.Friday for Mombasa, and then...the boat to Denmark.Thank you.You must have them ready to leave
before the rains.It is good land, enough for all.But they must not fight about it
or be any trouble to the authorities.Do you understand?
Or they will lose it.You must make them understand
that I will not be here...to speak for them.This land is far?Not too far.How can it be now
with me and yourself?You will have some money.
Enough, I think.I do not speak of money.Do you remember how it was...on safari?In the afternoons I would
send you ahead to look for a camp...and you would wait for me.You can see the fire...and come to this place.Yes.Well, it will be like that.Only this time I will go ahead
and wait for you.It is far,
where you are going?Yes.You must make this fire very big...so I can find you.Take that out to the lawn.Have you had dinner?Yes.Your things...
I packed your things.I thought I would send them
on to the club.Is that all right?This wasn't a very good idea.I think we should have
had it this way all the time.I don't know.I was beginning to like
your things.And I was beginning to like
living without them.You've ruined it for me,
you know.Ruined what?Being alone.Have I?I'd like to come with you
to Mombasa.Can I fly you there?Aren't you going away again?I have some things to do tomorrow
at Tsavo, but I'll be back on Friday.Will that be all right?Of course.I've got this little thing
that I've learned to do lately.When it gets so bad...and I think I can't go on...I try to make it worse.I make myself think about our camp
on the river...and Berkeley...and the first time
that you took me flying.How good it all was.And when I'm certain
that I can't stand it...I go one moment more.And then I know
I can bear anything.Would you like to help me?Yes.Come dance with me then.You were right, you know.The farm never did belong to me.I may have been wrong.I had a farm in Africa.- Friday.
- Yes.Would you like a drink?Please.Denys has been killed.His plane crashed at Tsavo.There was a fire.Can I take you into town, Tanne?Why did they send you?I thought I should.My God, you are brave.""The sun shall not smite thee by day,
nor the moon at night.The Lord shall preserve thee
from all evil.He shall preserve thy soul.The Lord shall preserve thy going out
and thy coming in.From this time forth
and even forevermore.""Amen.""The time you won
your town the race...we chaired you
through the marketplace.Man and boy stood cheering by...as home we brought you,
shoulder high.Smart lad,
to slip betimes away...from fields where glory
does not stay.Early though
the laurel grows...it withers quicker than a rose.Now you will not swell the rout...of lads that wore their honours out.Runners whom renown outran...and the name died...before the man.And round that early laurelled head...will flock to gaze
the strengthless dead...and find unwithered on its curls...a garland...briefer than a girl's.""Now take back the soul
of Denys George Finch Hatton...whom You have shared with us.He brought us joy...and we loved him well.He was not ours.He was not mine.If I know a song of Africa...of the giraffe...and the African new moon
lying on her back...of the ploughs in the fields...and the sweaty faces
of the coffee pickers...does Africa know a song of me?Will the air over the plain quiver...with a colour that I have had on?Or will the children invent a game...in which my name is?Or the full moon throw a shadow...over the gravel of the drive...that was like me?Or will the eagles of the Ngong Hills
look out for me?You cannot come where I am going.There is no cooking
where you are going?You would not like it there.
You must trust me about this.Letters you can send on
to this address in Denmark.When you sell the car, if you would
send the cheque to Hunter and Company...and anything else you don't know
what to do with.Yes, ma'am.Baroness, I've been sent to ask
if we may stand you a drink.- Who is ""we""?
- Well, the members, actually.All right.Whiskey, please.Two whiskys, please.Baroness?Rose-lipped maidens,
light-foot lads.Hear, hear.Thank you.This is very dear to me.It has helped me to find my way.Thank you, msabu.I want to hear you say my name.You are Karen, msabu.The mail has come today...and a friend writes this to me:""The Masai have reported
to the district commissioner at Ngong...that many times at sunrise
and sunset...they have seen lions
on Finch Hatton's grave.A lion and a lioness
have gone there...and stood or lain on the grave
for a long time.After you went away,
the ground around the grave...was levelled out
into a sort of terrace.I suppose that the level place
makes a good site for the lions.From there they have a view
over the plain...and the cattle and game on it.""Denys will like that.I must remember to tell him."

- After him, men!That way!- He came this way. I'm sure of it.
- Come on!Come on, mates! Keep up!Sorry, sir.Today is the day I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible.Man can break
the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.And you're lucky
to be a part of it, Pierre.- It's Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.We will make history.
Or we will die trying.- Die?
- This is very exciting.That's it!
I refuse to be catapulted,electrocuted, or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!I quit!He is a very sick man!The electrocution was not my fault!You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!We're looking for a bank robber.Is there no man brave enough
to be my valet?Oh... Aah!I'm your new valet.Uh... I must commend
the valet serviceon their impeccable foresight.But they know I only
accept French valets.Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!I come from a long line
of French valets.On my father's side.
Very, very French.- But your accent.
- My father French. Never speak.My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.Very well.Will you be willing to risk your life
to challenge the laws of physics?- Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent. Pop this little hat on.- He's got to be in here.
- He's this way!And the throttle in your
right hand controls the speed.- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!Uh-uh-uh...Twenty-five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.We need more speed, man.Waah! Wee-yoo!Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.Forty-seven.Forty-eight.Forty-nine.Eureka! We've done it!Uh...Waaah!I say, I say. Uh, good morning.- I'm looking for a man with...
- Over here!There he is. There's my valet.Sorry! New valet.Whoa!Whoa!- Good morning.
- Good morning.You'll be able to let go any second.The pack will run out of steamin exactly three, two, one.Now.Look out!- That was incredible!
- We've broken the human speed barrier.Good-bye, sir.It's been very nice valeting for you.Let's... do it again soon.Please, wait!With you as my brave valet,
I can test all my inventions.No!Spread out!- Cover that...
- Yes, yes.- I take the job.
- Splendid!I can't wait to present
my results to the Academy.Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.And with this grant to develop
new applications for copper wire,Dr. Ramsey invented this.Needless to say,
the Royal Academy of Sciencedeclared this crackpot
mentally incompetent,and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum.Sir. I have an urgent
announcement for you. Here.Don't just stand there. Read it.Oh. Um...""It is with great distressthat Scotland Yard announcesthat the Bank of England...
has been robbed.""My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!You gave me every assurance that
the Bank of England was impenetrable!Sir, sir, I said, ""lmpregnable.""It's the same thing, you idiot!Please, please, not the quills!Lord Salisbury!Please contact General Fang
and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.To forgo your obligation would
be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.A woman in the Royal Academy?The Jade Buddha was delivered
by us to the Bank of England.- What happens while in British hands...
- Is absolutely your concern.Colonel Kitchner,
chief of Scotland Yard,please inform General Fangwhat other items were stolen
from the bank.Nothing else.Exactly. It seems
your little land disputehas spilled over
onto our noble shore.Until the Jade Buddha
is back in my possession,you and your cause will receive no
British military assistance whatsoever.Kitchner.My agents will retrieve the Jade
Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.This time, do not let it
slip through your fingers.A female general.What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?Cor!- Come away from here.
- Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?My wind-powered pulley systemcirculates the house with fresh air.Kitchen items are to be placed
on the white boat,and the blue is for laundry.But most importantly,
this supplies the housewith a running current of electricity.Electricity.This is my comprehensive
data schedule and list of regulations.It's quite simple. You're never
to divert one iota from my plans.I must live my life
with total efficiency...to maximize my inventing capacity,thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind.Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,
precise gentleman.Thank you. Uh... Sorry.
What was your name? Ahem.Passport. Too.Passepartout.Bottled light.A miracle.Hardly.Just undiscovered science from
an American named Thomas Edison.It turns on with a whistle.Please don't do that.Ah, I see your eye is drawnto what I hope will one day
be my crowning achievement.A giant moth?- It's a flying machine.
- It can fly?Yes.No. But it will... one day.One day it will transport people
through the air.Perhaps over entire oceans.Uh-oh.I'm going to have
to make a rule for this.Dear Father:I will find the fastest way
back to China...to make our village safe once again.Passepartout?Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes.Prepare my urban transport device.Prepare my urban transport device.It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.Clear the way. Clear the way.Mr. Fogg coming through.
Watch out! Watch out!Excuse me. Out of way.- Gangway.
- Fogg's arrived.- Gangway. Ooh!
- Hey!That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon.That will be all.Gentlemen.Today I have proved that mancan break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrierwithout disrupting
his internal organs.Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?What am I thinking? What a fool.That would mean that you
were a real scientist!By your definition,
a real scientist's objectivewould be to prevent man from progress.We live in a golden age, Fogg.Everything worth discovering
has been discovered.Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insiston a past filled with dinosaurs...and evolution.And on a future filledwith motorized vehicles,radio waves,and flying machines!Confound it! The bloody
Bank of England is a madhouse!Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.
An Asian chap.Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.Nothing.Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,
and he acted alone.No. Actually,
they say he was Norwegian.In fact, though, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians.I heard it from a very reliable sourcethat it was a gang
of redheaded elderly Norwegianswith very tiny feet.It's about time
someone robbed that bank.Like this very institution,the Bank of England is outdated.As usual, your contempt
for tradition is appalling.You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer,but, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.So now you're an expert
on the bank thief as well.Give us the benefit
of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.Twenty-six minutes ago,
a ship left Dover for Paris.From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express,where he transfers to a steamer,
from Istanbul to India.In little over a month,
that man could be in China.If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,
he will have circled the globeand returned to England in a fortnight.Actually, by my calculations, it would
be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.Outstanding idea.Well, then, Fogg,let's see you circumnavigate the worldin 80 days.I... That would be
a fruitless use of my time.I'm on the verge of numerous...countless... scientific breakthroughs.You coward. Admit it.
It cannot be done.It can! I could do it.A wager.£10,000.Unlike you and your colleagues,
money does not inspire me.I believe every man has his price.Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.There must be something I could offer
that would be worthy of your time.There is. Your position as head
of the Royal Academy.I could lead Britain
and the rest of the worldinto a new age of progress
and discovery.- Fair enough.
- What?I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vowto surrender my position as minister
of science to Phileas Fogg...- No!
- No! No!if he can circumnavigate
the globe...in no more than 80 days.But if he cannot,he must never set foot
in this academy again,he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore
he calls a laboratory,and he must swear...never to invent again.Just as I always suspected, Fogg.You promise so much, yet you deliver...oh, nothing.- I'll take your wager.
- What did you say?I'll take your wager!He did it.Then it's done.A man who has never set foot
out of England circling the globe.This is going to be rather amusing.History won't remember your amusement,
but it will be hard-pressed to forgetthe moment I'm standing on the very top
step of the Royal Academy of Science.By the strike of noon,after I, Phileas Fogg,
have traveled around the worldin 80 days!Oh, dear.Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!- Uh...
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?Huh?Uh, Passepartout.Would you... sit with me a moment?Yes, sir.I risked everything,
my entire life's work.For something you believe in.Nothing could make
more sense than that, sir.You are honorable, Passepartout.But I'm afraid this was
a calamitous lapse of judgment.- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.This house and my inventions
are all I have.And a brave French valet that will help
you make it around the world in 80 days.- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.Yes. Yes. Yes!You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India.We're with you, sir!Good luck!Halt!- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain
you and your valet until further notice.This here doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code.Vehicle code?Code 431.All vehicles
must be powered by horses.Or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like,excluding giraffes and...You're driveling. Stand aside.I'm about to embark upon
a journey around the world.Not in this monstrosity,
you're not. No!- Mm-mm.
- That's hot.It's... Ow!Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.Stealing a police vehicle is not
an acceptable way to begin our journey.- Not stealing. Borrowing.
- Excuse us.We're borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris,if someone could inform
the appropriate authorities.Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.What's the point of hiring
a corrupt police officerif he can't abuse the law properly?- Kitchner.
- Sir!Tell Fix to pack his bags.- He's going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.Hmm. Smart man.Passepartout, tell this
impudent fellow we mustleave within six and a half hours, or we
miss our connection in Constantinople.Yes, sir. Please.
We are in a great hurry.- Passepartout?
- Yes?In French.Sacre bleu, la champignon,chateau, bien, françoise, voilà,
ooh-la-la, foie de gras.- What did he say?
- Uh...He say...- What?
- He says not to worry.The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.Passepartout, this is
a scientific expedition, not a holiday!I will not miss this train.Ah!- Very amazing.
- What?What does it say?Eddie Thomason will be
showing his inventions.Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?What a chance for you
to meet another great inventor.I would quite like to tell him
about my whistle modification.Good idea.See? Exposition. Science.I assure you these are not
the works of Thomas Edison.Uh, I think he is
somewhere around here.Wait a moment. This isn't science.This is art.- Yeah.
- Hmm.That painting is highly inaccurate.It's not supposed
to be accurate.The artist views reality
through imaginationrather than simply recording it.It is called ""lmpressionism.""Well, um, I'm not impressed.Trees are not violet,
grass is not charcoal,and a man cannot...fly.You feel something.You dream of flying.Or of naked men.- Sometimes.
- Ah.The flying. N-N-Not the men.I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot
better than these amateurs.What did he say?Oh, no.Non.Goodness. What was that all about?Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.Champagne for everyone!I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.Have you considered
a career in schematic drawing?No. It would be far too limiting.At least your work
shows genuine promise.Thank you. Those I painted
many months ago.I was lacking inspiration.I found some men
to help me find Mr. ""Edimon.""- This way.
- Thank you. Thank you.He's very eager.Get him!Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it's terrible, no?No, no, it's...- clever.
- Oh.Hmm. Yes.- He's a clown.
- Mm-hmm.And yet...he's incredibly angry.The irony is, uh, terrifying.- Is that good?
- Is it?Ah, this is interesting.Without opposable thumbs,
a dog could never play poker.Yes, they can.Where have you seen
a dog playing poker?Right there.Perhaps I'm not the best judge.Bandits! They come to take away
all the paintings!- Quickly! Come this way!
- Passepartout!Go, go, go!Thank you, Miss La Roche.
You may just have saved our trip.- There you are.
- I would, uh...- I would like to repay you.
- Take me with you.- What?
- I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.They think of me only
as a coat-check girl!- Why?
- Because I am the coat-check girl.- Ah.
- Look.The leading art critic in Paris.Look what he wrote
about one of my paintings.- I can't read this. It's French.
- I wish I couldn't.Why do you carry it?When I do succeed,
I can throw it in his face, but for now,I need a world journey to inspire me.I'm inspired to get us
back on schedule.Let's see. Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots,factoring in air density...Outstanding!Passepartout, onward! Ah.There we go. Passepartout,
tell him to keep the change.Uh...
fromage, por favor.We are going around
the world in 80 days!The balloon cannot
support all this weight!Your hot air should compensate, no?Get off!- What are they doing?
- They're being disorderly.Hey! Let go! Let go!Hey! Passepartout!
My valise! It has all my money in it.Hey, lady, lady, lady! It's my bag.No, that is my bag.No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!- No!
- You crazy.Yes.That tickles!You took my bag.Mr. Fogg!- Good catch!
- Thank you.Ooh!Those are the gallery bandits.Oh, yes!Ah.He stole my purse!
This devil stole my purse!My bag! He took my... Ah!- We've stolen that old lady's purse.
- Huh. Here.We must help Passepartout.
How do I make this go lower?What are you doing?
Decrease the overall weight...- That's not going to work.
- Yes, it is.Physics, no?Yes.Ahhh...Ooh! Ay! Owww.Bonjour.Bonjour.- Eh?
- Bye-bye!Wake up, lady! Wake up, lady!Wake up! Lady, wake up!- Bye, mama.
- Merci.Bye, baby.Ohh...Very impressive. I'd have let go by now.The statue's grabbing his trousers.I don't think it's doing it on purpose.Oh, dear.Help!Well done, Passepartout.We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves.Yes, yes. Thank you.Those art thieves
seemed to recognize you.- I look like someone they know.
- Some other Frenchman, perhaps?- So, where can we drop you off?
- We're not stopping.Once we land to board
the Orient Express, you are free to go.Thank you so much.- For what?
- I'm free to go with you.I did not say you were free to come.- I said you were free to go.
- Where?- Anywhere.
- Thank you. I will go with you.- No, you will not, Miss La Roche.
- Monique.Miss... Monique!There! Now we are getting along.Comme c'est beau.C'est magnifique.Toutes ces couleurs.Look at the sunrise.
There is only one word for it.- ""Magical.""
- Miss La Roche!I refuse to allow you
to continue traveling with us.I'm not traveling with you.
I'm making my own way.Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.This is what happens
when you leave your home.You meet... people!Why are you keeping up this ruse?Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,
and together he and I can speculate.A very sacred object
was stolen from my village.I have taken it back.Incroyable.For many centuries, the Jade Buddha
has protected my people.It has never left our village until now.And those art thieves. Who are they?The Black Scorpions.
They work for an evil warlord. Fang.She wants the Buddha
so she can take over my village.I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.Perhaps, then,
we can help one another.I will keep your secret,
and you convince Mr. Foggto allow me to travel
the world with you.Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!Merely pointing out if they coordinated
their coal-shoveling technique,they could maximize our speed.When we reach Constantinople, I suggest
you board a train we are not on.- Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.
- And why is that?Uh, we just discovered that we are
related from the same family.I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side. French.Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train
go faster, I can come with you, oui?Yes.I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.If there's anything else you would like,
just let us know, Miss La Roche.Ah! Voilà.Champagne with your first-class seats,
Mademoiselle La Roche.Merci.- Champagne?
- No, thank you.- Merci.
- Monsieur.A tea?Okay.How to make English tea.Precisely 96 degrees.Ooh.Excuse me, sir.- Fogg's valet!- A jade Buddha!
- This is not a jade Buddha.- Oh, yes, it is!
- You're right. But I'm not a valet.Oh. Really?Owww!Me bloody nose!Let me in!
You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.Ow! Oh! Ow!Ahhh!You're under arrest!Ah! Ooh! Ow!Sorry!Why the devil are we stopping?Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Foggand his traveling companions
at his banquet.How very flattering.But please inform Prince ""Happy""
that we are on a very tight schedule.Prince Hapi demands it.Then Prince Hapi
will have to get accustomedto not getting everything he wants.It is magnificent.Mr. Fogg, his house
is even bigger than yours.His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.Yes, it is.Not good.
Very old. Look. Broken.And where is His Highness?Oh. The prince is also
a talented musician.If I did nothing
but lounge about the palace,I'd learn to pluck a few notes.Let's make this brief.
I'll pose for photographs,wearing a turban,
holding an atlas...Mademoiselle.How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?Is that what you call itwhen one stops a train
and kidnaps its passengers?Phileas Fogg.Please forgive me,but I feel like Aphrodite herself
descended to Earth.What is a ravishing
woman like you...- I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.- Yes. Well, I mean...
- No!Don't touch it!- That is my most treasured possession.
- I was only pointing. I was just...Don't even point.Rodin.Yes. A Rodin.Oh.I have never seen a more beautiful...
muscular form.Well, I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!Yes.""Hapi Birthday.
Your pal, Rodin.""- Come, my dear. Let us dine.
- Yes.Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.We will join you, actually.
But just one drink.After the duke and the duchess
sat down in the bath,I realized I forgot
to put on my bathing suit.I'm such a fool.Always embarrassing myself
in front of visiting dignitaries.But you know how that can be,
right, Phil?Uh, yes.Uh, it's Phileas, actually.So, Foggy, tell me.
I heard you're an inventor.Well, I try to apply myself
to thinking of new waysto help better mankind,
if that's what you mean.Well, I'm not an inventor,but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry landso that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.Oh.Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.Not now, Passepartout.Oh.Mmm.- Miss La Roche.
- Hmm?It is mesmerizing,
the way your face illuminates.Oh...Her discoloration could be
an allergic reactionor a mild form of hives.Although I've noticed a certainluminescent glow about her
complexion when she's drawing.And sometimes, when she's...
concentrating on her latest work,her ears will actually flutter.- It's rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.Shouldn't we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.Thank you for your hospitality.It's been absolutely fascinating,
but I'm afraid we must push on.Yes.Very well.
The gentlemen are free to go.But Miss La Roche...
stays here with me.- To be my wife.
- Hmm?Yes. Wife number seven.- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!Prince Hapi has spoken!Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we're leaving.I can tell when we're not wanted.Monsieur Fogg!Do Tuesdays work for you?- Good-bye.
- Thank you!No!Halt!Or Hapi gets smashed!Please! Anything but my statue of me!Miss La Roche,
please join us, if you will.- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!- Now!
- Let's go. Come on.Now, take off your clothes
and throw them... Uh...I assure you the statue is not
armed... harmed in any way.Get them!His arm!Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.This is exactly why
I should never have let you come along.Kill them!I want my arm!No!Sir! I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix.- A-ha!
- According to him,the bank thief and Fogg's valet
are the same man.Fogg doesn't realize
he's transporting the bank thief!Or does he?
He did leave town in quite a hurry.Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?Indeed, Lord Salisbury.Eh, evading arrest,stealing a police vehicle,sounds rather incriminating to me.One can almost deducethis entire bet was merely a ruseto facilitate his escape.- Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.I shall name a beef-related entrée
after you in your honor! Kitchner!- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yardthat Phileas Fogg is without a doubt
the man who robbed the Bank of England!- Where are they now?
- They're taking a train across India,from Bombay to Calcutta.Thank God we own India!I want their faces
in every police station,army barracks, post office,
railway station and outhouse in India!We're going to stop Fogg
and get my Jade Buddha backby any means necessary!Agra is where we will capture them!Intercept them at Agra!Carry on, Cutter!Move it! Move it! Fall in!And they were
the greatest kung fu boxers.Ten Tigers of Canton.Brothers in arms.They fought to keep order
and justice in China.The most famous of Ten Tigers
is Wong Fei Hung.Armed with
only bamboo sticks...It's salivating on... please.Is this your goat?Did they really fight like tigers?Each Tiger have their own
animal fighting style.Like tiger.Snake. Snake head, snake tail,
snake mouth, snake tongue!Where are my calculations?Monkey!The goat! Passepartout, I'm being
attacked by a ferocious animal!- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me.And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.How could a man learn to defend himself
by watching animals behave like...- animals?
- It is famous legend.- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.Yes.But all truths are born from facts.Solid, tangible facts
that can be calculatedand written down on paper.And then eaten by a goat.Mr. Feelsillious,
when I tell the storyof the man who circled
the entire world in 80 days,would that not be a legend?Only if the man's name
was Feelsillious Frog.- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way! Come on!Look sharp, now. Get 'em!Find these men!Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England.Preposterous. This is a desperate
attempt by Lord Kelvinto impede my journey.I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.Except bullets.Listen up!
Have you seen these men?Come on!Any word on the bank thieves, sir?They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.They won't get past us, sir!Ladies, have you seen these two men?Look closely. They're very dangerous.They're everywhere!
This is not going to work!- Just act like ladies.
- Not a problem.Hello. Hello! Ah.- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!No, but I am.Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?What nice hand,
nice eye, nice hair...Hang about!Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.Stop, stop.Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.Passepartout, we did it.Hey, wrong way.Ah!Phileas? No! No!Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!Ah! Ah!Ahhh!Fogg's valet! Heh!- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!Hand over the Jade Buddha!Oh!You're under arrest! Whoa!
Watch me plums! Ooh!Now you get him very mad! Let's go.Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!Run!- Which way?
- Down!Again!Down!Jump!- Go, go, go!
- What's upsetting him?- He wants the Jade Buddha!
- Then give it to him!- Phileas, wake up!
- Please, please. You must go.- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!Ow! Ay!Phileas, help!Leave her alone! I'll protect you!Ah!I'm here, my dear.Uh, that stumble was
simply to buy me time.This cane is not as it appears.If I depress this button, it would
deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.This... is...a strange knife.Isn't it a sextant?Yes.Huh.- Are you all right, my dear?
- Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!You men, come with me!You'd better put this on.Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often.Oh.We should run.- What, now?
- Mm-hmm.Yes, we should run.- Break down the door!
- Okay.No, not me brains!- Give me the Jade ""Bu-ddha""!
- Okay, okay.What's ""Bu-ddha""?Get ready to jump! Now!It is him, the Englishman
who robbed the Bank of England!He's escaping in that palkee-garry!Hey, there he is!They'll check all trains heading east.If we could make it to the coast, we
can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.- They're both British colonies.
- Does England own everything in Asia?Not China. Not yet.Passepartout?- You look troubled.
- I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.You did what you had to.The fate of your village
is of far greater importancethan any bet Phileas has made.If he loses, all it will
cost him his money and pride.No, Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that.What do you mean?My village!- Your village?
- Uh... I mean,my, what a village!Oh, it's beautiful!We do need to stop and
resupply, but we must be off by morning.- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.Lau Xing.- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.Goodness, that's quite a welcome.
Do these people know him?It must be their custom,
the way they welcome all strangers.- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.Whoo!Lau Xing.Lau Xing.Lau Xing.Ah. Uh...Oh. It's beautiful.You are very talented.Thank you.You need more blue.Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.Sorry?Vile.Absolutely vile.Welcome home, Lau Xing.Your brothers will be proud.The whole notion of
a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,unless you can
harness the power of helium.Or hydrogen, which is far better...Yes, well, couldn't have
put it better myself.As for this Englishman, do you think
such an association is wise?He is the most disciplined man
I have ever met.The crane!The monkey. Very frightening.Snake.And, of course, the eagle.Phileas?Phileas, I made this for you.Oh, yes.
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.What does this say?Stupid.Lau Xing...I've had quite enough.I just... I...Ahhh.I am going to be abominably ill.I... I want to die.Please kill me.""Dear Father:I will find the fastest way to China.""It's strong.Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.- This is your family.
- My name is not Passepartout.It is Lau Xing.- I robbed the Bank of England.
- You robbed the Bank of England?Not for gold or money,
but for the Jade Buddha.It was stolen from our village.Phileas, he had no other choice.
This was his only way to get home.- You knew about this?
- Well...I have nothing but respect
for you, Mr. Fogg.Then respect my deductive reasoning.You have both used me.You to escape to China,and you to travel to further
your impressionistic humbug!Your overtures of... comradeship,of friendship, of...All that was a means to ensure
I would take you along.My entire life,
I got along splendidly by myself.You've been pebbles in my shoe,
slowing me down, endangering my life,risking everything,
all I've ever lived for.And you!You knew that.Don't let him go.
He'll be lost by midnight.Go!More of your relatives, I suppose.You can just forget
about a reference.I beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Fogg.What's he screaming about?He's saying, ""Please, let me go.
I'm bored.""Why is he in prison?Urinating in public.Charming.At least he had the decency
to be forthcoming about it.Is there anything you've told me
that's even remotely true?I really can sing.# Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques# Dormez-vous# Dormez-vous# Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines# Ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding #Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.
Ding, dang, dong.Look!Oh, good. Here comes
Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.- Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off killing me.You have nerve.
Are your comrades so brave?Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your silly bracelet.All right. It's not silly.I spit on you! France spits on you!Vive I'Anjou!- Your turn will come soon enough.
- Coward!Leave them alone. Fight me.Yes, fight him.Let's see how ferocious you really are.Hey, that's cheating!- Look out!
- Huh?Left!Behind you!No!- Hit them!
- Silence!You savages!Phileas, help him!- Watch out on the right.
- Huh?No, my right.Stop helping me!What's happening?Where is Passepartout?How is he getting on?I wouldn't say he's winning,
but, uh, I think he's doing all right.Go home to mama.Huh?- What took you so long?
- I had to finish my lunch.Wong Fei Hung!Surely you're not foolish enough
to take on all of my men by yourself?Ten Tigers?Kill them!Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!What's happening?Phileas!Ohhh!Passepartout... Knife!- Merci.
- You're welcome.You promise me that Black Scorpions
will never come back to Lanzhou.These are my brothers and sister.
The Ten Tigers.- But there are only nine.
- Including me.They're real.The legend was true.- Mr. Fogg...
- Passepartout,or whatever your name is,
save your apologies.Phileas, he risked his life
for what he believes in.If anyone understands that, you do.Please ensure Miss La Roche
finds safe passage home.This should be adequate.Oh.I, uh, believe this is your veil.I will never dress like a woman again.Ever.Mr. Fogg.
Please let me help you win your bet.I have secured the services
of a more reliable gentleman.Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,travel alone.Fifi La Belle!
She sings! She dances!She does the dance of the...
You, sir, come right in.See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...Ah, the most modern city in the world.Finally, civilization.Excuse me. Pardon me.Can anyone direct me
to the Pacific Railroad Station?Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.No, no, no.
Please, it's my fault entirely.- Let me, uh...
- Oh... Ah!Oh. Oh, Lord,
I think I sprained my knee.Uh! Ooh.I should find you a physician.There's a doctor who has
an office around the corner.Excellent.
Well, uh, I'll get him for you.Thank you.There should be more people
like you in this world.Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!Whoo!Mon Dieu.Can you imagine Phileas alone
in a place like this?I'm sure he's fine.Alms.Alms.Alms for the poor?Arms?You already got arms.
It's money you need.I can't even scrounge proficiently.Hey.Cheer up, pal. You just gotta
figure out what'll work for you.Now, what makes you
different from them?I'm hungry and miserable.No. You stink.Your stink is your most powerful weapon
in your begging arsenal.Watch this.Hey.- Give me money.
- Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.- That guy smells like a dead horse!
- I'm not proud of it.Simple, yet effective.- Yeah, I see.
- You try.Give it a shot. I got faith in you.Excuse me. Now, uh, you...Ah.I'm not gonna lie to you.
That's gonna happen about half the time.It's a volume business.- Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes, I would rather...Maybe later.What are them drawings?
You some kind of devil worshipper?Don't you be putting a hex on me.
I'll cut you.- I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.Or, rather, I was.One day I will build a machine
that will allow man to fly.Flying men? Where?- Nowhere.
- Where are the flying men?- Where are the flying men?
- Over there.The bird men are coming! I knew it!The bird men are coming!
The bird men are coming!The birds! The bird men!Bird men! Birds!""I traveled the world for inspirationand found it in a man...
who lives what he dreams.""- Phileas?
- No.Passepartout! Monique!Mr. Fogg.You crossed the Pacific Ocean.
For me?- We will help you win your bet.
- Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.- But why would you do this?
- Because you are our friend,and perhaps... more.More with her. You and me?
We just stick with friends.- Ooh.
- Oof!Lord Kelvin, I can
offer you something much more preciousthan a single Jade Buddha.Beneath Lanzhou are a series
of untapped jade reserves.If the town were to be overrun,
those reserves would be ours.I see.However, should Phileas Fogg
win this race,I will have neither the power nor
the means to hand over any arsenal.Then I will see to it personally
that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.Very well.
Let us consider our deal to be...Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.What's this blocking my jade reserves?
That will have to be demolished.But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.It's not that great.Passepartout went
to get help hours ago.What if he's lost, or...Don't fret, my dear.Passepartout's a warrior
with impeccable survival instincts.No doubt he'll return with help, and we
will board our train with time to spare.Agua.Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.Help!- Help us!
- Help!Ah! A rattlesnake!Help!I don't want to die!Ah. Good morning.- Howdy.
- Hey.Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.How's about going someplace else?
You're blocking the path.Wilbur, it's him.I'll be damned.Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.
This is my brother, Wilbur.- We're big fans of yours.
- Fan's a strong word.Better way to say it's we got a lot
of money riding on you to win your bet.We're gonna use
our winnings to build this.Orville, maybe now is not the time.
Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.Just one second. Forgive my brother.
He's got his head up in the clouds.He's one of these dreamers who thinks
man's gonna go swooshing aroundon the planet
like a little hummingbird.Yeah, we're all gonna fly.
He thinks so, too.It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.
He's kind of a moron.He's mastered the cable steering system.
The drag-and-lift ratio.- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.That's what I've been saying,
but Orville doesn't listen.All that stuff about mastering...
That's what I say.You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.- But you told me...
- You gotta have confidence.- You've got to speak up and support me.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.Have you come across our friend
on your way here?Who are we looking for?Passepartout.You mean the crazy,
half-naked Chinese guywe saw running around,
where he was like...- Singing ""Frère Jacques""?
- With a cow skull on his head?- Possibly.
- Yes.- He's in the back of the wagon.
- Passepartout.- You are alive!
- Is that you, Grandma?- Bye-bye.
- Good luck. Go win the bet.- No pressure, but you gotta win it.
- Bye.Now, you see, to get the real
classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.I did.""I did""? What's with the ""I did""?We're the Wright Brothers.
We did. Now go.Hyah!They're not going to make it!Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!So much to see! So little time!Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!Go, go, go! Go, go, go!- We're never going to make it.
- Phileas Fogg?Autograph this for me?
It's for the wife.Certainly. This business about me
robbing the Bank of England...Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.The boat. Follow me.
I know a shortcut. Make a lane!Make a lane!Where are we?- Ah!
- Whoa!- That's a big man.
- It is a lady. A French lady.She looks like an evil
Chinese warlord to me.Your journey has caused
quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,but I'm afraid it ends here.Leave them alone.
This has nothing to do with them.On the contrary, Lau Xing,Lord Kelvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,they entail his... permanent detour.I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,but to align himself
with such a little scoundrel!You're not a scoundrel,
but you are quite small!As in petite, but most definitely lethal
and generally very scary.One, two...- Go!
- Three!- Go up there.
- Stop them.Passepartout, my cane!Uh, there.Passepartout!
Help! We are trapped!Help!Passepartout! Help!There you are!You have a knife in your buttock.It's the evil Chinese warlord!- Ooh!
- Huh?She's coming!The boat!Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.Wait, wait! What am I thinking?Passepartout can't defeat them.He's nine Tigers short.Phileas, I do believe you are becoming
the man of my dreams.When this is over,
let's hope the arms and legsof the man of your dreams
are still attached to the torso...of the man of your dreams.- You have failed to stop him.
- Then your death will have to suffice.Let go of me!The book! It's going to fall!
How can we save...- Phileas?
- I will save him...Wah!Mr. Fogg!No!Oh. Passepartout?Passepartout!- Huh?
- You're alive!Are you injured?Yes, well, uh...
Rules are made to be broken.Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.
You'll lose your bet.Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.You must be the eleventh Tiger.Meow!- Let's go. We must catch the next ship.
- It would never reach London in time.No. No! No!We are not giving up!
I almost died! You almost died!We take the next ship
and win that bet!Very well.- Let's go.
- Yes!Thank you.Yes. Yes! Yes!Oh, it's hopeless.By those calculations,
I'm still behind by one day.- There must be some way!
- Phileas Fogg on my boat?What an honor, sir!I've quite a penny wagered on you.
The wife's none too happy about it.Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile
since that shark almost devoured me.Got 'em both in one bite.Ah, it's Inspector Fix!My goodness! He made it
around the world before Fogg!I came back from India
the short way, you ninny!I take it you don't have
Phileas Fogg in that valise.A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?That's the last
of the coal, Captain.Mr. Fogg.I'm sorry to say,
we've burnt the last of the coal.But I've had a word with the crew,and all of them...have agreed to burn their shoes.The effort is appreciated, Captain.Unfortunately,
we've gained a mere six hours.- Even shoes cannot help us now.
- Must be something we can do.That's it.
I've got it.Birds.Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!No, we'll fly to London.We follow the laws of physics
mastered by the birds millennia agoand combine it with the Wright
Brothers' steering system.Most people would laugh at you.But not us. We care about you.Captain, I'm afraid
I have to ask permissionto dismantle your ship
to build this machine.Dismantle Carmen?But she's me livelihood,
me most loyal companion.Never, never, ever!What if I could direct you
to an impeccable physicianwho could replace both your nipples,
at my expense,and I will give you enough money
to buy a brand-new ship?You had me at the nipples.- Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!
- Aye, aye, Captain!One, two! One, two!Timber!I'll go sharpen the propeller.Wrong way. Not looking.Just one more.That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!The Greenwich time zone. The last time
I shall set my watch ahead.Well...- Shall we fly?
- Let's.Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!Hurrah!Inspiring words.- Very well. Prepare for takeoff!
- Yes, sir!- Mr. Fogg, are you sure?
- No!Whoa!How the hell are we getting back?Whoa!- Now!
- Ohhh!You did it, Phileas! We are flying!My God! It's...magical!- Better than your dreams?
- Better than my dreams.Hey! Don't forget to steer!It's a...a telegram from...General Fang, sir.We're going to make it!- This all right?
- Oh, dear.- This is exactly like a dream I had.
- You dream of winning the race?- No, of crashing to my death.
- Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.- Look up there!
- Great Scott!Look! A flying machine!- Don't step on the wing!
- It's Phileas Fogg!Sir, rumor has it a flying machine
is heading for the Royal Academy,our bank thief at the pedals.Some people will believe anything.A flying machine is
heading for the Academy!- The bank thief is pedaling!
- See what I mean?Help!Well done, Passepartout!The wing ropes!Just a minor setback.
Another minor setback.All right, this is a major setback.A flying machine is headed
for the Royal Academy,and witnesses swear
that it's Phileas Fogg.Faster, Passepartout! Faster!- We're losing altitude!
- Landing gear?That would have been
an excellent idea!The bird men are here!No. I will not lose this wager!He is not to reach the top step.
Get the police. Here. Now!I want Fogg arrested the moment
his feet touch British soil!Oh!- I'm sorry...
- Right in my ear!Passepartout, get back in your seat.We're going to return to the ground!Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!Why are they fleeing?Cowards!Hold on!Make it to the top step!- New Zealand. We didn't go there.
- Top step.Arrest them!
They robbed the Bank of England!No, no!
Nonsense! Where is your proof?This is the Royal Academy of Science!We don't need to prove anything!Besides which,
by the time you get out of jail,you'll have lost the wager.Noon.We did our best.Out of me way! Move it!
I used to be somebody important!Should have thrown him
through a higher window.- Get off!
- Get rid of this buffoon!That's the thanks I get for going
halfway around the world to stop Fogg?He also sent a Chinese warlord
to kill Phileas Fogg!That's right. He did!Lies! All of it!- Kitchner!
- Yes?- Tell them!
- Oh, well, yes, uh...- Well, the thing of it...
- You mumbling moron!Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!- Rhodes!
- The thing of it is,I don't want to make a fuss.You spineless cretins!That man stuck me with quills!
Bunches of them!Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!It's true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered lord.- No!
- Oh, boo-hoo!So what if I did
try to kill Phileas Fogg?What are you gutless peons
going to do about it?I hold all the power!
I run everything!So which of you half-wits
is going to stop me? You? You? You?- The queen!
- The queen?Oh, the queen!That inbred, antiquated old cow!The only way she could stop me
is if she sat on me!With her big, fat royal bottom!She's behind me, isn't she?Oh, Your Majesty.I have just apprehended the culprits
who robbed the Bank of England.- No, Majesty!
- Rubbish!Quiet!I love being able to do that.So, Lord Kelvin,unsportsmanlike conduct,
attempted murder,trading my arsenal for Buddhas.How do you know about that?
I never said...Admit it. You've been
a naughty boy, haven't you?Your Majesty, I assure you,
there is an explanation for all of this.What it was, was, was...I was... I... I was simply...simply...Why do they always run?Arrest him.Get out of my way, you fools!
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?I'll kill you!
I'll have you for this, Fogg!So, is this Phileas Fogg's
miraculous flying invention?Your Majesty, we all invented it.I'm very impressed,
and that doesn't happen often.Thank you.But still, we failed
to help Phileas win his bet.- I'm sorry, Phileas.
- Don't be, my chéri.I saw the world.
I learnt of new cultures.I flew across an ocean.I wore women's clothing.Oh?Made a friend.Fell in love.- Who cares if I lost a wager?
- I do.- I've got 20 quid riding on you.
- Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.Correct. Which gives you
24 hours remaining.- Could we have miscounted?
- No.I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour
as we passed each time zone.The international date line.We set our watches forward
at 20 more time zones, so...here it's still day 79.- So, we've...
- We've won!We won, we won...Thank God. Ah!Your Majesty, I...
I apologize. Do forgive me.- I quite forgot myself.
- Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.I shall need a new minister of science.Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.- Shall we?
- Yeah.Go!- We won, Phileas! We won!
- Yes!We won!Oh, well done!Go ahead."

The Best 720p/1080p/3d movies with the lowest file size on the internet.(BUS APPROACHING)Hello.My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.Do you want a chocolate?I could eat about
a million and a half of these.My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.You never know what you're gonna get.Those must be comfortable shoes.I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.I wish I had shoes like that.My feet hurt.Mama always said there's an awful lotyou could tell about a person
by their shoes:Where they're going,
where they've been.I've worn lots of shoes.I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.Mama said they'd take me anywhere.She said they was my magic shoes.All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.Let's take a little walk around.How do those feel?His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,as strong as I've ever seen,but his back is as crooked
as a politician.But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?Forrest!FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,General Nathan Bedford Forrest.She said we was related to him
in some way.And what he did was,he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheetsand act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.And anyway, that's how I got my name,Forrest Gump.Mama said that the ""Forrest"" partwas to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,well, just don't make no sense.(CLANG)Okay... Get it, get it...Wait, is it this way? Hold on.All right...What are you all staring at?Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.If God intended
everybody to be the same,he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.FORREST: Mama always had a way of
explaining thingsso I could understand them.We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.That's in the county of Greenbow.Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpahad come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,something like that.Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,Mama decided to let those rooms out,mostly to people passing through,like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.That's how me and Mama got money.Mama was a real smart lady.Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.Did you hear what I said, Forrest?You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.Now, his IQ is 75.Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.FORREST: She wanted me to have
the finest education,so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.I met the principal and all.I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.Now, this is normal.Forrest is right here.The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.He's gonna have to go
to a special school.Now, he'll be just fine.What does ""normal"" mean, anyway?He might be a bit on the slow side,but my boy Forrest is gonna getthe same opportunities
as everyone else.He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.We're talking about
five little points here.There must be something can be done.We're a progressive school system.We don't want to see anybody
left behind.Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?He's on vacation.(GASPING AND PANTING)Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.You don't say much, do you?(GASPING AND PANTING)""Finally, he had to try.""It looked easy, but,""oh, what happened.- ""First, there...""
- Mama, what's ""vacation"" mean?- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.Vacation's when you go somewhereand you don't ever come back.FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.There was always folks
coming and going.MRS. GUMP: Supper.- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.FORREST: Sometimes we had
so many people staying with usthat every room
was filled with travelers.You know, folks living out
of their suitcasesand hat cases and sample cases.Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...One time, a young man
was staying with us,and he had him a guitar case.(SINGING HOUND DOG)Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.ELVIS PRESLEY:
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.Slow it down some.(SINGING HOUND DOG)FORREST: I liked that guitar.It sounded good.I started moving around to the music,swinging my hips.This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,and guess what?(SINGING HOUND DOG)This is not for children's eyes.Some years later,
that handsome young manwho they called ""The King,""well, he'd sung too many songs,had himself a heart attack,
or something.Must be hard being a king.You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.FORREST: I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.Are you coming along?Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.This is the bus to school.I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.This seat's taken.It's taken!You can't sit here.FORREST: You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,'cause I don't remember being born.I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.But I do remember the first time I heardthe sweetest voice in the wide world.JENNY: You can sit here if you want.I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.She was like an angel.Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?What's wrong with your legs?Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.I just sat next to her on that busand had a conversation
all the way to school....my back's crooked like
a question mark.These are going to make me...And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.Are you stupid or something?Mama says, ""Stupid is as stupid does.""- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.From that day on,
we was always together.Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.She taught me how to climb.Come on, Forrest, you can do it.I showed her how to dangle.""...a good little monkey and...""She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.She was my most special friend.My only friend.Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.Some people don't think so, but they do.Hey, dummy!Are you retarded, orjust plain stupid?- ""Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.""
- JENNY: Just run away, Forrest.Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!- Get the bikes!
- BOY 1: Hurry up! Let's get him!- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!We're gonna get you!Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!Come back here, you!Run, Forrest!Run!FORREST: Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,but I can run like the wind blows.From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,I was running!BOY 1: He's getting away! Stop him!That boy sure is a running fool.Now, remember how I told you thatJenny never seemed
to want to go home?Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.Jenny?He was a very loving man.He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?(SHUSHES)Daddy's taking a nap.- MR. CURRAN: Jenny!
- Come on!MR. CURRAN:
Jenny, where'd you run to?You'd better get back here, girl!Where you at?Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?Jenny!Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.MR. CURRAN: Jenny!Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,far, far away from here.Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,far, far away from here.Mama always said
that God is mysterious.Jenny!He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.You'd better get back here!Instead,he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,just 'cause she said she was scared.Scared of what, I don't know,but I think it was her grandma's dog.He was a mean dog.Anyway, Jenny and me was best friendsall the way up through high school.- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,did you hear me, stupid?- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!BOY 1: Get in the truck! Let's move it!Come on, he's getting away! Move it!Run, Forrest! Run!BOY 2: You better be running, stupid!
BOY 1: Come on, dummy!- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!Jack rabbit!(BOYS LAUGHING)Yeah!Go! Go! Go!Run, Forrest!Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,I never thought it would
take me anywhere.(BOYS WHOOPING)- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.Just a local idiot.FORREST: And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.Forrest! Forrest! Run!- Okay!
- Run!Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!No! Turn! Go!He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,but he sure is fast!(ALL CHEERING)FORREST: Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.Federal troops enforcing a court orderintegrated the University
of Alabama today.Two negroes were admitted,but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threatto stand in the school house door.KATZENBACH: Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...Earl, what's going on?- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,Mama just chase them off with a broom.Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.With us? They do?REPORTER: Shortly after Governor
Wallace had carried out his promiseto block the doorway,President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defensethen to use military force.Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace....because these National Guardsmen
are here todayas federal soldiers for Alabamans.They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.We are winning in this fight,because we are awakening
the American peopleto the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.REPORTER: And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabamain Tuscaloosa had been desegregatedand students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malonehad been signed up
for summer classes.Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...HUNTLEY: Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...Say, wasn't that Gump?- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.FORREST: A few years later,
that angry little manat the school house door
thought it would be a good ideaand ran for president.(GUNSHOTS FIRING)But somebody thought that it wasn't.But he didn't die.My bus is here.- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.It was nice talking to you.I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.I was in college.Did you go to a girls' college,or to a girls-and-boys-together college?It was co-ed.'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.It was a college just for girls.But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.(JENNY EXCLAIMS)That hurts.Forrest! Forrest!- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- BILLY: Jesus!What are you doing?- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?- Just get away from me!
- Don't...- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.He doesn't know any better!Forrest, why did you do that?I brought you some chocolate.I'm sorry.- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...Look at you.Come on. Come on.- Is this your room?
- Shh!Do you ever dream, Forrest,about who you're gonna be?- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.Aren't I going to be me?Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.You know? I want to be famous.I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.I just want to be on an empty stagewith my guitar, my voice.Just me.And I want to reach people
on the personal level.I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.(EXCLAIMING)- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.It's all right.- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.I bet that never happened in Home Ec.(LAUGHING)No.I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.(WHISPERING) I don't care.
I don't like her, anyway.CROWD: Run! Run! Run!- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!FORREST: College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,where you get to meet
the President of the United States.REPORTER: President Kennedy met
with the CollegiateAll-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.FORREST: Now, the really good thing
about meetingthe President of the United States
is the food.They put you in this little room
with just about anythingyou'd want to eat or drink.And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,and number two, they was free,I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.(BURPS)KENNEDY: Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?PLAYER 1: It's an honor, sir.KENNEDY: Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?PLAYER 2: Very good, sir.Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?Very good, sir.- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.(CHUCKLING) I believe he said
he had to ""go pee.""FORREST: Sometime later,
for no particular reason,somebody shot that
nice young President,when he was riding in his car.And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,only he was in a hotel kitchen.It must be hard being brothers.I wouldn't know.Forrest Gump.FORREST: Now can you believe it?After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.Congratulations, son.Mama was so proud.Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.Congratulations, son.Have you given any thought
to your future?Thought?Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!This seat's taken.Taken.FORREST: At first, it seemed like
I made a mistake,seeing how it was only my induction dayand I was already getting yelled at.You can sit down if you want to.I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.You ever been on a real shrimp boat?No, but I been on a real big boat.I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,when I was about maybe nine.I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.FORREST: So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,and his mama cooked shrimp,and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.Bubba's family knew everythingthere was to know
about the shrimping business.I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myselfafter I get out the Army.Okay.Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!Listen up, people!FORREST: Now, for some reason, I fit in
the Army like one of them round pegs.It's not really hard.You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,and always answer every question
with, ""Yes, Drill Sergeant!""DRILL SERGEANT: Is that clear?- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,less what you spend on gas, you can...- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?You told me to, Drill Sergeant.Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole......shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp......shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...That's... That's about it.FORREST: Night time in the Army
is a lonely time.We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.And I'd miss Jenny.Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble oversome photos of her
in her college sweater,and she was thrown out of school.But that wasn't a bad thing,because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.The first chance I got,I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.That was Amber, Amber Flame.Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)MAN 1: All right!
MAN 2: Bobbi!(SINGING BLOWIN' IN THE WIND)Her dream had come true.She was a folk singer.MAN 3: Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.MAN 4: Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.(CROWD LAUGHING)MAN 1: Hey, honey,
this ain't Captain Kangaroo.Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!I'm singing a song here.Polly, get out here!- Shut up, there!
- MAN 2: Don't be so shy, honey.JENNY: Oh, shut up!Forrest, what are you doing here?- What are you doing?
- MAN 3: Hey!- Come on.
- What are you doing?Forrest, let me down!(CROWD EXCLAIMING)You can't keep doing this, Forrest.You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.I can't help it. I love you.Forrest, you don't know what love is.You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?Yes, I do.You think I could fly off this bridge?What do you mean, Jenny?Nothing.I gotta get out of here.Wait, Jenny...Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.Can I have a ride?- MAN: Where you going?
- I don't care.Get in the truck.So, bye-bye, Jenny.They sending me to Vietnam.It's this whole other country.Just hang on a minute.Listen, you promise me
something, okay?Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?Just run away.Okay.Jenny.I'll write you all the time.FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone.You come back safe to me,
do you hear?Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very differentfrom the United States of America.And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,we can get American shrimpersto come out here
and shrimp these waters.We'll just shrimp all the time, man.So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.You must be my FNGs.- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!Get your hands down! Do not salute me.There's goddamn snipers
all around this areawho would love to grease an officer.I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.What's wrong with your lip?I was born with big gums, sir.Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.Where you boys from in the world?- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!You twins?No, we are not relations, sir.Look, it's pretty basic here.If you stick with me
and learn from the guyswho've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.There is one item of GI gearthat can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.Try and keep your feet dry.When we're out humping,
I want you boys to rememberto change your socks whenever we stop.The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.Sergeant Sims, God damn it,where is that sling rope
I told you to order?I put in the requisitions at Battalion.DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...FORREST: Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.He was from a long,
great military tradition.Somebody in his family
had fought and diedin every single American war.- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.Get on it!I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.Little Rock's a fine town.Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,draw what you need for the field.If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.Two standing orders in this platoon:One, take good care of your feet,two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.I sure hope I don't let him down.FORREST: I got to see
a lot of the countryside.We would take these real long walks.And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.DAN: Hold it up!
SOLDIER: Hold up, boys!It wasn't always fun.Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...Get down! Shut up!(WHISPERING)... so we did.Now, I don't know much about anything,but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.There was Dallas, from Phoenix,Cleveland, he was from Detroit.(WHISPERING) Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.Man, what the hell's going on?And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.DAN: Nothing.Fourth Platoon, on your feet.Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.Come on, move out.Step it up. Look alive out there.The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.DAN: Fire in the hole!Gump, check out that hole.And there was always something to do.- Mount them up.
- SOLDIER: Spread out! Cover his back.One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:Little bitty stinging rain,and big old fat rain,rain that flew in sideways.And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.Shoot, it even rained at night.- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?'Cause we be watching out
for one another,like brothers and stuff.Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.I got a very important question
to ask you.How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?Okay.Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.We ain't got to pay no rent.I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.That's a fine idea.FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea.I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,and told her
how I thought about her always,and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from herjust as soon as she had the time.I'd always let her know that I was okay.Then, I'd sign each letter,
""Love, Forrest Gump.""This one day, we was out walking,
like always,and then, just like that,somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.DAN: Ambush!Take cover!(GUNS FIRING)Get down!Get the sixty!Get that pig up here, God damn it!Forrest, you okay?Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!Medic, we got a man down!Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree lineat points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...Misfire! Misfire!DAN: God damn it! Mac!Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!Jesus!My unit is down hard and hurting!Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.Pull back! Pull back!Run! Run, Forrest!- Pull back!
- BUBBA: Forrest, Forrest!Run, man! Run!DAN: Pull back! Run!Run, God damn it, run!SOLDIER: Medic! Can I get a medic?FORREST: I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,which was a bad thing.Bubba!Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.SOLDIER 1: Any friendlies out there?SOLDIER 2: Yeah, I've got
three over here.Where the hell are you?Bubba?And on my way back to find Bubba,well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.Tex!Okay.I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,somebody else was saying,
""Help me, Forrest. Help me.""Can't hear... Can't hear...SOLDIER: No sweat, man. Just lay back.You'll be okay. You'll be okay.I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.MAN ON RADIO: Over.DAN: Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.We got Charlie all over this area.I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.- Six, Strongarm, we want...
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!I know he's dead!My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
- God damn it!- Copy this transmission. Over.
- What are you doing?Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.God, I said leave me here, God damn it!Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advisedyour fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.FORREST: Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.Something bit me!You chink son of a bitch!I can't leave the platoon.I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!Did you hear what I said?God damn it, put me down!Get your ass out of here!I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!Where the hell
do you think you're going?To get Bubba.I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!I gotta find Bubba!BUBBA: Forrest.- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.I'm okay.Oh, Bubba, no...Nah, I'm gonna be all right.(MEN CHATTERING)Come on. Come on. Come on.I'm okay, Forrest.I'm okay, man. I'm fine.DAN: Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,I'd of thought of something better to say.Hey, Bubba.Hey, Forrest.Forrest, why'd this happen?You got shot.Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.I wanna go home.Bubba was my best good friend.And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.That's all I have to say about that.It was a bullet, wasn't it?- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.Oh, yes, sir.Bit me directly in the buttocks.They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocksis the ice cream.They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.And guess what?A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.MALE NURSE:
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.Harper!Cooper, Larson,Webster,- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.Kyle, Nichols,McMill, Johnson, Tyler,Holiday...MAN ON TV:
Surprise, surprise, surprise!Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?- From the DMZ to the Delta...
- Turn it off!...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.This is Channel 6, Saigon.SOLDIER: Good catch, Gump.You know how to play this?Come on, let me show you. Here.Now, the secret to this game is,no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.All right.For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.See? Any idiot can play.So, I started playing it all the time.I played Ping-Pongeven when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,whatever that means.Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.I should have died out there
with my men,but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!Do you see that?Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?Yes, sir, I do.Did you hear what I said?You cheated me.I had a destiny.I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.I had a destiny.I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.You're still Lieutenant Dan.Look at me.What am I gonna do now?PFC Gump?Yes, sir!As you were.Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?They sent him home.FORREST:
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the Presidentregarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honorto men
from each of the Armed Services.America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.I'd kind of like to see that.(CHUCKLING)God damn, son.After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.ISABEL: Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,what do you want me to do with them?HILARY: What are you doing here
so late?It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowdedwith people looking
at all the statues and monuments,and some of them people were loud
and pushy.Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.HILARY: Follow me, let's go!Come on. Let's go.Stand here.Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!Okay.There was this man giving a little talk.And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.ABBIE HOFFMAN: Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...FORREST:
And he liked to say the ""F"" word.A lot. ""F"" this and ""F"" that.And every time he said the ""F"" word,people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer....where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!(CROWD CHEERING)Yeah! Yeah!Come on, man, come up here, man.Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.Tell us a little bit about the war, man.The war in Vietnam?- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
- Yeah!(CROWD CHEERING)MAN 1: Peace!MAN 2: Come on, man, go!MAN 3: Come on!
WOMAN 1: Peace!Well...FORREST: There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam....there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.In Vietnam, your...(SPEAKERS SCREECHING)MAN 4: Hey, what the hell are you...I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?MAN 5: We can't hear you!MAN 6: We can't hear anything!- This one! This one! Give me that!
- MAN 7: Turn it up!WOMAN 2: Speak up!That's it!...and that's all I have to say about that.That's so right on, man. You said it all.What's your name, man?My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.Forrest Gump!- Gump!
- Gump!JENNY: Forrest! Forrest!- Jenny!
- Forrest!Hey! Hey!It was the happiest moment of my life.Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.She showed me around,and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.Shut that blind, man.And get your white ass
away from that window.Don't you know we in a war here?Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?Our purpose here
is to protect our black leadersfrom the racial onslaught of the pigwho wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.Who's the baby killer?This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.Forrest, this is Wesley.Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.Let me tell you something else.We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontlineto die for a country that hates them.Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fightand come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communitiesas they sleep in their beds at night.You are a fucking asshole!Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.JENNY: Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!Forrest!Stop it! Stop it!Oh, God...I shouldn't have brought you here.I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.He should not be hitting you, Jenny.Come on, Forrest.Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.I would never hurt you, Jenny.I know you wouldn't, Forrest.I wanted to be your boyfriend.That uniform is a trip, Forrest.You look handsome in it. You do.- You know what?
- What?I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.Me, too, Forrest.We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mindand learn how to live in harmony,which must be out west somewhere,'cause she made it
all the way to California.(SINGING)
Try to love one another right nowHIPPIE: Hey!Anybody want to go to San Francisco?- I'll go.
- Far out.It was a very special night
for the two of us.I didn't want it to end.I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.I have to, Forrest.Jenny?Things got a little out of hand.It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!I would never hurt you, you know that.You know what I think?I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.I want you to have this.Forrest, I can't keep this.I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.Why are you so good to me?You're my girl.I'll always be your girl.FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone, out of my life again.NEIL ARMSTRONG ON TV:
That's one small step for man,one giant leap for mankind.FORREST: I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communistswas to play Ping-Pong.So, I was in the Special Services,traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veteransand showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.I was so good that some years laterthe Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.We were the first Americans
to visit the land of Chinain like a million years,
or something like that.Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,but all I did was play Ping-Pong.When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.Mr. Gump, have a seat.Forrest Gump, John Lennon.- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.Can you tell us, what was China like?In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.No possessions?And in China, they never go to church.No religion, too?Oh.- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.FORREST: Some years later,
that nice young man from Englandwas on his way home
to see his little boyand was signing some autographs,and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.Lieutenant Dan!They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!Yes, sir, they surely did.They gave you,an imbecile,
a moron who goes on televisionand makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,the Congressional Medal of Honor.Yes, sir.Well, then, that's just perfect!Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.God damn bless America.Hey!Oh, God!- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.And because he didn't have no legs,he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.DAN: Take a right. Take a right.CABBIE: Hey! Come on, already!What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?I'm living off the government tit.(HORN HONKING)Sucking it dry!Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.(LAUGHING)That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,that's all they ever talk about.Jesus this and Jesus that.Have I found Jesus?They even had a priest come
and talk to me.He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.How if I accept Jesus into my heart,I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.Did you hear what I said?Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.Well, kiss my crippled ass.God is listening? What a crock of shit.I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.Oh?Well,before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.DAN: What the hell
is in Bayou La Batre?FORREST: Shrimping boats.
DAN: Shrimping boats?Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?FORREST: I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,soon as I have some money.I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnamthat as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.(LAUGHING)Now hear this!Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.LENORE: Danny, what are you
complaining about?- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,'cause Tommy bought a round
on the houseand gave everybody a turkey sandwich.Well, well, I had company.Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.- CARLA: Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.FORREST: It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,I began to think about Jenny,wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.CROWD: Eight, seven, six, five,four, three, two, one!Happy New Year!(CROWD CHEERING)(CROWD SINGING AULD LANG SYNE)Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?What's his problem?Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?What, is your friend stupid
or something?What did you say?I said, is your friend stupid
or something?Hey! Don't call him stupid!LENORE: Hey, don't you push her!
DAN: You shut up!- Don't you ever call him stupid!
- CARLA: What's the matter, baby?- Why are you so upset?
- DAN: Just get the hell out of here.- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not!- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!Go on! Get out of here!Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!Get out of here!(LAUGHING)- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.No, no.I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.She tasted like cigarettes.FORREST:
I guess Lieutenant Dan figuredthere's some things
you just can't change.He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.Happy New Year, Gump.The US Ping-Pong teammet with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.So, I went, again.And I met the President
of the United States, again.Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.I'll have my people
take care of it for you.Security, Frank Wills.Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance manover to that office across the way.The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.Okay, sir. I'll check it out.- Thank you.
- No problem.- Good night.
- Good night.Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.Vice President Fordwill be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...Sergeant Gump.- Yes, sir!
- As you were.I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?For the Army it does.FORREST: And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.So, I went home.- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.- Louise, he's here.
- FORREST: Now, when I got home,I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.One man even left a check for $25,000if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.I know that. I know that.But it's $25,000, Forrest.I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
- That Mama, she sure was right.- You look real good.
- It's funny how things work out.I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,and I always try to keep my promise.So, I went on down to Bayou La Batreto meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.Are you crazy, orjust plain stupid?Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.I guess.And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.Tell me something.SHRIMPER: Are you stupid
or something?Stupid is as stupid does, sir.Well, that's what's left after me saying,""When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,""I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,""which everybody knows isn't true,but Mama says it's just a little white lieso it wouldn't hurt nobody.So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new netsand a brand-new shrimping boat.Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,but you know what I found out?Shrimping is tough.I only caught five.A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.(CHUCKLING)Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,the most beautiful name
in the wide world.(GET DOWN TONIGHT PLAYING)Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,but I thought about her a lot,and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.I thought about Jenny all the time.(LAUGHS)Hey!Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.Yes, I know that.You wrote me a letter, you idiot.Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captainthat I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you ""sir.""No, sir.That's my boat.DAN: I have a feeling if we head
due east, we'll find some shrimp,so take a left.- Take a left!
- Which way?Over there! They're over there!- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!That's where we'll find them.- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.How are we going to find them?Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.(SINGING GOSPEL MUSIC)FORREST:
So, I went to church every Sunday.Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,though I think
he left the praying up to me.- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.- DAN: You'll never sink this boat!
- Now, me, I was scared,but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.Come on!You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!It's time for a showdown! You and me!I'm right here! Come and get me!(CACKLING)You'll never sink this boat!Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,destroying nearly everything in its path.And as in other towns
up and down the coast,Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industryhas fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.FORREST: After that,
shrimping was easy.Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktailsand barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 Jennys,a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say ""Bubba-Gump"" on them.Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.Hold on there, boy.Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.(LAUGHING)Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.We was sitting next to a millionaire.Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?Well, yes, I would.That's him right there.And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...Forrest,I never thanked you for saving my life.FORREST: He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.(GUNSHOTS FIRING)For the second time in 17 days,President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.MARGO: Base to Jenny 1.- Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.Forrest has a phone call.Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.Hi, Forrest.- DOCTOR: I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.Come on in, sit down over here.- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.It's just my time.Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.Death is just a part of life,something we're all destined to do.I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.You have to do the best
with what God gave you.What's my destiny, Mama?You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.You never know
what you're going to get.Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.I will miss you, Forrest.She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.And that's all I have to say about that.Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?There'll be another one along shortly.Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabamadecided to get together
and offered me a fine job.So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.And so then, I got a call from him sayingwe don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,""That's good. One less thing.""(SINGING GOSPEL MUSIC)Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,and the rest is just for showing off.So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.You know what?She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.That smells wonderful.And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,I cut that grass for free.But at night time
when there was nothing to doand the house was all empty,I'd always think of Jenny.And then, she was there.- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.Jenny came back and stayed with me.Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bedand slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.It was wonderful having her home.Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.Jenny most of the time was real quiet.How could you do this?(CRYING)Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.And she even showed me how to dance.And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.And it was the happiest time in my life.MAN ON TV: And this Fourth is
witnessing one of thelargest fireworks displays
in the nation's...- You done watching it?
...here in New York Harbor...- I'm going to bed.
...with a spectacular displayof tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...Will you marry me?I'd make a good husband, Jenny.You would, Forrest.But you won't marry me.You don't want to marry me.Why don't you love me, Jenny?I'm not a smart man,but I know what love is.Jenny.Forrest, I do love you.- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.REPORTER: President Carter, sufferingfrom heat exhaustion,
fell into the arms of...FORREST: And when I got there,I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.And I figured since I'd run this far,maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.And that's what I did.I ran clear across Alabama.For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.I ran clear to the ocean.And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,might as well turn around
and just keep on going.And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.When I had to go, you know...I went.And so, you just ran.Yeah.(RUNNING ON EMPTY PLAYING)FORREST: I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.But most of all, I thought about Jenny.I thought about her a lot.For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,has been running across America.Charles Cooper brings us this report.For the fourth time
on his journey across America,Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- Sir, why are you running?Why are you running?Are you doing this for world peace?Are you doing this for the homeless?- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?Or for animals?FORREST: They just couldn't believe
that somebody would do all that runningfor no particular reason.REPORTER: Why are you doing this?I just felt like running.It's you. I can't believe it's really you.Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?I said,
""Here's a guy that's got his act together.""Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.""Here's somebody who has the answer.""
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.So, I got company.And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker businessand I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!- It happens.
- What, shit?Sometimes.And some years later,
I heard that that fellowdid come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,and he made a lot of money off of it.Another time, I was running along,somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.FORREST: Have a nice day.Well, some years later,I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.He made a lot of money off of it.Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.My mama always said,""You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on.""And I think that's what
my running was all about.I had run for three years, two months,14 days and 16 hours.Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.I'm pretty tired.Think I'll go home now.Now what are we supposed to do?And just like that,
my running days was over.So, I went home to Alabama.REPORTER: Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...(GUNSHOTS FIRING)...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...I picked up the mail.And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,and that's what I'm doing here.She saw me on TV, running.I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Streetand get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.Why, you don't need to take a bus.Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.- Down that way?
- Down that way.It was nice talking to you.(CAR HORN HONKING)I hope everything works out for you!Hey!Forrest!How you doing? Come in, come in!I got your letter.I was wondering about that.Is this your house?Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.It's nice. You got air conditioning.- Thank you.
- I ate some.Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.There you are.And this, I got you running.I ran a long way,for a long time.And there...Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...(KNOCKING AT DOOR)Yoo-hoo!- Hey.
- Hi.Hey, you.- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?JENNY: Listen, next week my schedule
changes, so I'll be able to... But thanks...No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.His name's Forrest.Like me.I named him after his daddy.He got a daddy named Forrest, too?You're his daddy, Forrest.Hey.Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.Okay?Isn't he beautiful?He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.But...Is he smart, or...He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.Forrest,I'm sick.What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?I have some kind of virus,and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,and there isn't anything
they can do about it.You could come home with me.Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.I'll take care of you if you're sick.Would you marry me, Forrest?Okay.MINISTER: Please take your seats.Forrest? It's time to start.Hi.Your tie.Lieutenant Dan.Hello, Forrest.You got new legs. New legs!Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.Magic legs.This is my fiancée, Susan.- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.MINISTER: Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?And so I pronounce you man and wife.- Hey.
- Hey.Hey, Forrest.Were you scared in Vietnam?Yes. Well, I...I don't know.Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.And then it was nice.It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.There was always
a million sparkles on the water.Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,I couldn't tell where heaven stoppedand the earth began.It was so beautiful.I wish I could've been there with you.You were.I love you.You died on a Saturday morning.And I had you placed
here under our tree.And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.Mamaalways said that dying was a part of life.I sure wish it wasn't.Little Forrest is doing just fine.But...About to start school again soon,and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.Okay.He's really good.Forrest, you go.We fish a lot.(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.You'd be so proud of him.I am.He wrote you a letter.And he says I can't read it.I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.Jenny,I don't know if Mama was right,or if it's Lieutenant Dan.I don't knowif we each have a destiny,or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.But I thinkmaybe it's both.Maybe both is happening
at the same time.But I miss you, Jenny.If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.Here's your bus. Okay.Hey. I know this.I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell becauseGrandma used to read it to you.My favorite book.Here we are.Okay.Here you go.Hey, Forrest, don't...- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.I'll be right here when you get back.You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump."
Crash|2004|74|Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito|Paul Haggis|"It's the sense of touch.What?Any real city, you walk,
you know?You brush past people.
People bump into you.In L.A., nobody touches you.We're always behind

just so we can feel something.You guys okay?I think he hit his head.You don't think that's true?Stay in your car.Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.I think we spun around twice.And somewhere in there, one of us lost
our frame of reference.And I'm gonna
go look for it.- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!I need to see your registration
and insurance.Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!- She do this!
- My fault?Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.- My fault?
- Stop in middle of street!Mexicans no know how to drive.- She ""blake"" too fast.
- I ""blake"" too fast? I ""blake"" too fast.- I'm sorry you no see my ""blake"" lights.
- Ma'am.See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.Maybe you see over

- That's what I heard.- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.Yeah, me too.- What do you got?
- Dead kid.Hey, Bob.You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.What do you want?- Are you making insult at me?
- Am I making insult ""at"" you?- Is that the closest you can come to English?
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.- Oh, God, here we go.
- I have right like you.- I have right to buy gun.
- Not in my store, you don't!- Andy, get him outta here now!
- Go wait in the car.Now. Get out!- You're an ignorant man!
- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my countryand I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!- Andy, now!
- Let's go.Okay.You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.And I am really hoping
for the money.- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.We got a lot of kinds.We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,flat nose, hollowpoints,
wide cutters,and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.I'll take the ones
in the red box.- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?And how many cups of coffee
did we get?You don't drink coffee!
And I didn't want any.Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?Did you notice
that our waitress was black?And black women don't think
in stereotypes?You tell me. When was
the last time you met onewho didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy assbefore you even opened
your mouth, huh?That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.How much did you leave?You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?I'm seriously starting to think that
you're jealous of Karen.Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.Okay, no more phone calls. As a matter of fact,
you can hold the battery.Okay?Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?- You see that?
- She's cold.She got colder
as soon as she saw us.- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.You couldn't find a whiter, safer or better-lit
part of this city right now.But yet this white woman
sees two black guyswho look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,and her reaction
is blind fear?Look at us, dog. Are we dressed
like gangbangers?Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white peoplepatrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?'Cause we got guns?You could be right.- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dog.You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?""Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find""?Why the hell do you do that?Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup is a cop
coming off shift.This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.I got the Mercedes.Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.Shot back in self-defense.- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.Find me a witness.That is a nice gun.The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.And that's not Cindy.That is a William Lewis.Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.Thank you.You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?I need to talk to you
for a second.You just give me a minute,
all right?- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.Yes, honey?I want the locks changed
again in the morning.You want...Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.It's okay. Just go to bed.You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?I'm sorry, Miss Jean.Is okay I go home now?It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.- You're welcome, no problem. Good night.
- Good night.We'll see you tomorrow.I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.And you might mention
that we'd appreciate itif next time they didn't send
a gang member.- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really? And he's not gonna sell our keyto one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?We've had a tough night.- It'd be best if you went...
- And wait for them to break in?I just had a gun
pointed in my face.You lower your voice!And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.Fuck!Why did these guys
have to be black?I mean, why?
No matter how we spin this,I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.Bruce?The firefighter.The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?He's Iraqi.He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.Give yourself a raise!It's been good
doing business with you.- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.Bronson Avenue, Westwood.Vehicle is described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.California plates,
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.That's not it. That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.They were doin' something!Enthusiastic.Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.I'm gonna need to see your driver's license
and registration.No problem.I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.How are you tonight, Officer?Excellent.Here you go.Stay inside the vehicle, please.Let's do it again right now.Step outta the car, please, sir.Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.Then we shouldn't have
a problem.He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.No, it's okay.It's fine.Step onto the sidewalk, sir.That's good. Right there.Look at me.I want you to stand
on your right foot.Touch your nose with the index finger
of your left hand.I told you he doesn't drink.Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.Don't you ""ma'am"" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.Wait. We're only a block
away from our house.Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!- Put your hands...
- And you keep your filthy hands off me!You motherfucking pig!- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.Of course you know that.Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.Put your legs open.Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?You'd be surprised
some of the places I've found weapons.He's clean.What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on youwhile you were operating
a motor vehicle.That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.You say you're a block
from home.We could use our discretionand let you go with a warning,or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.What do you think
we should do, sir?Look, we're sorry, andwe would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning, please.The man's apologizing, Tommy.I think we can let him go. Don't you?Yeah.All right.You can go.You folks drive safe now, huh?Let's go, Tommy.It won't close.I can do that.Dad, you couldn't even
get it open.Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?Farhad, it won't close.Dorri, you should be at work.Who are you calling?I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?Do you have any idea how that felt? To have
that pig's hands all over me?And you just stood there!And then you apologized
to him?What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotchthan get your name
in the paper.You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,that's exactly
what I was worried about.Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good
friends at the studiowere gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?You need to calm down
right now.What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.Fuck you, man.
Like you know.The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.At least I wasn't watching it with
the rest of the equestrian team.You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?You know, fuck you!That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!How's it goin'Okay.You didn't get scared
or something, did you?There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.There's no such thing
as monsters.- Ah, that's a good thing.
- I heard a bang.Like a truck bang?Like a gun.That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.And there's not
too many guns around here.How far can bullets go?They go pretty far.But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.What if they don't?You thinking about that bullet that came
through your window?'Cause we never
did find it, did we?I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.Hmm. You think it was that same
bullet that you heard tonight?You think
we should move again?I like it here.Me too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...Oh, hold on.What?So stupid!
How can I forget this?What?Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.Tell me.Okay.When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.- Right.
- I told you, you weren't gonna believe me.- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.Okay.So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
""Yeah, right, you're a fairy.""Anyway, we're talking, you know.And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.She was flying?She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.So she said, ""I'll prove it.""So she reaches
into her backpack.And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.She ties it around my neck,
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.You know what
impenetrable means?It means that nothing
can go through it.No bullets. Nothing.She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.And I forgot.Can I touch it?Sure, go ahead.- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?No, not anymore.So what do you think?
You want it?Okay, let's get outta here.Okay.Put your head up.Okay. Is that too tight?Do you feel anything at all?Good. Then
it's just right.Do I take it off
when I have a bath?No, you leave it on
all the time.Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.Okay?Okay.Okay.
Good night, sweetie.Good night.Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop
music of the oppressor?Listen to it, man!
""Nigger this, nigger that.""You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?""Hey, honky, how's business?""""Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying.""How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.And you think there's
a difference, don't you? Huh?Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a niggerYou have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my triggerSee, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my headLike Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.Gonna string 'em up goodThese brothers were speaking out good,
and people were listening!Then they'll be deadThen the FBI said,
""No, we can't have that.""Home of the brave
and the land of the free""Let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiotsand sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobodywill be able to understand
a fucking word they say.End of problem.""What the fuck
was that, dog?- Holy shit!
- What?Man, we done ran over
a Chinaman.You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?What part don't you understand?There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.- Help me.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?Man! This is so
completely fucked up.Oh, really? No shit!Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.- Get back in the truck.
- What?- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.He's not gonna let go, Anthony.You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.Then what your ass
gonna do, huh?If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.He's been on the force
for a long time.Seventeen years.And I do have
to work here, sir.So you don't mind that there's
a racist prick on the force.You just don't want him
to ride in your car.If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.That'd be great.
Write a full report.Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigotcould've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.You wanna know what I heard?I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.You want me to say
he has flatulence?Not him. You. You have
uncontrollable flatulence.You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.And how easily
that can be taken away.Now, that being said,
it's your decision.You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problemof a personal nature.Fuck.Excuse me.Excuse me. Sir?You finished?I replaced the lock. But you got
a real problem with that door.You fix the lock?Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, listen to me.What you need
is a new door.- I need new door?
- Yeah.Okay. How much?I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.Then go and fix
the fucking lock, you cheater.You... You know what?Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!You cheat!
You fucking cheater!- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.You watch the Discovery Channel?- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.Every night there is a show with somebody
shining a blue lightand finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.The next thing they show is some
stupid redneck in handcuffswho looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.Sometimes the redneck is actually
watching the Discovery Channelwhen they break in
to arrest him.And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?No.Then get the fuck
outta my shop.Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.Don't.Graham Waters.No. No, he's not here, Mom.I'm not gonna go
looking for him.Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.Okay, where were we?I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.Oh, shit!Come on.I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.That's just where
I begin to get pissed.I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.Okay. I was raised badly.Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.Neither one of those is Mexico.Ah. Then I guess
the big mystery iswho gathered all those remarkably
different cultures togetherand taught them all how to park
their cars on their lawns?Pop, you okay?If I could piss, I'd be okay.I'm... Jesus.I'm done now.Give me a hand.Wait a goddamn minute!- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.All right. Okay. Okay.Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!- I gotta go back.
- Okay.What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.- They know each other? It's a grudge thing?
- Sir.Not as far as we can tell.You think this is
racially motivated?Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.Waters. Tell him he speaks
to no one but me.Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.And would someone
please find Flanagan.Oh! What up, Mo Phat?Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
""Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?""That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?The man steals
from black people.Only reason black people
steal from their own- is 'cause they terrified of white people.
- Man, please.Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say ""decaf latte.""What the fuck did you do to my car?Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.I turn key to my car,
but nothing.James wanted
to take this to school.But I don't want the kids
to fight over it.- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.Si, senora.
No problem.I'm startin' to understand now.By your work, you're settin'
an example for our neighborhood.Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?Yeah, you laugh, man.But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?Wavin' down the bus.Put your hand down, dog!
Are you outta your mind?You actually expect me
to get on a bus?No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.You have no idea, do you?You have no idea why they put them great
big windows on the sides of buses, do you?- Why?
- One reason only.To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.I didn't know that.You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!I love hockey.Cut! Print. Moving on.Okay, that takes us into scene 12.Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.Right on.- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.Yeah. Listen.
I think we need another take, buddy.That looked pretty terrific, man.This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?What do you mean?Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,but have you noticed he's talking
a lot less black lately?No, I haven't noticed that.Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed
to say, ""Don't be talkin' 'bout that.""And he changed it to,
""Don't talk to me about that.""Wait a minute.You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?- Come on!
- Is there a problem, Cam?Excuse me?Is there a problem, Cam?No, we don't have
a problem.I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,
it's not his character.Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.Jamal, um...Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?Hold for a minute, please.
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,but you have a walk-in,
Mr. Ryan.Send him in.- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.My name is Shaniqua Johnson.I believe we spoke last night.Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.This doctor he's been seein' says
he's got a urinary tract infection.But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.- Really?
- No offense.But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's
welcome to see a doctor outside the network.And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.All right.
You know what I can't do?I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or sixmore qualified white men
who didn't get your job.It's time for you to go.I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.I'm hoping that someone like yourself,someone who may have
been given a helping hand,might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.Carol, I need security
in my office!You don't like me,
that's fine. I'm a prick.My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.Saved enough to start
his own company.Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.Paid 'em equal wages when
no one else was doing that.For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.Then the city council decidesto give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.And overnight,
my father loses everything.His business, his home,
his wife. Everything!Not once does he blame
your people.I'm not asking you
to help me.I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everythingso people like yourself
could reap the benefits.And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?Nothing.Just a flick of your pen.Your father sounds like
a good man.And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.- Get him the hell outta my office.
- Prick.Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.He say he fix the lock.- You come here, see how ""fix-ed"" it is!
- You're yelling again.I am not yelling!
I'm upset!Yes... Yes, I am.Mom, are you all right?Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.Okay?Look what they wrote.They think we're Arab.When did Persian
become Arab?I want his name. Yes.Oh, my God.- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?I'm not giving you
his name, sir.- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!I'm gonna hang up now, sir.Don't hang up! Shit!Oh, thank God.Mom?Mom, it's cold.
Come on.Did you find your brother?No, Mom.I was doin' good.I was... I was doin' real good.- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...It's okay.Did you find your brother?No, Mom.Tell him to come home.Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?Okay, Mom.Okay, baby.Okay.Okay.- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.Internal Affairs called. Found something
in the Mercedes.That's lunch. One hour.I tried to call.- Sounded like you're havin' a bad day, huh?
- Yeah.What?I got scared, Cam.It's not like I haven't been pulled over before.
You know?But not like that.And, yes,
I was a little drunk.And I was mouthing off.I'm sorry.But when that man was putting
his hands on me...I don't wanna talk about it.I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?But I was humiliated!For you.I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.Yeah. That's what happened.- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.I ain't doin' it.You gonna walk away
from me?- Cameron!
- Just go home.Mm-hmm. I understand.Thanks.- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?Yes. I tell him, fix it.They said their man told youto fix the door,
and you didn't do so.Are you saying it's his fault?Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering this.No. This store is all we have.I really am sorry.What time
you must go to work?Not until tonight.Go home and sleep.It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.Hey.Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.Yeah, they told me.I just wanted to say,
good luckand it was good
ridin' with you.You too.Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.You think you know
who you are, hmm?You have no idea.Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?Ready, amigo.Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.21-L-23, picking up strange noises
from your car.21-L, is your mike open
by any chance?Call it in.Ma'am?Can you hear me?Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.Ma'am, are you hurt?- Can you move?
- L... I can't breathe.Okay, I'm gonna get you out.It's okay.Okay. Okay.Okay, I'm gonna get
you out.No!- It's okay.
- Get away from me!Get away.
Stay away from me!Not you! Not you!- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'- - I'm tryin' to help you.Fuck you!
Not you!Somebody!
Anybody else!- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!Okay. Okay.Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yetand that's gasoline there.We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?Yeah. Yeah.Thanks.Is anything broken?L-I don't think so.Okay. Then that's good.Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?Yeah, I'm gonna get
you out. Okay?Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.Oh, fuck!- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?I'm gonna have to cut the belt.It's okay, it's okay.It's okay. Okay,
we're gonna get you out.Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.Everything's gonna be fine.Ryan!Pull!It's okay.It's okay.All right.
It's okay, it's okay.It's all right.
I got it. I got it.Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?It's cool, it's cool.Here we go. All right,
you're doin' great.The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work none
of us would have jobs.- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two
suspicious shootings on his record.Both black men. Both times he was cleared,
but only just.Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.You know any reason why we shouldn't
hang Conklin for this?Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.Shit!Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not
have known the money was in it.You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?Latasha Harlins,
Rodney King.- These names ring a bell, Detective?
- Yeah, vaguely.We have attorneys for this slain police officer
camping in our offices.We have his mother
and a half dozen men of the clothwho swear that Lewis was one of
the twelve apostles of Christ.We have two black city councilmenand a congresswoman
who call on the hour, every hour,demanding to know what the district attorney
intends to do about this.And you want him to walk
into that press roomand tell them all that
the situation is complicated?Give us a minute.No problem.Who knows about the money?You gotta be kiddin' me.There are only two people
in this room.Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't clear
evidence of any wrongdoing.And even if it was, we aren't going to
prosecute a dead man.Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.You can do this dance
if you want to,but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrowit's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.Fucking black people, huh?What did you just say?I mean,I know all the sociological
reasons why per capitaeight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.All that stuff.
All that stuff!But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.Of course, you and I know
that's not the truth.But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?And assholes like Lewis keep feeding
the flames. It's gotta get to you.What did you say
you did for the D.A. Again?You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?Oh, please, don't do that.Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?What do you think those kids need... to make
them believe, to give them hope?You think they need another
drug-dealing copor do you think they need
a fallen black hero?Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.Rick is quite adamant that his replacement
be a person of color.It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.And the right message is,
""Look at this black boy I just bought?""Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.Actually we were thinking of you.Until we saw that.It's your brother's file.Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.Christ, that's a shitty law.There's a warrant in there.But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.Fucking black people, huh?So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappearis to frame
a potentially innocent man?What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valleywas enough to get him killed.There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.Which means we
could get this wrong.Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.You're the one closest to all this.You need to tell us.What does your gut tell you?So? Graham?What do I tell 'em?You tell me, and I'll tell them.Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,it's pretty clear
what happened last night.Okay.Before I get to why we're here,I know that many of you have heard we had
our car stolen last night.And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.But we're okay.And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.Now, just after 9.'00 p.m. Last night,
Detective William Lewis,an eight-year veteran of the force and an
active member of the black community,was gunned down
by a fellow officer.Get outta the car!Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?Whoa! What the fuck

- You stupid motherfucker!Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!- Man, what the fuck? Get off!

- I'll blow your head off!- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!Stop talkin' and shoot!- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!Get the fuck outta my car!Shit! Damn!- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
Oh, Christ!- Get the fuck outta the car!

- It's my fucking car!- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!Gimme my fucking gun!Fuck!Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!Slowly step out
of the vehicle.- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!Lie face down on the ground.- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!On your knees now!You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.Step away.Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.Fuck you!Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off- and onto that man's patio.
- Officer Hanson, step away.He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a fucking friend! This man is not armed!He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!You startin' to understand
the situation?What do you want from me?Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your headand do nothing until I speak
with these officers.I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?Yeah, I can do that.Good.I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.I need this favor.You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.I need to let him go
with a warning.- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.Thank you.You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?Go home.Yeah, that I can do.Look at me.You embarrass me.You embarrass yourself.Daddy's home!- What's up?
- Give me my money!- What? What money?
- Daddy!- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!Give me my money!- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.Fifty dollars?
You took everything!- Mommy?
- I'm coming, I'm coming!- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!Lara, stay outta the street!- It's okay, Daddy.
- What... What?I'll protect you.It's okay. Daddy's okay.It's a really good cloak.How's it goin'I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.Well, you are one to talk.You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.Yes! At them! Yes!At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today,at the gardener who keeps
over-watering the lawn.I...I just thought that...Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up todayand I would feel better,
you know?But I was still mad.
And I realized...I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.I wake up like this
every morning!I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.Carol, I don't know why!
And I...Yeah, yeah, call me back.Bye.Really appreciate this.No problem.So how long you been

these Chinamen?Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.Entirely different kind of chinks.- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?

I'll be home in 20 minutes.It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.Carol was the only one

Feel better.I'll be there soon.I love you.I love you too.Miss Jean.Would you like to sit up?Here. Good!Do you wanna hear
something funny?What, Mrs. Jean?You're the best friend
I've got.Hi.Hi.I love you.All right.Everybody out, man.

Braveheart|1995|77|Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack|Mel Gibson|"<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i><i>Historians from England will say I am a liar.</i><i>But history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.</i><i>The King of Scotland had died without a son.</i><i>And the King of England...</i><i>...a cruel pagan known as
Edward the Longshanks...</i><i>...claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.</i><i>Scotland's nobles fought him...</i><i>...and fought each other over the crown.</i><i>So Longshanks invited them
to talks of a truce.</i><i>No weapons. One page only.</i><i>One farmer of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace...</i><i>...a commoner with his own lands.</i><i>He had two sons: John and William.</i>I told you to stay!Well, I finished my work.
Where are we going?MacAndrews'. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.- Can I come?
- No! Go home, boy!- But I want to go!
- Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand!Away hame, William.MacAndrews!MacAndrews!Holy Jesus.- William! William!It's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.And I say we hit back now!- We cannae fight them.
- Something's got to be done.Wallace is right! We fight them!Every nobleman willing to fight
was at that meeting!We cannot beat an army!
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.We do not have to beat them...
Just fight them.- Now, who's with me?
- I am, Wallace.- All right, all right.
- Aye.- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going with you.Och, are ye?
And what are you going to do?I'm gonna help.Aye, and a good help you'd be, too.But I need you to stay here......and look after the place for me
while I'm away.I can fight!I know! I know you can fight.But it's our wits that make us men.See ye tomorrow.- English!
- Get down.With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm!It's up to us, Hamish.Nah!Da?Da?William.Come here, lad.<i>De profundis...</i><i>...clamavi ad te, Domine.</i><i>Domine, exaudi vocem meam.</i><i>Fiant aures tuae intendentes...</i><i>...in vocem deprecationis meae.</i><i>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.</i><i>Et lux perpetua luceat eis.</i><i>Requiescant in pace.</i>Amen.Amen.William.I'm your uncle. Argyle.You have the look of your mother.We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.I don't want to leave!You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?But it happened.Did the priest give a poetic benediction?- The Lord bless thee and keep thee...
- It was in Latin.You don't speak Latin?Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy.The Lord......bless thee and keep thee.The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee......and give thee peace.Amen.<i>Your heart is free.</i><i>Have the courage to follow it.</i>What are they doing?Saying goodbye in their own way.Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.It was the same for me and your daddy......when our father was killed.First, learn to use......this.Then I'll teach you... to use......this.<i>Many years later...</i><i>...Edward the Longshanks,
King of England...</i><i>...supervised the wedding of his eldest son,
who would succeed him as king.</i>Amen.<i>As bride for his son...</i><i>...Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival...</i><i>...the King of France.</i><i>It was widely whispered
that for the Princess to conceive...</i><i>...Longshanks would have
to do the honours himself.</i><i>That may have been
what he had in mind all along.</i>Scotland...My land.The French will grovel
to anyone with strength.But how will they believe our strength
when we cannot rule the whole of our island?Where is my son?Your pardon, my Lord.He asked me to come in his stead.I sent for him and he sends you?Shall I leave, my Lord?If he wants his queen to rule
when I am gone......then by all means stay
and learn how. Please.Nobles.Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.Grant our nobles lands in the North.Give their nobles estates here in England.And make them too greedy to oppose us.But, sir, our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot.New lands mean new taxes and they're
already taxed for the war in France.Are they?Are they?The trouble with Scotland......is that it's full of Scots.Perhaps the time has come......to reinstitute an old custom.Grant them ""primae noctis"".First night.When any common girl
inhabiting their lands is married......our nobles shall have sexual rights to her
on the night of her wedding.If we can't get them out......we'll breed them out.That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland.Taxes or no taxes, eh?A most excellent idea, sire.Is it?<i>Now, in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.</i><i>Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce...</i><i>...a leading contender
for the crown of Scotland.</i>I hear that Longshanks
has granted ""primae noctis"".Clearly meant to draw
more of his supporters here.My father believes we must lull
Longshanks into our confidence......by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.- A wise plan.
- How is your father? He missed the council.His affairs in France keep him long overdue.But he sends his greetings.And he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces......and for Scotland.- You've dropped your rock.
- A test of manhood.- You win.
- Ah-hah!Call it a test of soldiery, then.The English won't let us train with weapons,
so we train with stones.The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.No. It's here.- Hamish?
- Mm-hm.Here you go, son. Show him how.- Come on, Hamish!
- Come on, boy!Come on!That's a good throw.Aye. Aye, it was.I was wondering
if you could do that when it matters.As it... as it matters in battle.Could you crush a man with that throw?I could crush you... like a worm.Oooh!- You could?
- Aye.Well, then, do it.Would you like to see him
crush me like a worm?- Come and do it.
- You'll move.- I will not.
- Right.He'll move.Come on, Hamish!Come on there, boy!Well done!A fine display, young Wallace.Are you all right?
You look a wee bit shaky.I should have remembered the rocks.Aye, you should have.Get up, you big heap of...- It's good to see ye again.
- Aye, welcome home.- Look what you did to my head.
- You should have moved.William, will you dance with me?Of course I will.I've come to claim the right
of ""primae noctis"".As lord of these lands, I will bless this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed......on the first night of her union.By God you will not!It is my noble right.Good evening, sir.Ah, young Wallace.
A grand soft evening, huh?Aye, it's that.Might I have a word with your daughter?What do you want to have
a word with her about?Well, erm...Murron?Would you like to ride with me this evening?In this? You're out of your mind!It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling almost straight down.- She cannae go with you.
- No?No. No the now, anyway.- No the now.
- No the now.- We'll see ye later.
- The weather's fine. It's hardly raining.Did you no hear what I said?- Murron!
- Murron!It's you she takes after.How did you know me after so long?I didn't.I saw you staring at me
and I didn't know who you were.I'm sorry. I suppose I was.Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?It was the best way to make you leave.If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,
I'll warn you in writing first.- It wouldn't help. I can't read.
- Can ye not?No.Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy.- You're gonna teach me to read?
- If you like.Aye.In what language?You're showing off now.- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Should I be?Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.- My kilt'll fly up, but I'll try...You learnt no manners on your travels!The French and the Romans
are worse than I.- You went to Rome?
- Aye. Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.What was it like?What does that mean?Beautiful.But I belong here.Murron!Come in now!Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night, but...MacClannough's daughter is another matter.- I've come to fetch you to a meeting.
- What kind of meeting?- The secret kind.
- Your meetings are a waste of time.Your father was a fighter......and a patriot.I know who my father was.I came home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.If I can live in peace, I will.Go on!- You want to stay out of the troubles?
- Aye.If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.Until you prove it, the answer is no.- No.
- No, Wallace. No.Didn't I just prove it?No!- No?
- No!Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.But that will all change when my sons arrive.So, you've got children.Well, not yet. But I was hoping
that you could help me with that.So you want me to marry you, then?Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.Is that what you call a proposal?I love you. Always have.I want to marry you.Is that a yes?- Aye, that's a yes.
- Yeah?- We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting.
- Oh, wait.Where are you going?- What's that?
- You'll see.Father.I will love you my whole life.You and no other.And I you.You and no other... for ever.<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...</i>When will I see ye again? Tonight?- I can't.
- Why not?My dad's growing suspicious.Would that have anything to do with...When?When?- Tonight.
- Tonight?Look lively, Sergeant.What are you carrying, lassie?- That looks heavy. Can we help you?
- That's fine.I'm not going to steal it...Ohh! You remind me
of my daughter back home.Hello, lassie.Ssh.Keep quiet, Smythe.Aagh! Bitch!You bitch!Are you all right?- Are you all right?
- Aye.- Can you ride?
- Aye.Come back here, you bastard!Ring the alarm! Help!Meet me at the grove.- Ride!
- They're getting away!All right, you bitch!Murron!Murron!All of you know full well
the great pains I've always taken......never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the application of our laws.And, as a consequence......have we not learned to live together......in relative peace and harmony?Huh?And this... day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency.Well, you leave me with little choice.An assault on the King's soldiers......is the same as an assault
on the King himself.Now......let this scrapper come to me.There.Aaagh!Aaagh!Corporal! Some archers on the tower! Now!- Hold still, Father.You idiot, boy!Aaagh!- Father, are you all right?
- Aye.MacCaulich.MacCaulich.MacCaulich!MacCaulich! MacCaulich!MacCaulich!Wallace! Wallace!<i>Anima eius
et animae omnium fidelium defunctorum...</i><i>...per misericordiam Dei...</i><i>...requiescant in pace.</i><i>In nomine Patris, et Filii...</i><i>...et Spiritus Sanctus.</i>- Amen.
- Amen.What are you waiting for, boy?Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.Pour it straight in the wound, boy.I know it seems like
a waste of good whisky. Indulge me.Hold him! Hold him! Hold him. Now......let him go.All right?That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.- There's somebody coming!
- Arm yourselves!There's somebody coming.MacGregors! From the next glen.We heard about what was happening.We don't want you ""amerdans""
thinking you can have your fun without us.Go home.Some of us are in this.I can't help that now.But you can help yourselves. Go home.We'll have no homes left when the English
garrison comes through and burns us out.- And they will.
- Aye.Welcome.Patrol returning, my Lord.So, what news?I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.
They will be returning now!Were they dressed like this?Actually, it was more like 50.Make it quick.Do you remember me?I never did her any harm. It was my right!Your right.
I'm here to claim the right of a husband!I'm William Wallace.And the rest of you will be spared.Go back to England!And tell them there......that Scotland's daughters and her sons
are yours no more.Tell them Scotland is free.Burn it.The Scottish rebels
have routed one of my garrisons......and murdered the noble Lord.I heard.
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.And how would you deal with this... brigand?Like any common thief. Have the local
magistrate arrest and punish him.Leave us.Wallace has already killed the magistrate
and taken control of the town.Stand up.Stand up!In the morning......I depart for France to press our rights there.And I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.Understood? Is it?One day you will be a king.At least try to act like one.Get away from me!Convene my military council!There!After them!No point resisting.
You're outnumbered and trapped.Where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?- Father.
- Ah, come in. Come in.A rebellion has begun.Under whom?A commoner... named William Wallace.You will embrace this rebellion.Support it from our lands in the North.I will gain English favour by condemning it......and ordering it opposed
from our lands in the South.Sit down. Stay awhile.This Wallace...He doesn't even have a knighthood.But he fights with passion.And he inspires!And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did, eh?- So would I.
- Well, maybe it's time.It is time... to survive.You're the 17th Robert Bruce.The 16 before you passed you land and title
because they ""didn't"" charge in.- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.Rightly so! They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish, as we are.You admire this man... this William Wallace.Uncompromising men are easier to admire.He has courage. So does a dog.But it is exactly the ability to compromise
that makes a man noble.And understand this:Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king
ever to sit on the throne of England.And none of us......and nothing of Scotland will remain......unless ""we"" are as ruthless.Give ear to our nobles.Knowing their minds......is the key to the throne.Wait. Wait! Look.This is out, and this is left.Carry on.Carry on!You know......eventually Longshanks
will send in his northern army.Heavy cavalry. Armoured horse.
Shake the very ground.He'll ride right over us.Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.- So what do we do?
- Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.Or make spears.Hundreds of 'em.
Long spears. Twice as long as a man.- That long?
- Aye.Some men are longer than others.Your mother been telling you
stories about me again, eh?Volunteers coming in!William Wallace.
We've come to fight and to die for you.Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.- I brought you this...
- We checked them for arms.I brought you this.My wife made it for you.Ah, thank you.Him! That can't be William Wallace.I'm prettier than this man.All right, Father.I'll ask him.If I risk my neck for you......will I get to kill Englishmen?Is your father a ghost
or do you converse with the Almighty?To find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.Yes, Father!The Almighty says,
""Just answer the fucking question!""- Mind your tongue.
- Insane Irish!Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.That's my friend, Irishman.And the answer to your question is yes.
Fight for me, you get to kill the English.Excellent!Stephen is my name.I'm the most wanted man on my island.Except I'm not on my island, of course.- More's the pity.
- Your island?- You mean Ireland?
- Yeah. It's mine.You're a madman.I've come to the right place, then.Sure, didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?I didn't like him anyway.He wasn't right in the head.William! It's our runners!The English... are advancing
an army towards Stirling!- Do the nobles rally?
- Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.But word has spread. The Highlanders
are coming down on their own.Aye... In droves of hundreds...
and thousands!Are you ready for a war?!- What news?
- We're outnumbered, at least three to one.- How many horse, then?
- 300, maybe more.- 300 heavy horse!
- We must ""try"" to negotiate.Who was in command?
Did he have a scarlet chevron?- Aye, he did.
- That'll be Cheltham.We could still negotiate...What are they talking about?I cannae hear, but it doesnae look good.The nobles will negotiate.They do a deal... and we go home.If not... we charge.300 heavy horse! We've no chance!So many.I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.Then I'd have to work for them.Nor me.All right, lads!I'm not dying for these bastards!Let's go home!Stop, men!Do not flee! Wait until we've negotiated!William Wallace!Can't be. Not tall enough.The Almighty says this is a fashionable fight.
It's drawn the finest people.- Where is thy salute?
- For coming to this battlefield, I thank you.This is our army.
To join it, you give homage.I give homage to Scotland.And if this is your army......why does it go?We didn't come here to fight for them!Home! The English are too many!Sons of Scotland!I am William Wallace!- William Wallace is seven feet tall.
- Yes, I've heard.He kills men by the hundred.And if he were here, he'd consume
the English with fireballs from his eyes......and lightning from his arse!I ""am"" William Wallace!And I see......a whole army of my countrymen......here in defiance of tyranny.You've come to fight as free men......and free men you are!What will you do without freedom?Will you fight?Against that? No!We will run, and we will live.Aye. Fight and you may die.Run, and you'll live.At least a while.And dying in your beds,
many years from now......would you be willing to trade......all the days from this day to that......for one chance, just one chance......to come back here and tell our enemies......that they may take our lives......but they'll never take our freedom!<i>Alba qu bra!</i><i>Alba qu bra!</i>They seem quite optimistic.
Maybe they do want to fight.Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion.But nonetheless...
I think we should deliver the King's terms.The King's terms?
They'll never live up to them.My Lord, I think...All right! Offer them the terms.- They're coming out. Should we go to them?
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?Aye.Fine speech.Now what do we do?Just be yourselves.Where are you going?I'm going to pick a fight.Well... we didn't get dressed up for nothing.Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.Here are the King's terms.Lead this army off the field......and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire......including hereditary title,
from which you will pay...- From which you will pay...
- I have an offer for ye.Cheltham, this is William Wallace.From which you will pay the King
an annual duty...- I said I have an offer for ""you"".
- You disrespect a banner of truce!From his King? Absolutely.Here are Scotland's terms.Lower your flags...
and march straight back to England.At every home you pass, beg forgiveness
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.Do that, and your men shall live.Do it not...
and every one of you will die today.You are outmatched.
You have no heavy cavalry.In two centuries, no army has won without...I'm not finished!Before we let you leave......your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army......put his head between his legs...
and kiss his own arse.I'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.You be ready and do exactly as I say.
On my signal......ride round behind our position,
and flank them.- We must not divide our forces.
- Do it... and let the English see you do it.They'll think we run away?Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.Right. Come on.<i>Ego vos absolvo...</i><i>...ab omnibus peccatis vestris.
In nomine Patris...</i>Insolent bastard!
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate!Archers!Archers forward!You bastards!The Lord tells me
He can get me out of this mess......but He's pretty sure you're fucked.Ready... Loose!Ride!See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.
Send the horse.Full attack.Steady...Hold!Hold!Hold!Hold!Now!- Send the infantry.
- My Lord...You lead them!Charge!Retreat!Bastard!Come on!All right.Wallace!Wallace! Wallace!I knight thee......Sir William Wallace.Sir William, in the name of God......we appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland......and thy captains as aides-de-camp.Stand and be recognised.Does anyone know his politics?No, but his weight with the commoners
could upset everything.The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.Sir William!Sir William.Inasmuch as you and your captains
hail from a region......long known to support the Balliol clan......may we invite you to continue your support
and uphold our rightful claim?Damn the Balliol clan!
They're all Longshanks's men!Gentlemen.- Gentlemen!
- It's time to declare a king.Halt! Wait! Are you prepared
to recognise ""our"" legitimate succession?- You won't support the claim.
- Those were lies, written by you.- Oh, no.- I demand recognition of these documents!
- These were lies when you wrote them!Please, gentlemen!Quiet! Sir William! Where are you going?We have beaten the English.But they'll come back......because you won't stand together.What will you do?I will invade England...
and defeat the English on their own ground.Invade? That's impossible.Why? Why is that impossible?You're so concerned with squabbling
for scraps from Longshanks's table......that you've missed
your God-given right to something better.There's a difference between us.You think the people of Scotland exist
to provide you with position.I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom.And I go to make sure that they have it.Wait!I respect what you said.But remember that these men
have lands and castles.It's much to risk.And the common man that bleeds
in battle, does he risk less?No.But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.Its nobles share allegiance with England.- Its clans war with each other.
- Aye.If you make enemies on both sides
of the border... you'll end up dead.We all will. It's just
a question of how and why.I'm not a coward. I want what you want.But we need the nobles.- We need 'em?
- Aye.Now, tell me.
What does that mean, to be noble?Your title gives you claim to Scotland's
throne, but men don't follow titles.They follow courage.Now, our people know you.Noble and common, they respect you.And if you would just lead them to freedom......they'd follow you.And so would I.Damn it! My sodomite cousin the Prince
tells me he has no troops to lend.And every town in northern England
is begging for help.He advances!- To which town?
- To here, my Lord.Bring the provisions inside,
double the guards, seal the gate. Now!Quickly! Bring in the provisions!Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.I will not tell my uncle I've lost him
the greatest city in the North.Come on!Make way for the King!It's not your fault.- Stand up to him!
- I will stand up to him and more.What news of the North?Nothing new, Your Majesty.
We've sent riders to speed any word.I heard the word in France where I was
fighting to expand your future kingdom.The word, my son, is that
our entire northern army is annihilated.And you have done nothing.I... I have ordered conscription, sir,
assembled and ready to depart.Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.Come.- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.Erm... W... Wallace has sacked York.What?Wallace has sacked York.Uh!Oh!Sire... thy own nephew!What beast could do such a thing!If he can sack York......he can invade Lower England.We will stop him!Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?I have declared Phillip my High Counsellor.Is he qualified?I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.Are you?Tell me...What advice would you offer
on the, er, present... situation?Aaaagh!I shall offer a truce......and buy him off.But who will go to him? Not I.If I fell under the sword of that murderer......it might be ""my"" head in a basket.And not... my gentle son.The mere sight of him would only encourage
an enemy to take over the whole country.So whom do I send?Whom do I send?I'm dreaming.Yes, you are.And you must wake.I don't want to wake.I want to stay here with you.And I with you.But you must wake now.Wake up, William.Wake up.William, wake up...William! A royal entourage comes......flying banners of truce......and the standards of Longshanks himself!I am the Princess of Wales.I come as the King's servant
and with his authority.To do what?To discuss the King's proposals.Will you speak with a woman?I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.I have been given nothing.God makes men what they are.Did God make you
the sacker of peaceful cities?The executioner of the King's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country.That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even
women and children, from the city walls.Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.You ask your King...
to his face. Ask him.See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.Hamilton... Leave us.- My Lady?
- Leave us! Now.Let us talk plainly.You invade England.But you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.The King desires peace.Longshanks desires peace?He declares it to me, I swear it.He proposes that you withdraw your attack.In return he grants you title,
estates and this chest of gold......which I am to pay to you personally.A lordship and titles, gold...
that I should become Judas.Peace is made in such ways.Slaves are made in such ways!The last time Longshanks spoke of peace,
I was a boy.And many Scottish nobles
who would not be slaves......were lured by him,
under a flag of truce, to a barn......where he had them hanged.I was very young.But I remember
Longshanks's notion of peace.I understand you have suffered.I know... about your woman.She was my wife.We married in secret because I would
not share her with an English lord.They killed her... to get to me.I've never spoken of it.I don't know why I tell you now, except......I see her strength in you.One day......you'll be a queen.And you must open your eyes.You tell your King......that William Wallace will not be ruled......and nor will any Scot while I live.Ah! My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.So he accepted our bribe?No. He did not.Then why does he stay?My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.He waits for you at York.He says he will attack no more towns......if you are man enough
to come and face him.Did he?The Welsh bowmen will not be detected......arriving so far around his flank.The main force of our armies
from France land here......to the north of Edinburgh.Conscripts from Ireland
approach from the southwest......to here.Welsh bowmen, troops from France,
Irish conscripts.But they'd take weeks to assemble.I dispatched them......before I sent your wife.So our little ruse succeeded.Thank you.And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York......my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh, behind him.You spoke with this, er......Wallace in private?Tell me...What kind of man is he?A mindless barbarian.Not a king like you, my Lord.You may return to your embroidery.Humbly, my Lord.You brought back the money, of course?No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.That's what happens
when you send a woman.Forgive me, sire. I thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness......to those you mean to rule.My greatness......will be better demonstrated
when Wallace returns to Scotland......and finds his country in ashes.William!There's riders approaching.A personal escort of the Princess.Aye.Must have made an impression.Aye.I didn't think you were in the tent that long.<i>Mademoiselle.</i><i>Un message de ma maÃ®tresse.</i><i>Merci.</i>It's true! The English ships
are moving up from the South.I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed.I had to see it myself to believe it.What are the Irish doing
fighting with the English?I wouldn't worry about them.
Didn't I tell you before?It's ""my"" island.Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council. Order it!Right. Come on!Ya!- Your island?
- My island! Yup!- We'll have to negotiate.
- Please, gentlemen!Lords, Craig is right!This time our only option is to negotiate.Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...My army has marched
for more days than I can remember.And we still have preparations to make......so I'll make this plain.We require every soldier you can summon......your personal escorts, even yourselves.And we need them now.With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.Other options?!Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field......and barter a better deal with Longshanks......before you run?
- Sir William...- We cannot defeat them!
- We can!- Sir William!
- And we will!We won at Stirling, and still you quibble!We won at York
and you would not support us.If you'll no stand up with us now,
I'd say you're cowards.If you are Scotsmen......I'm ashamed to call myself one.Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.I beg you.You've achieved
more than anyone ever dreamed.But fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.It's well beyond rage.Help me.In the name of Christ, help yourselves!Now is our chance! Now!If we join, we can win. If we win......we'll have what none of us
have ever had before.A country of our own.You're the rightful leader......and there is strength in you, I see it.Unite us.Unite us! Unite the clans!- All right!
- Right.This cannot be the way.You said yourself......the nobles will not support Wallace.So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?I gave him my word.I know it is hard.Being a leader is.My son...Son...Look at me.I cannot be King.You and you alone can rule Scotland.What I tell you, you must do.Not for me, not for yourself......but for your country.Right, lads, make way. Coming through.Make way, lads.The Bruce is not coming, William.He'll come.Mornay and Lochlan have come.So will the Bruce.Quite a lovely... gathering.Wouldn't you agree?The archers are ready, sire.Not the archers.My scouts say their archers
are miles away and no threat.Arrows cost money.Use up the Irish. The dead cost nothing.And send in the infantry and cavalry.- Infantry!
- Infantry!- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!- Advance!
- Advance!Ah, good to see ye this morning!Irish!Glad to have ye with us.Watch this.Mornay? Lochlan?I gave Mornay
double his lands in Scotland......and matching estates in England.Lochlan turned... for much less.Archers.I beg your pardon, sire?
Won't we hit our own troops?Yes.But we'll hit theirs as well.We have reserves.Attack!Archers!- Archers!
- Archers!Send in our reinforcements.- Send in the rest!Bring me Wallace.Alive, if possible.Dead... just as good.Send us news of our victory.Shall we retire?Ya! Ya!Protect the King.Aaaagh!Aagh! Aagh!Get up! Get up!Get up! Get up!- Get him out of here!
- Jesus!Go!Ya!I'm dying.Let me be.No.You're going to live.I've lived long enough to live free.Proud......to see you become the man you are.I'm a happy man.I'm the one who's rotting.But I think your face looks graver than mine.Son...We must have alliance
with England to prevail here.You achieved that.You saved your family......and increased your land.In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.Lands.Titles. Men.Power. Nothing.- Nothing?
- I have nothing.Men fight for me because if they do not
I throw them off my land......and I starve their wives and children.Those men......who bled the ground red at Falkirk...They fought for William Wallace,
and he fights......for something that I've never had.And I took it from him when I betrayed him......and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield.And it's tearing me apart.Well, all men betray. All lose heart.I don't want to lose heart!I want to believe......as he does.I will never be on the wrong side again.Aagh!No!Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?Aye.Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.More of a liability now than ever he was.And there's no telling who'll be next.Maybe you.Maybe me.It doesn't matter.I'm serious, Robert.So am I!Christ! Shit!Search the place!Lochlan!William Wallace killed 50 men.50 if it was one.100 men... with his own sword.Cut through them like......Moses through the Red Sea.His legend grows.It will be worse than before.He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town.When he replenishes his numbers...They're sheep! Mere sheep!Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.Very well.Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.My Lord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct......he warmed to our future Queen
and would trust her.So we'll dispatch her
with the notion that she comes in peace.My Lord,
the Princess might be taken hostage......or her life be put in jeopardy.My son would be most distressed by that.But in truth if she were to be killed......we would soon find the King of France
a useful ally against the Scots.You see...As King, you must find
the good in any situation.It's William Wallace, sure.And he's given up his sword.Be ready.Aagh!My Lady.I received your message.This is... the second time
you've warned me of danger.Why?There will be a new shipment
of supplies coming north next month.Foods and weapons. They will...No, stop.Why do you help me?Why do you help me?Because of the way
you are looking at me now.Just when we thought all hope was lost......our noble saviours have arrived.Off with their hoods.Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.Well, what's the point?You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.An oath to a liar is no oath at all.Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.So let the council swear publicly.We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.So we bid you to Edinburgh.Meet us two days from now. Pledge us
your pardon and we'll unite behind you.- Scotland will be one.
- One?- You mean us and you.
- No.I mean this.It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.You do know it's a trap. Tell him!If the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it at Falkirk.Aye.I know. I saw.All right, leaving him aside,
what about the others?Scheming bastards who couldnae agree on
the colour of shite! It's a trap! Are you blind?Look at us.We've got to try.We can't do this alone. Joining the nobles
is the only hope for our people.- You know what happens if we don't?
- What?Nothing.- I don't want to be a martyr.
- Nor I.I want to live.I want a home, and children. And peace.- Do ye?
- Aye, I do.I've asked God for those things.
It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.- It's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...Well, then,
what have we been doing all this time?We've lived that dream.Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron!You're doing this to be a hero
because you think she sees ye!I don't think she sees me. I know she does.And your father sees you, too.Jesus.Shall I come with you?No. I'll go alone.I'll see you after.Right.Sooner rather than later, I hope.- He won't come.
- He will.I know he will.My Lord! He approaches!No!Stay out of it, Robert!Aagh! Get away! Get away!The Bruce is not to be harmed,
that's the arrangement.Father!You rotting bastard!Why? Why?Longshanks required Wallace.So did our nobles.That was the price of your crown.Die!I want you to die.Soon enough I'll be dead.And you'll be King.I don't want anything from you!You're not a man!And you're not my father.You're my son......and you have always known my mind.You deceived me.You let yourself be deceived.In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.At last......you know what it means to hate.Now you're ready to be a king.My hate......will die with you.William Wallace,
you stand in taint of high treason.Against whom?Against your King.Have you anything to say?Never in my whole life......did I swear allegiance to him.It matters not. He is your King.Confess and you may receive a quick death.Deny and you must be purified by pain.Do you confess?Do you confess?Then on the morrow
you shall receive your purification.- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.- The King ordered that nobody...
- The King will die soon and his son is weak.Who do you think will rule this kingdom?Now open this door.Your Majesty.Come on, filth. Up on your feet!Stop it! Leave me.I said leave me!My Lady.Sir...I come to beg you......to confess all and swear allegiance
to the King that he might show you mercy.Will he show mercy to my country?Mercy is to die quickly......perhaps even live in a tower.In time, who knows what can happen?If you can only live...If I swear to him......then all that I am is dead already.You will die. It will be awful.Every man dies.Not every man really lives.Drink this.It will dull your pain.No. It will numb my wits.And I must have them all.For if I'm senseless or if I wail......then Longshanks will have broken me.I can't bear the thought of your torture.Take it.All right.I have come......to beg for the life of William Wallace.You're quite taken with him, aren't you?I respect him.At worst, he was a worthy enemy.Show mercy, O thou great King,
and win the respect of your own people.Even now......you are incapable of mercy.And you...To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.Before he lost his powers of speech......he told me his one comfort......was that he would live
to know Wallace was dead.You see?Death comes to us all.But before it comes to you......know this:Your blood dies with you.A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.I'm so afraid.Give me the strength......to die well.Boo!Here he comes!Now behold the awful price of treason!Or fall to your knees now......declare yourself the King's loyal subject......and beg his mercy......and you shall have it.Rope!- Raise him.Stretch him!That's it.Stretch him!Pleasant, yes?Rise to your knees.Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak......and you will feel no more.Rack him!Enough?It can all end......right now.Peace.Bliss.Just say it.Cry out......""Mercy"".Mercy!Mercy! Mercy!Cry out.Just say it. ""Mercy"".Mercy, William. Mercy.Jesus, man, say it.The prisoner wishes to say a word.Freedom!<i>After the beheading...</i><i>...William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.</i><i>His head was set on London Bridge.</i><i>His arms and legs...</i><i>...sent to the four corners of Britain...</i><i>...as a warning.</i><i>It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.</i><i>And I, Robert the Bruce...</i><i>...rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English King...</i><i>...and accept his endorsement of my crown.</i>I hope you've washed your arse this morning.It's about to be kissed by a king.Come. Let's get it over with.Stop!You have bled with Wallace!Now bleed with me.Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!<i>In the year of our Lord 1314...</i><i>...patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered...</i><i>...charged the fields of Bannockburn.</i><i>They fought like warrior poets.</i><i>They fought like Scotsmen...</i><i>...and won their freedom.</i>"

the Carnegie Scholarship.No, he wants it all for himself.It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.He has his sights set on
Wheeler Lab, MIT's military think-tank.They're only taking one this year.Hansen's used to being picked first.Yeah, he's wasted on math.He should be running for president.There could be a mathematical
explanation for how bad your tie is.Thank you.Neilson, symbol cryptography.Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.At least that's what he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?The name's Bender. Atomic physics.- And you are?
- Am I late?- Yes, Mr. Sol.
- Oh, good. Hi.- Sol. Richard Sol.
- The burden of genius.- There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?- Bender.
- Nice to see you.- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Thank you.I'll take another.Excuse me?Pardon me. I assumed you were the waiter.- Play nice.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.Honest mistake.Well, Martin Hansen.It is Martin, isn't it?Why, yes, John, it is.I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.I've read your preprints......both of them.The one on Nazi ciphers......and the other one
on nonlinear equations......and I am supremely confident
that there is not a single seminal......or innovative idea
in either one of them.Enjoy your punch.Gentlemen, meet John Nash......the mysterious West Virginia genius.The other winner
of the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.- Okay.
- Yeah?Of course.Oh, Christ.The prodigal roommate arrives.Roommate?Oh, God, no.Did you know that having a hangover......is not having enough water
in your body......to run your Krebs cycle?Which is exactly what happens to you
when you're dying of thirst.So, dying of thirst......would probably feel......pretty much like the hangover
that finally bloody kills you.John Nash?Hello.Charles Herman.Pleased to meet you.All right! Well done!Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.
His name was Johnny Walker.Whew.Well, I got in last night
in time for......English department cocktails.Cock was mine......the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion for......D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily distracted, are you?- I'm here to work.
- Are you? Right.I see. Crikey!Is my roommate a dick?Hmm?Listen.If we can't break the ice......how about we drown it?So what's your story?You the poor kid that never got to go
to Exeter or Andover?Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm well-balanced.I have a chip on both shoulders.Maybe you're just better with the old
integers than you are with people.My first grade teacher said
I was born with two helpings of brain......but only half a helping of heart.Wow! She sounds lovely!The truth is that I...I don't like people much.And they don't much like me.But why,
with all your obvious wit and charm?Seriously, John.Mathematics...Mathematics is never going to lead you
to a higher truth.And you know why?Because it's boring. It's really boring.You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?I cannot waste time
with these classes and......these books.Memorizing the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!I need to look through......to the governing dynamics.Find a truly original idea.That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.- It's the only way that I'll ever...

Sol does his laundry all semester.- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
- Not at all.- Look at him.
- Nash!Taking a reverse constitutional?I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.Oh.Psycho.I thought you dropped out.
You ever going to go to class or...Classes will dull your mind.Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.Oh, I didn't know that.Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.Which is another way of saying
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.You scared?Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.Stupefied by you.No starch.Pressed and folded.Let me ask you something, John.Be my guest, Martin.Bender and Sol here correctly completed
Allen's proof of Peronâs conjectures.Adequate work......without innovation.- I'm flattered. You flattered?
- Flattered.And I've got two weapons briefs
under security review by the DOD.Derivative drivel.But Nash achievements: zero.I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?What if you never come up

you've invented window art.This is a group playing touch football.This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over breadcrumbs.And this is a woman who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.John, you watched a mugging.That's weird.In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.See, if I could derive an equilibrium......where prevalence is
a non-singular event......where nobody loses.Imagine the effect that would have
on conflict scenarios...When did you last eat?- When did you last eat?
- Currency exchange?You know, food.You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know?Yes. But pizza...Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.And, of course, beer.I have respect for beer.I have respect for beer!- Good evening, Neils.
- Hey, Nash.Who's winning? You or you?- Good evening, Nash.
- Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.He's looking at you for sure.Hey, Nash.Neils is trying to get your attention.- You're joking.
- Oh, no.- Go with God.
- Come back a man.- Fortune favors the brave.
- Bombs away.Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success......dramatically improve
with each attempt?This is going to be classic.Maybe you want to buy me a drink.I don't know what I'm required to say......in order for you
to have intercourse with me......but could we assume
that I've said all that?Essentially we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?So, could we just go
straight to the sex?Oh, that was sweet.Have a nice night, asshole!Ladies, wait!I especially liked the bit
about fluid exchange. It was......really charming.Walk with me, John.I've been meaning to talk with you.The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.We're deciding
which placement applications to support.Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.Actually, I don't really have
a second choice, sir.Your fellows have attended classes.
They've written papers.
They've published.I'm still searching, sir, for my...- Your original idea.
- Governing dynamics, sir.It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid
it's just not nearly good enough.- May I?
- Thank you.I'm working on manifold embedding.My bargaining stratagems
show some promise.If you could just arrange another
meeting with Professor Einstein.I've repeatedly asked you for that.I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...John.Do you see what they're doing there?Congratulations, Professor Max.Thank you, sir. Thank you.It's the pens.Reserved for a member of the department
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.Now what do you see, John?Recognition.Well done, Professor.Well, try seeing accomplishment.Is there a difference?You haven't focused.I'm sorry, but up to this
point, your record doesn't
warrant any placement at all.Good day.And my compliments to you, sir.Thank you so much.I can't see it.Jesus Christ, John.I can't fail.- This is all I am.
- Come on, let's go out.- I have to get something done.
- John!- I can't keep staring into space.
- John, enough!Got to face the wall,
follow their rules, read their books......do their classes.Come on! Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.Don't do it. Don't mess around.Bust your head! Go on,
bust that worthless head wide open.Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?It's not my problem.And it's not your problem.It's their problem.Your answer isn't, ""face the wall.""It's out there......where you've been working.That was heavy.That Isaac Newton fellow was right.- He was onto something.
- Clever boy.Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.Oh, God.- Incoming, gentlemen.
- Ay-yi-yi.Deep breaths.Nash, you might want to stop
shuffling your papers for five seconds.I will not buy you gentlemen beer.We're not here for beer, my friend.Oh.Does anyone else feel
she should be moving in slow motion?Will she want a large wedding, you think?Shall we say swords? Pistols at dawn?Have you remembered nothing?Recall the lessons of Adam Smith......the father of modern economics.""In competition...""...individual ambition
serves the common good.""Every man for himself, gentlemen.Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.I'm not going to strike out.You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.Nobody move.She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.Oh, God. He may have the upper hand now......but wait until he opens his mouth.Remember the last time?That was one for the history books.- Adam Smith needs revision.
- What are you talking about?If we all go for the blonde......we block each other.Not a single one of
us is going to get her.So then we go for her friends......but they will all give
us the cold shoulder because
nobody likes to be second choice.Well, what if no one goes for the blonde?We don't get in each other's way......and we don't insult the other girls.That's the only way we win.That's the only way we all get laid.Adam Smith said:""The best result comes...""...from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself.""Right. Incomplete. Okay?Because the best result will come......from everyone in the group......doing what's best for himself......and the group.If this is some way for you
to get the blonde, go to hell.Governing dynamics. Adam Smith......was wrong.- Here we go.
- Careful, careful.Thank you.""C"" of ""S"" equals ""C"" of ""T.""You do realize this flies in the face
of 150 years of economic theory?Yes, I do, sir.- That's rather presumptuous, no?
- It is, sir.Well, Mr. Nash......with a breakthrough of this magnitude......I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.Wheeler Labs......they'll ask you to recommend
two team members.Stills and Frank are excellent choices.Sol and Bender, sir.Sol and Bender
are extraordinary mathematicians.Has it occurred to you that Sol and
Bender might have plans of their own?We made it!Wheeler, we made it!Cheers, cheers, cheers!Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.Umm...Governing dynamics.Congratulations, John.- Toast! To Wheeler Labs!
- To Wheeler!General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.Dr. Nash, your coat?Thank you, sir.General, this is Wheeler team leader,
Dr. John Nash.- Glad you could come, Doctor.
- Hello.Right this way.We've been intercepting
radio transmissions from Moscow.The computer can't detect a pattern,
but I'm sure it's code.Why is that, General?Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?Constantly.We've developed several ciphers.If you'd like to review
our preliminary data?- Doctor?
- 6-7-3-7.0- 3-6...8- 4-9-4.9- 1-4-0-3-4.I need a map.46-13-08, 67-46-90.Starkey Corners, Maine.48-03-01.91-26-35.Prairie Portage, Minnesota.These are latitudes and longitudes.There are at least 10 others.They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.Extraordinary.Gentlemen, we need to move on this.- Who's Big Brother?
- You've done your
country a great service.- Captain!
- Yes, sir.Accompany Dr. Nash.What are the Russians moving, General?Captain Rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.Thank you.Dr. Nash, follow me, please.None of those
who said they don't like the method......have told us any other method
they could use that would be effective.- It's Dr. Nash.
- All right.- Thank you, sir.
- Home run at the Pentagon?Have they actually taken the word
""classified"" out of the dictionary?Hi. The air conditioning broke again.How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?Our hearts go out to you.Two trips to the Pentagon in four years.- That's two more than we've had.
- It gets better.Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,
the Nazis are repatriating South America......the Chinese have a standing army
of 2.8 million......and I am doing stress tests on a dam.You made the cover of Fortune again.Please note the use of the word ""you,""
not ""we.""That was supposed to be just me.Not only do they rob me
of the Fields' Medal......they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine with these hacks......these scholars of trivia.Exactly what's the difference
between genius and most genius?Quite a lot.He's your son.
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.- I've always got 10 minutes.
- Before your new class?Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?You are a doctor, John, and no.You know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities......MIT gets America's great
minds of today, teaching their
great minds of tomorrow.- Poor bastards.
- Now, have a nice day at school.The bell is ringing.The eager young minds of tomorrow.Can we leave one open,
Professor? It's really hot, sir.Your comfort comes second
to my ability to hear my own voice.Personally......I think this class will be
a waste of your......and what is infinitely worse......my time.However, here we are.So you may attend or not.You may complete your assignments
at your whim.We have begun.Miss.Excuse me!- Excuse me!
- Hey, hey!Hi!We have a little problem.It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed.......and extremely noisy with them open.I was wondering
if there was any way you could......I don't know, maybe work
someplace else for about 45 minutes?- Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!- Break!
- Got it!Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.As you will find in multivariable
calculus, there is often......a number of solutions
for any given problem.As I was saying, this problem here......will take some of you
many months to solve.For others among you......it will take you the term
of your natural lives.Professor Nash.William Parcher.Big Brother......at your service.What can I do
for the Department of Defense?- Are you here to give me a raise?
- Let's take a walk.- Impressive work at the Pentagon.
- Yes, it was.Oppenheimer used to say, ""A genius
sees the answer before the question.""You knew Oppenheimer?His project was under my supervision.Which project?- That project.
- It's not that simple.Well, you ended the war.We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.Great deeds come at great cost,
Mr. Parcher.Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury
of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.I'll try and keep that in mind.So, John, no family......no close friends.- Why is that?
- I like to think it's
because I'm a Ione wolf.But mainly it's because
people don't like me.There are certain endeavors......where your lack of personal connection
would be considered an advantage.- This is a secure area.
- They know me.Have you ever been here?We were told in our initial
briefing these warehouses were abandoned.That's not precisely accurate.By telling you this......I am increasing your security
clearance to top secret.Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.Get it?What operation?Those are a good idea.This factory is in Berlin,
we seized it at the end of the war.Nazi engineers were attempting to build
a portable atomic bomb.The Soviets reached this facility before
we did, and we lost the damn thing.The routing orders at the Pentagon.They were about this, weren't they?The Soviets aren't as unified
as people believe.A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svoboda......the ""New Freedom,""
has control of the bomb......and intends to detonate
it on U.S. soil.Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.Man is capable of as
much atrocity as he has imagination.New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.New Freedom communicates
to its agents......through codes imbedded in newspapers
and magazines......and that's where you come in.You see, John, what distinguishes you......is that you are, quite simply......the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?Commit this list of periodicals to memory.Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes, decipher them.Place your chin on the chin rest.- Stare into the light.
- Pulse 88, regular.Okay, this may be a little uncomfortable.It's got a little zap to it, doesn't it?He just implanted a radium diode.Don't worry, it's safe.The isotope decays predictably.As a result,
these numbers change over time.They're the access codes
to your drop spot.So what am I now, a spy?Come.Boy, you must be really important.It's all right, Mike.What are you working on?Classified.Everyone waited half an hour.- For?
- Class.You missed class today.Oh. I suspect that......nobody missed me.The problem that you left on the board......I solved it.- No, you didn't.
- You didn't even look.I never said that the vector fields
were rational functions.Your solution is elegant.Though on this particular occasion......ultimately incorrect.- You're still here.
- I'm still here.Why?I'm wondering, Professor Nash......if I can ask you to dinner.You do eat, don't you?On occasion, yeah.Table for one.
Prometheus alone chained to the rock......with the bird circling overhead,
you know how it is.No, I expect that you wouldn't know...Leave your address with my office.
I'll pick you up Friday......at 8:00 and we'll eat.One more thing. Do you have a name, or
should I just keep calling you ""miss""?Governor...- ...may I present...
- Miss Alicia Larde.Professor, please. You and the governor.Wait, one second. I'm sorry.I want a copy of this.
First big date and all, you know.So, you boys need to look good......which is not a state you find
yourselves in altogether naturally.There. Better.- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.Professor.God must be a painter.Why else would we have so many colors?So you're a painter?That's not actually what I said......but, yes, I am.Here.Me.Your date.Practice human interaction
and social comportment.That's a plan.Champagne would be lovely.I'll be outside.I will get the champagne.Oh, thank you.Thank you for that.No, keep it.I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.- Do you?
- No.I don't believe in luck.But I do believe
in assigning value to things.Oh.I once tried to count them all.I actually made it to 4,348.You are exceptionally odd.I bet you're very popular with the girls.A pair of odd ducks, then.Mmm.Pick a shape.What?Pick a shape, an animal, anything.Okay.An umbrella.Do it again.Do it again.- All right. What would you like?
- Do an octopus.You don't talk much, do you?I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.I don't mean work.I find that polishing my interactions......in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.I have a tendency
to expedite information flow......by being direct.- I often don't get a pleasant result.
- Try me.All right.I find you attractive.Your aggressive moves towards me
indicate that you feel the same way.But still, ritual requires
that we continue with a
number of platonic activities......before we have sex.I am proceeding with those activities......but in point of actual fact......all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.Are you going to slap me now?How was that result?What are you doing?Trying to isolate patterned reoccurrences
within periodicals over time.And you?You talk funny, Mr. Nash.Do I know you?My uncle says you're very smart
but not very nice......so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.And who might your uncle be?The prodigal roommate......returns.Come here, Charles.My sister got herself
killed in a car crash.Not too far now, Marcee!Her cowboy husband was too drunk
to know that he was too drunk to drive.So, I took her in.- She's so small.
- She's young. That's how they come.I'm at Harvard......doing the great author's workshop.D.H. bloody Lawrence.I really do think
you should buy yourself a new book.Well, I've been reading a lot about you.How are you, John?At first, all my work here was trivial......but a new assignment came up and...I can't really tell you any details.Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?Something like that.- And...
- Yes?Well, I met a girl.- No! A human girl?
- Homo sapien.- A biped?
- Yep. And contrary to all probabilities......she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.God, that's wonderful.There's no accounting for taste, is there?- Should I marry her?
- Oh, God. Right.I mean, everything's going well.
The job is fine. I have enough money.It all seems to add up.But how do you know for sure?Nothing's ever for sure, John.That's the only sure thing I do know.Good evening.Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track of time at work...- ... Again.
- Mm-hmm.I'm sorry.I didn't have time to wrap it.Happy birthday.The refractive faces of the glass
create a full wavelength dispersal...... so if you look inside, you can see...- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.Yeah.Remember you said that time, God must
be a painter because of all the colors?At the governor's house you said that.I didn't think you were listening.I was listening.It's beautiful.Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?Because I need some kind of proof,
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.I'm sorry, just give me a moment......to redefine my girlish notions
of romance.A proof?Verifiable data.Okay.Well, how big is the universe?Infinite.How do you know?- Because all the data indicates it.
- But it hasn't been proven yet?You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?I don't, I just believe it.It's the same with love, I guess.Now......the part that you don't know......is if I want to marry you.Smile for the camera!Well done!Congratulations.You look beautiful.Hi, how are you?- Bye-bye.
- Bye, now.Be safe!Get in. Hurry.They're following us.- Who is following us?
- The drop has been compromised.Get down!Stay down.- Take this.
- I am not shooting anybody.- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!You stay back. Don't move.John?Hi.Where were you?- Sol...
- Yeah, I talked to Sol.He said you left the office hours ago.Why didn't you call me?Are you all right?Honey?John......please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.John, open the door.Come on, open the door! Let me in!Talk to me!John!Open this door!Watch for cars, kids.John.William.This is not what I signed up for.Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...I understand better
than you could possibly imagine.You need to calm down, John.Now listen. We're closing in on the bomb......in large part due to your work.Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?William, my circumstance has changed.Alicia's pregnant.I told you attachments were dangerous.You chose to marry the girl.I did nothing to prevent it.The best way to ensure
everybody's safety......is for you to continue your work.Well, I'll just quit.You won't.Why would I not?Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.You quit working for me......I quit working for you.Parcher!John, you all right?John?Turn it off! Turn off the light!Why would you do that?- Why would you turn the light on?
- What is wrong with you?You have to go to your sister's.I left the car out in back.
Take Commonwealth, no side streets.Stay where it's crowded.John, I'm not going anywhere!When you get to your sister's,
wait for my call.- Get your things.
- I'm not leaving!Stop! Stop it!Please, Alicia.I'll explain when I can.Uncle John!Uncle John!Hey, baby girl!Wow, someone needed a hug!I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself:""How can I miss seeing a guest lecture
by the inimitable John Nash?""What's wrong?I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.Now you tell me, what is it?Professor Nash!Welcome!After?So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann Zeta function......correspond to singularities......in space-time...Singularities in space-time then...And conventional number theory...It breaks down
in the face of relativistic exploration.Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.Professor Nash!- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?Professor Nash,
let's avoid a scene, shall we?What do you want?My name is Rosen.Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.I'd like you to come with me, John.Just for a chat.It appears I have no choice.Help me! Somebody!Somebody!Help me! Get off me!I know who you are!No, no, don't!Charles, they're Russians!
They're Russians!Call somebody! Call somebody!- They're Russians!
- Steady the leg.Get away from me.Stay away from me!There, now.All better.Everything's all right here.Watch your head.John?Can you hear me?Go easy now.Thorazine takes a
little while to wear off.Sorry about the restraints.You've got one hell of a right hook.Where am I?MacArthur Psychiatric Hospital.I find that highly unlikely.You made a mistake.My work is non-military in application.Which work is that, John?I don't know anything.There's no good in keeping secrets,
you know.Charles?Charles?I didn't mean to get you involved in this.I'm sorry.Charles?The prodigal roommate revealed.""Saw my name on the lecture slate""?You lying son of a bitch!Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.How do you say
""Charles Herman"" in Russian?How do you say it in Russian?There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.He's right there. He's right there.Stop! I don't know anything!Stop! I don't know anything!My name is John Nash.I'm being held against my will.Somebody call the Department of Defense.My name is John Nash.I'm being held against my will!What's wrong with him?John has schizophrenia.People with this disorder
are often paranoid.But his work.He deals with conspiracy.Yes, I know.In John's world,
these behaviors are accepted......encouraged.As such,
his illness may have gone untreated......far longer than is typical.What do you mean? How long?Possibly since graduate school.At least that's when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?One, so far, that I am aware of.An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.Charles isn't imaginary.They have been best friends
since Princeton.Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?He's always in town
for so little time, lecturing.- Was he at your wedding?
- He had to teach.Have you seen a picture,
or talked to him on the phone?This is ridiculous.I phoned Princeton.According to their housing records,
John lived alone.Now, which is more likely?
That your husband......a mathematician
with no military training......is a spy fleeing the Russians...
- You're making him sound crazy.Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?The only way I can help him,
is to show him the difference......between what is real
and what is in his mind.Come on.What's he been working on?His work is classified.He mentioned a supervisor......by the name of William Parcher.Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things for us.But I can't get to him without clearances.You want me to help you get the details
of my husband's work?John thinks I'm a Russian spy.Is that what you think?- What did the doctor say?
- Is he sick?I don't know.I want to see
what John's been working on.- You can't go in his office.
- It's classified, Alicia.Stop.Oh, my God.Oh, my God.Why didn't you say something?Alicia, John has always been......a little weird.He said he was doing code-breaking.- It was eyes-only.
- Top-secret, part of the military effort.Was he?It was possible.Directives come down all the time
that some aren't cleared for.- It was possible.
- Possible, but not likely.Lately, he'd become much more agitated,
and then when you called...So, is this all he's been doing every day?Cutting up magazines?Well, not all.- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.I missed you.I have to talk to you.Okay.Alicia, I've been thinking about it......and I do realize that my behavior......and my inability
to discuss the situation with you......must have appeared insane.I left you with no other choice.I do understand...- ...and I'm truly sorry.
- That's okay.Everything will be all right.Everything will be all right.We just have to talk quietly.They may be listening.
There may be microphones.I'll tell you everything now.It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know......because you have to help me
get out of here.I've been doing top-secret work
for the government.There's a threat that exists......of catastrophic proportions.I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.That's why they won't do away with me.They're keeping me here
to try to stop me from doing my work.You have to get to Wheeler.- You have to find William Parcher.
- Stop.Stop!I went to Wheeler.Good, good.There is no William Parcher.Of course there is.
I've been working for him.Doing what? Breaking codes?Dropping packages in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up?How could you know that?Sol followed you.- He thought it was harmless.
- Sol followed me?They've never been opened.It isn't real.There is no conspiracy, John.There is no William Parcher.It's in your mind.Do you understand, baby?You're sick.You're sick, John.John?John!Code red.Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation Room 2.Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation Room 2.John?John?The implant is gone.I can't find it.It's gone.You see, the nightmare of schizophrenia......is not knowing what's true.Imagine......if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places......and the moments most important to you
were not gone, not dead......but worse, had never been.What kind of hell would that be?Administering insulin.8:42 a.m.How often?Five times a week for 10 weeks.John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.Hansen is running the department now.So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.Yeah.John won't come near the campus, though.
I think he's ashamed.Hey. Hey.Want this?So, Alicia, how are you holding up?The delusions have passed.They're saying with the medication
and low stress environment...I mean, how are you?I think often what I feel......is obligation.Or guilt over wanting to leave.Rage against John, against God, and...But......then I look at him......and I force myself to see the man
that I married.And he becomes that man.He's transformed into someone that I love.And I'm transformed into someone
who loves him.It's not all the time, but......it's enough.I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.So unlucky.- This is us.
- This is it?It's near where I work.John? You have a visitor.Hi.I hope it's okay.Hey, chief.- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.I quit, actually.- Hello.
- Hey, John.Have you met Harvey?- There's no...
- Relax, it's okay.There's no point being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.Jesus Christ. I should have known.Here you go.- I can take those later.
- You're supposed to take them now.- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.Okay.So, I was in town giving a workshop.I go back tonight.Bender really wanted to stop by......you know, see you. Say hi.Squeamish?Yeah.I suppose I would be, too.But, alas, I'm stuck with me.I'm trying to solve the Riemann hypothesis.Uh-huh.Oh, yeah?I figured if I dazzle them......they will have to reinstate me.But it's difficult with the medication......because it's hard......to see the solution.You know, John, you should go easy.There are other things besides work.What are they?What are you thinking about?What do people do?It's life, John.Activities available, just add meaning.You could try leaving the house.You know, maybe......talk to people.You could try taking out the garbage.And there's some more,
there's some more in...Who were you talking to?Garbage man.Garbage men don't come at night.I guess around here they do.Sorry.Is it the medication?I don't know what to do.My mother's going to
keep the baby a little longer tonight.I can get three hours of overtime.I'm going to bed.- Good night.
- Good night.It's good to see you, John.It's been a while.Parcher?Yes, sir.You're not real!Of course I am. Don't be ridiculous.I don't think that I would go that way.It's time for you to get back to work.The bomb is in its final position
here in the U.S.Knowing your situation requires you
keep a low profile, ""Mohammed""......we've brought the mountain to you.We've narrowed the bomb's location
to somewhere on the eastern seaboard.But we haven't been able to pinpoint
its exact position.Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.Look at this, John.What?What?- Dr. Rosen said...
- Rosen! That quack!""Schizophrenic break from reality,""
right? Psychological bullshit!Look at me, John.John, look at me.Do I look like I'm imagined?Wheeler has no record of you.Do you think we list our personnel?I'm sorry you had to go through all this.I've gone to a great deal of trouble
to get you back.I can restore your status at Wheeler.I can let the world know what you did.But I need you now, soldier.I was so scared you weren't real.There's a storm coming.I'm just going to grab the laundry.I'll draw his bath.It's okay.Okay.John!I've almost got it!
Charles, you just watch the baby.No!I need a towel.- Charles was watching him. He was okay.
- There is no one here.There is no one here!He's been injected with a cloaking serum.I can see him because of a chemical
that was released into my bloodstream......when my implant dissolved.I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!Alicia!- No!
- Hello, I need Dr. Rosen's office, please.You've got to stop her, John.You leave her out of this.- Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.- She'll compromise us again.
- She won't.You'll go back to the hospital.- Answer me!
- Countless people will die.Alicia, please put the phone down.- I can't let that happen.
- Yes, hello?Hi, I need Dr. Rosen. Is he in?I'm sorry, John.No!- You know what you must do.
- Get away from me.- She's too great a risk.
- Get away!I didn't mean to hurt you!Finish her. She knows too much now.Uncle John?Take care of her, you pathetic
piece of shit, or I'll take care of you.Christ, John, please do what he says.Move, soldier.Now.Uncle John?John, please!Now!Alicia and Charles never
coexist in the same interactive field.Parcher and Charles...Charles and Marcee
cannot coexist with Alicia.I understand.She never gets old.Marcee can't be real. She never gets old.You see them now?Yes.Why did you stop your meds?Because I couldn't do my work.I couldn't help with the baby.I couldn't...I couldn't respond to my wife.You think that's better than being crazy?We'll need to start you on a higher run
of insulin shocks and a new medication.No.- There has to be another way.
- Schizophrenia is degenerative.Some days may be symptom-free,
but over time, you are getting worse.It's a problem. That's all it is.It's a problem with no solution.
And that's what I do, I solve problems.This isn't math.You can't come up with a formula to
change the way you experience the world.- All I have to do is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not?Because your mind is where the problem
is in the first place.I can do this.I can work it out. All I need is time.Is that the baby?The baby is at my mother's, John.Without treatment, John......the fantasies may take over......entirely.You almost ready?Rosen's waiting outside.I can't go back to that hospital.I won't come home.He said that if you said that......he has commitment papers
for me to sign.Well, maybe you won't sign them.Maybe you'll just give me some time.I will try to figure this out.Whatever you do......Rosen is right about one thing.You shouldn't be here.I'm not safe anymore.Would you have hurt me, John?I don't know.Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen
drive you to your mother's.He told me to leave.I understand.Rosen said to call if you try
and kill me, or anything.You want to know what's real?This.This.This.This is real.Maybe the part......that knows the
waking from the dream......maybe it isn't here.Maybe it's here.I need to believe......that something extraordinary
is possible.Come.Hello, Martin.Jesus Christ.No. I...I don't have that one. My savior complex
takes on a completely different form.I heard what happened and......I wanted to write,
and I tried you at MacArthur's......but you'd left, and I just...This is Helinger's old office.Yeah.Yeah, I stole it from him.Seems that you won after all, Martin.They were wrong, John. No one wins.Please, have a seat.God, it's so good to see you.What brings you back to Princeton?John?John, I'm sorry, but you have to tell him.Tell him you're a genius. You're a genius!Tell him your work is critical.
John, please!Is there any chance
that you could ignore what I just did?Of course, what are old friends for?Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?John, of course.Of course. We always have been.Alicia and I think......that fitting in,
being part of a community......might do me some good.That a certain level of attachment,
familiar places, familiar people......might help me......elbow out......these certain delusions that I have.It's a lot to ask, and
now that I'm here......I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.But I was wondering if
I could hang around.Huh.Will you be needing an office?No.No, I could just work out of the library.This guy tries to wander into
the library...- ...But he has no ID.
- Why can't people read memos?Then he goes totally nuts.You're not real! You're not real.There's no mission.Oh, shit. Shit.You're not real! You are not real!Is this what you are, soldier?
Some useless ghoul?The local madman?- I'm not a soldier.
- You'll end up in a cell!Old, worthless, discarded.There's no mission.While you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!You are not real! You are not real!You're still talking to me, soldier.There's no mission! I'm not a soldier!John? John?John! It's okay.I just heard what happened, I'm sorry.- I'm not a soldier.
- John. Hey, Nash.Nash, hey. You're all right.Nash, hey.Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!John?You should've seen their faces.Everybody was just staring at me.John, you know that stress
triggers the delusions.I know.But then, on the way home......Charles was there.Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.Maybe Rosen's right.Maybe I have to think about going back
into the hospital again.No. Come here.Maybe try again tomorrow.John, now you can't ignore me forever.You've been a very good friend to me.The best.But I won't talk to you again.I just can't.Same goes for you, baby girl.Good-bye.Good-bye.I was wondering
if I might audit your course.It's an honor, Professor Nash.Is something wrong?This will be my first class.Good morning......eager young minds.It's never going to work, John.You're just humiliating yourself.It's pathetic!You are being pathetic.I'm ashamed of you!Oh, man!Are you coming? You're going to be late.- Dad, you've got my book.
- What?- You've got my book.
- Oh, right.Thanks.- Good-bye.
- Bye.See you tonight.Bye, honey.Did you just solve Riemann?Well, what do you think?That's an analog to Frobenius
for non-commutative extensions.Yes, it is.But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.But......I believe I'm making progress.You're...You're John Nash, right?- Toby Kelly.
- Hello.I've been studying your equilibrium
that you wrote here at Princeton.To come up with something
totally original, the way you did...You know, I was young.I've been developing a theory.I believe I can prove......that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.That everything is connected.
That it's all part of the same subject.When was the last time you ate?- Excuse me?
- You know, food.Oh, uh...My wife......she loves mayonnaise.Thank you.Go on.The functor......is in the two categories.Alicia!Alicia!Coming together at a maximum speed of......let us say, 10 miles per hour.So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle ""B""......and the fly,
who can travel at 20 miles an hour......leaves the tire of ""B""
and flies to the tire of bicycle ""A""......and backwards and forwards
until the two bikes collide......and the poor little fly is squashed.This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending......the area you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific......and it is an art form, no matter
what people here will tell you......especially people from biology.
Don't listen to those people.Let me go back to what you were doing.
I might want to steal this......write a book and get famous.I was thinking that I might teach.A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.I'm an acquired taste, Martin.I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.What about the...Well, you know.Are they gone?No, they're not gone.And maybe they never will be.But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think they've given up on me.You think that's what it's like with all
our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?John, they haunt you though.They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.Well, good-bye.John, I'll talk to the department.Maybe in the spring.Hey, Nash.You, uh...You scared?Terrified.Mortified. Petrified.Stupefied by you.Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you'll get me...- I'll ring her.
...in a lot of trouble.- Thanks, Professor.
- Good-bye.- Have a nice day.
- Good-bye.Papers in hand, Mr. Bayer.Professor Nash?- Can you see him?
- Yeah.- You sure?
- Yes.Positive? He's within your vision?Okay. Good.Forgive me,
I'm just always suspicious of new people.- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.So now that I know that you're real,
who are you, and what can I do for you?Professor, my name is Thomas King.Thomas King?I'm here to tell you that you're being
considered for the Nobel Prize.Forgive me, but I'm just
a little stunned.Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone......of modern economics.Suddenly everybody likes that one.What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?The application
of your bargaining problem......to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.I never would have considered that.Have I just reached some level of
honesty that borders on stupidity?- No, you haven't.
- I wouldn't have thought of that.Shall we have tea?I don't go in there. I usually
take my sandwich in the library.Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.Most commercially available brands
of tea are not suitable to my palate.I'm not...There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough...I enjoy the flavor that they have.
I have not been in this room......for quite some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.Why, thank you, young lady.Things have certainly changed
around here. I have a son that age.Harvard.Hmm.I would have thought the nominations for
the Nobel Prize would've been secret.I would have thought you'd only
find out if you won or lost.That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.The awards are substantial.They require private funding as such......the image of the Nobel is...I see, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?Find out if I would screw
everything up if I actually won?Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken?Something like that, yes.Would I embarrass you?Yes, it is possible.You see, I...I am crazy.I take the newer medications......but I still see things
that are not here.I just choose not to acknowledge them.Like a diet of the mind, I choose
not to indulge certain appetites.Like my appetite for patterns.Perhaps my appetite to imagine
and to dream.Professor Nash.It's good to have you here, John.Thank you.- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.A privilege, Professor.Professor.- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.Thank you.Thank you.Thank you, Ed.That was certainly most unexpected.Thank you.I've always believed in numbers.In the equations and logics
that lead to reason.But after a lifetime of such pursuits......I ask, what truly is logic?Who decides reason?My quest has taken me
through the physical......the metaphysical......the delusional......and back.And I have made the most important
discovery of my career.The most important discovery of my life.It is only in the mysterious equations
of love......that any logical reasons
can be found.I'm only here tonight because of you.You are the reason I am.You are all my reasons.Thank you.So nice to have met you.I'll call for the car, Dad.- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.- Are you ready to go now?
- Yes, I am.Yes, indeed, and yes, please.Thank you so much.Thank you.What is it? What's wrong?Nothing.Nothing at all.- Come with me, young lady.
- Oh.I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?Where's it going to?"

- Loose!Stay with me!Roma victor!Do you think he's really dying?He's been dying for 10 years.If he werert really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.Maybe he just misses us.And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...Peace, Commodus.After two weeks on the road,your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.He will name me.The first thing I shall do when...Is honor him with games
won'thy of His Majesty.For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.Your Highness?We seem to be almost there, sir.- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.The wounded are still coming in.My horse.My lord.Kiss?You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.Let us hope, for the last time.There's no one left to fight, sire.There is always someone left to fight.How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?Let me go home.Home.They honor you, Caesar.It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?You have missed the war.Father, congratulations.I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.Save the bulls.Honor Maximus. He won the battle.- General.
- Highness.Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.It has been too long, my old friend.Highness.Here, Father. Take my arm.I think it is time for me to leave.So much for the glory of Rome.Magnificent battle.General. Still alive?Still alive.The gods must have a sense of humor.- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.- Here he is.
- Highness.Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear,and you'll wake up one day and all you'll
say is, ""Republic, republic, republic. ""Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?A soldier has the advantageof being able to
look his enemy in the eye, Senator.Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.Maximus.I'm going to need good men like you.How may I be of service, Highness?You're a man who knows what it is
to command.You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.Can I count on you
when the time comes?Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.Home? Well, no one's earned it more.Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.Lucilla's here. Did you know?She's not forgotten you.And now, you're the great man.If only you had been born a man,what a Caesar you would have made.Father.You would have been strong.I wonder, would you have been just?I would have been
what you taught me to be.How was yourjourney?Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?I need your help. With your brother.Of course.He loves you. He always has.Andhe will need you now, more than ever.Enough of politics.Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter,and I am a good father.This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?Good morning to you.I need three more horses.One! Two! Three!Four!One! Two!You sent for me, Caesar?- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.Why are we here?For the glory of the empire, sire.Yes.Yes, I remember.Do you see that map, Maximus?That is the world which I created.For 25 years,I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.Four years of peace in 20.And for what?I brought the sword. Nothing more.Caesar, your life...Please. Please don't call me that.Come. Please.Come sit.Let us talk together now,very simply, as men.Well, Maximus,talk.Five thousand of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.Two thousand will
never leave this place.I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.And what would you believe?They fought for you and for Rome.And what is Rome, Maximus?I've seen much of the rest of the world.It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.Yet you have never been there.You have not seen what it has become.I am dying, Maximus.When a man sees his end,he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.How will the world speak my name
in years to come?Will I be known as the philosopher?The warrior?The tyrant?Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?There was once a dream
that was Rome.You could only whisper it.Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,it was so fragile.And I fear that it will not survive
the winter.Maximus,let us whisper now,together, you and I.You have a son.Tell me about your home.My house is in the hills above Trujillo.A very simple place.Pink stones that warm in the sun.A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day,jasmine in the evening.Through the gate is a giant poplar.Figs, apples, pears.The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.He wants to be one of them.When was the last time
you were home?Two years, 264 days and this morning.I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.Worth fighting for.There is one more dutythat I ask of you before you go home.What would you have me do, Caesar?I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.I will empower you to one end alone,to give power back
to the people of Rome,and end the corruption
that has crippled it.Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?With all my heart, no.Maximus,that is why it must be you.But surely a prefect, a senator,somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.You have known that
since you were young.Commodus cannot rule.He must not rule.You are the son that I should have had.Commodus will accept my decision.He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.I need some time, sire.Yes.By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.Now embrace me as my son.And bring an old man another blanket.- My father favors you now.
- My lady.- It was not always so.
- Many things change.Many things. Not everything.Maximus, stop.Let me see your face.- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.What did my father want with you?To wish me well before I leave for home.You're lying.I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.I never acquired your comfort with it.True.But then you never had to.Life is more simple for a soldier.Or do you think me heartless?I think you have a talent for survival.Maximus, stop.Is it really so terrible seeing me again?No. I'm tired from battle.It hurts you to see my father so fragile.Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?I will always serve Rome.Do you know,I still remember you in my prayers.Oh, yes. I pray.I was sad to hear of your husband's
death. I mourned him.- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.Yes. Lucius.He'll be nearly eight years old.My son is also nearly eight.I thank you for your prayers.Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.Ancestors, I honor you,and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.Cicero.Sir.Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?Sometimes I do what I want to do.The rest of the time, I do what I have to.We may not be able to go home,
after all.Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?Yes, Father.You will not be emperor.Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?My powers will pass to Maximus,to hold in trust,until the Senate is ready to rule
once more.Rome is to be a republic again.- Maximus.
- Yes.My decision disappoints you?You wrote to me once,listing the four chief virtues.Wisdom,justice,fortitude,and temperance.As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.But I have other virtues, Father.Ambition.That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.Resourcefulness, courage.Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.Devotion to my family,to you.But none of my virtues were on your list.Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.Commodus,you go too far.I searched the faces of the godsfor ways to please you,
to make you proud.One kind word,one full hug,where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight,would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.What is it in me you hate so much?Commodus.All I've ever wantedwas to live up to you, Caesar.- Father.
- Commodus,your faults as a sonis my failure as a father.Come.Father.I would butcher the whole world,if you would only have loved me!Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.Lament with me, brother.Our great father is dead.How did he die?The surgeons say there was no pain.His breath gave out as he slept.Father.Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.Take my hand.I only offer it once.Quintus.Hail, Caesar.I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.- Sword.
- Sword.Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.The emperor died of natural causes.- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!Please don't fight, Maximus.I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.Ride until dawn,and then execute him.Quintus, look at me. Look at me!Promise me
that you will look after my family.Your family will meet you in the afterlife.Kneel.Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.At least give me a clean death.A soldier's death.The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.Praetorian!When was the last time
you were home?Two years, 264 days and this morning.Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again....with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.For all else is dust and air.Papa!Don't die.You'll meet them again.Not yet.No. They will clean it. Wait and see.Don't die.They'll feed you to the lions.They are won'th more than we are.Better now?Clean. You see?Proximo! My old friend.Every day is a great day
when you are here,but today is your most fortunate day.Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.Theyjust walk around eating
and not mating.You sold me queer giraffes.- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.- I do special price for you.
- On what?Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.You need both, I think.Get up.What's your trade?I was a hunter.No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Can'thage.Sit down.Mark of the legion.- Deserter.
- Maybe so, but who cares?He's a Spaniard.I'll take six. For 1,000.1,000?
The Numidian alone is won'th 2,000.These slaves are rotten.It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!I can negotiate.I'll give you 2,000,
and 4,000 for the beasts.That's 5,000 for an old friend.Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?I am Proximo.I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,which will be the last
of your miserable lives,than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.I did not pay good money for you
for your company.I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.And as your mother was there
at your beginning,so I shall be there at your end.And when you die, and die you shall,your transition shall be to the sound of...Gladiators,I salute you.Red.Yellow.Good.- Red.
- Red.Spaniard.That's enough for the moment!His time will come.Next.Spaniard,why don't you fight?We all have to fight.Well, I don't fight.I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words,and speak seven languages.Good.Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.Freedom?What do I have to do?You go in the arena and you kill me.And him,and the Numidian,and the deserter.And 100 more.And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.I can't do that.No?But I can.Is that the sign of your gods?Will that not anger them?The gods favor you.Red is the gods' color.You will need their help today.Proximo!Still leading with the German?The crowd love a barbarian.Besides that, he's making me rich.Has that Numidian fought before?No, first time.And that one, laborer, soldier?He's a Spaniard.He might as well be a eunuch
for what he brings to the ring.500 sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.And 1,000, that the Numidian
makes it through alone.Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?It's unethical.What if I make it 2,000?Some of you are thinking you won't fight,some that you can't fight.They all say that until they're out there.Listen.- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!Thrust this into another mars flesh,and they will applaud and love you
for that.And you,you may begin to love themfor that.Ultimately, we're all dead men.Sadly, we cannot choose how,but we can decide
how we meet that end,in order that we are rememberedas men.Come on!On the left, draw your shields!On the right, draw your swords!- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!Pair them up, red with yellow.Next!Move!Usurper!- Go away!
- You'll never rule us, Commodus!He enters Rome like a conquering
hero. But what has he conquered?Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.I think he could do very well.For Rome, or for you?Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.- Lucius!
- Mother!Hail, Caesar.Senators.Rome greets her new emperor.Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.Thank you, Falco.And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they werert too expensive.- Caesar.
- Gracchus.All Rome rejoices in your return,
Caesar.But there are many matters
that require your attention.To order, please. To order.For your guidance, Caesar,the Senate has prepared
a series of protocolsto begin addressing
the many problems in the city,beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.So, if Caesar...Don't you see, Gracchus?That's the very problem, isn't it?My father spent all his time at study,at books of learning and philosophy.He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.And all the while,
the people were forgotten.But the senate is the people, sire,chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.Or have such splendid mistresses,
Gaius.I think I understand my own people.Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us,out of his own extensive experience.I call it love.I am their father.
The people are my children.And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?No, but if you interrupt me again,I assure you that you shall.Senator, my brother is very tired.Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.Who are they to lecture me?Commodus, the Senate has its uses.What uses? All they do is talk.It should be just you and me and Rome.Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.Rome has changed.It takes an emperor to rule an empire.Of course, but leave the people their...Illusions?Traditions.My father's war against the barbarians.He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.The people always love victories.Why? They didn't see the battles.What do they care about Germania?They care about the greatness of Rome.""The greatness of Rome. ""Well, what is that?It's an idea. Greatness.- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.Do you not see, Lucilla?I will give the people a vision
of Rome, and they'll love me for it.And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!Games.One hundred and fifty days of games.He's cleverer than I thought.Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,if they werert so afraid
of his Praetorians.Fear and wonder.
A powerful combination.You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.It's the sand of the Colosseum.He'll bring them death,and they will love him for it.All you do is kill, kill, kill.The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.We want them to keep coming back.So don'tjust hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.Spaniard.So entertain!Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?Is this not why you're here?Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!What do you want?Girl?Boy?- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.You could be magnificent.I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectaclesto commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.I find that amusing,since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.So finally, after five years
of scratching a livingin flea-infested villages,we're finally going back
to where we belong.The Colosseum.You should see the Colosseum,
Spaniard.Fifty thousand Romans,watching every movement
of your sword,willing you to make that killer blow.The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.It rises. It rises up,like a storm.As if you were the thunder god himself.- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.You won your freedom?A long time ago, the Emperorpresented me with a rudius.It's just a wooden sword.The symbol of your freedom.He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.You knew Marcus Aurelius?I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.You asked me what I want.I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor,as you did.Then listen to me. Learn from me.I wasrt the best because I killed quickly.I was the best
because the crowd loved me.Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.I will win the crowd.I will give them something
they've never seen before.So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome togetherand have bloody adventures.And the great whore will suckle usuntil we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.And then,when enough men have died,perhaps you will have your freedom.Here. Use this.It's somewhere out there, my country.My home.My wife is preparing food.My daughters carry water from the river.Will I ever see them again?I think, no.Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?I think so.But then, I will die soon.They will not die for many years.I'll have to wait.But you would? Wait?Of course.You see,my wife and my sonare already waiting for me.You'll meet them again. But not yet.Not yet.- Unless...
- Not yet.Not yet.There he is.Out.Move, go, out!Good to see you again, old friend.Bring me fortune.Have you ever seen anything
like that before?I didn't know men
could build such things.Win the crowd.Get inside. Move.Inside.He sleeps so well because he's loved.Come, brother. It's late.I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.Commodus, drink this tonic.I think the time is almost right.I could announce
the dissolution of the Senateat the celebration to honor our father.Do you think I should?Are the people ready?I think you need your rest now.Will you stay with me?Still afraid of the dark, brother?Still.Always.- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.Then kiss me.Sleep, brother.Having servants who are deaf and muteat least ensures I live a little longer.They're arresting scholars now.Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.And mathematicians.And all to feed the arena.The Senate did not approve martial law.This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.I'm afraid to go out after dark.You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myselfwith.He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,planning the festival
to honor your father.He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.So just what is he planning?And what pays for it?These daily games are costing
a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.The future.The future pays for it.He's started selling the grain reserves.This can't be true.He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.The people will be starving in two years.I hope they're enjoying the games,because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.- Rome must know this.
- And how?He's going to dissolve the Senate.And who will tell them
before it's too late? You, Gracchus?You, Gaius.Will you make a speech
on the floor of the Senate,denouncing my brother?And then see your family
in the Colosseum?Who'd dare?I have been living
in a prison of fear every day,because my son is heir to the throne.He must die.Quintus and the Praetorians would
simply seize control for themselves.No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.Lucilla, Gaius is right.Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.So we do nothing?No, child. We keep our counsel.We prepare.As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.We are air.But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.One day, he'll have more enemies
than friends.And on that day, we will act.Then we will strike.But until then,we are docile.We are obedient.And we are treacherous.Come on!All right, that's enough.The Emperor wants battles,and I don't want to sacrifice
my best fighters.The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.- You get the battle of Can'thage.
- Massacre of Can'thage.Well, why don't you go down
to the prison,round up all the beggars and thieves?We've done that.If you want to give away
the best gladiatorsin the whole of the empire,then I want double the rates.You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract canceled.You don't like it?Then you can crawl back down
that shit hole that you came from.Cassius, please. You can free us.Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?Yes.They said you were a giant.They said you could crush
a mars skull with one hand.A mars? No.A boy's.- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.This is Argento and this is Scan'to.They were my horses.They were taken from me.I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.Master Lucius, it is time.I have to go.Your name is Lucius?Lucius Verus, after my father.Lower!- Claudius!
- Yes?- More shields!
- All right.When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him,and then speak together.Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.Go, and die with honor.Hail, mighty Caesar!- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!- We who are about to die salute you!
- We who are about to die salute you!On this daywe reach back to hallowed antiquityto bring you a re-creation
of the second fallof mighty Can'thage!On the barren plain of Zamathere stood the invincible armiesof the barbarian Hannibal.Ferocious mercenaries and warriorsfrom all brute nations,bent on merciless destruction,conquest.Your emperor is pleased to give youthe barbarian horde!Anyone here been in the army?Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.You can help me.Whatever comes out of these gates,we've got a better chance
of survival ifwe work together.Do you understand?Lfwe stay together, we survive.The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnairesof Scipio Africanus!To the death!- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!Stay close.Come together!Stay close. Staggered columns!You don't have a chance.Lock your shields. Stay as one.Hold!Hold! As one!Well done.Hold. Down low!Yes!Hagen!This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!Quickly!- Get out there.
- Hurry!Maximus!Single column! Single column!We win!My history's a little hazy, Cassius,but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Can'thage?Yes, sire.Forgive me, sire.No, I rather enjoy surprises.Who is he?They call him the Spaniard, sire.I think I'll meet him.Yes, sire.Hail to the barbarians!Forward! Arms at ready!Drop your weapons.Gladiator, the Emperor
has asked for you.I am at the Emperor's service.Rise. Rise.Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.Or was it Hercules?Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?You do have a name.My name is Gladiator.How dare you show your back
to me? Slave!You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,commander of the armies of the north,general of the Felix Legions,loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,father to a murdered son,husband to a murdered wife,and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.Arms!Live! Live! Live! Live!- Live! Live! Live! Live!
- Live! Live! Live! Live!Arms, at rest!- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!Father.Why is he still alive?I don't know.He shouldn't be alive.It vexes me.I'm terribly vexed.I did what I had to do.If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.You do see that.Yes.What did you feel when you saw him?I felt nothing.He wounded you deeply, didn't he?No more than I wounded him.They lied to me in Germania.They told me he was dead.If they lie to me, they don't respect me.If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?Then you must let the legions knowtheir treachery will not go unpunished.Poor sister.I wouldn't want to be your enemy.What will you do?This way.Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.I knew your brother
would send assassins.I didn't realize he would send his best.Maximus, he doesn't know.My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.- I knew nothing...
- Don't lie to me!I wept for them.As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?I have been living
in a prison of fear since that day.To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.To live in terror
every moment of every day,because your son is heir to the throne.I have wept.My son was innocent.So is mine.Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?What does it matter if I trust you or not?The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.The gods have spared me?I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.That is power.The mob is Rome.And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.Listen to me.My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.But while the people follow him,no one would dare stand up to him
until you.They oppose him, yet they do nothing.There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.One man above all.If I can arrange it, will you meet him?Do you not understand?I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!What possible difference can I make?This man wants what you want.Then have him kill Commodus!I knew a man once,a noble man.A man of principle who loved my father,and my father loved him.This man served Rome well.That man is gone.Your brother did his work well.Let me help you.Yes, you can help me.Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.Guard! The lady is finished with me.What's your name?Julian Crassus.Name?Marcus, sire.My father's name.They must have known
of Maximus' escape,when they found
the bodies of the four men.They thought it was a barbarian raid.These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.Load your arrows!Prepare to fire!Then perhaps it was you who knew,and never told me.- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?But a general is always in control.Always in command, isn't he?Yes, Caesar.Then give the command. Say it.Fire.Maximus.You commanded legions?
You had many victories?- Yes.
- In Germania?In many countries.General.You have a great name.He must kill your name
before he kills you.Yes, at the far end.- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.Senator Gracchus.Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.I don't pretend to be
a man of the people, Senator,but I do try to be a man for the people.- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!People of Rome!On the fourth day ofAntioch,we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.And in his majestic charity,the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Romewith an historical final match.Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,Caesar is pleased to bring youthe only undefeated championin Roman history,the legendary Tigris of Gaul!He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.This is not it. This is not it!Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.We mortals are but shadows and dust.Shadows and dust, Maximus!Representing the training lyceum
ofAntonius Proximo,Caesar is proud to give youAelius Maximus!They embrace him
like he's one of their own.The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.No, much sooner than that.It's been arranged.We who are about to die salute you.We're with you, Maximus!Fight on, finish it!Pull, pull!Loose! Loose!- Gut him!
- Kill!- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!- Kill!
- Kill!Maximus the Merciful!- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!Forward, arms at ready!What am I going to do with you?You simply won't die.Are we so different, you and I?You take life when you have to, as I do.I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.Then take it now.They tell me your sonsquealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.And your wifemoaned like a whorewhen they ravaged her again and againand again.The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,Highness.General! General!- General!
- Cicero!- General!
- Where are you camped?Ostia.- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.- Move along!
- Find me!Can they hear you?- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.- Yes.
- What do you say to them?To my boy,I tell him I will see him again soon,and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.To my wife,that is not your business.And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.So I can'tjust kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.He is defying you.His every victory is an act of defiance.The mob sees this,
and so do the Senate.Every day he lives, they grow bolder.- Kill him.
- No.I will not make a martyr of him.When I went to the Senate today,I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.And did you note what happened?- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.Not a single word of protest.Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.Why?I have been told of a certain sea snakewhich has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as ifwounded.Then its enemies will approach,and yet it will lie quite still.And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,and yet it remains still.So,we will lie still,and let our enemies come to us
and nibble.Have every senator followed.Cicero, my old friend.I thought perhaps I'd seen you
for the last time.- I thought you were dead.
- Close.How long have the men been in Ostia?All winter.- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?For you, tomorrow.I need you to do something for me.Come, see, witness.If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone,by doing this to him, they do...My goodness!- He got him, he's defeated.
- Give way!My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.- Back.
- My lady.I served your father at Vindobona.Back!And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.Stop. Stop.Stop!Stand back.The general sends word,
he will meet your politician.- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.Leave us.Senator Gracchus.General.I hope my coming here today
is evidence enoughthat you can trust me.- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?Yes. I can speak for them.You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?To what end?Get me outside the city walls.Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.But the legions
all have new commanders,loyal to Commodus.Let my men see me alive, and
you shall see where their loyalties lie.This is madness.No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.I will not trade one dictatorship
for another!The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.And after your glorious coup,
what then?You'll take your 5,000 warriors
and leave?I will leave.The soldiers will stay
for your protection,under the command of the Senate.So,once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?Tell me why.Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.I will kill Commodus.The fate of Rome I leave to you.Marcus Aurelius trusted you.His daughter trusts you.I will trust you.But we have little time.Give me two days,and I will buy your freedom.And you,you stay alive,or I'll be dead.Now we must go.He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.He'll find you.It won't work.The Emperor knows too much.And as for me,it's becoming dangerous.You'll be paid on my return.I give you my word.Your word? What if you don't return?Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?Trust?Who am I to trust?- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?He makes me rich.I know that you are a man
of your word, General.I know that you would die for honor.You would die for Rome.You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.But I, on the other hand,I'm an entertainer.Guard!He killed the man who set you free.Praetorians, master.Halt!Where have you been?I sent for you.Please, brother.What's troubling you?Does Gracchus have a new lover?I don't know.I thought you'd seen him.He infects everyone like a putrid fever.For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.And he will bleed, too.Very soon.But not tonight.Do you remember
what our father said once?""It's a dream,""a frightful dream,""life is. ""Do you think that's true?I don't know.I think it is.And I have only you to share it with.Open your mouth.You know I love you.And I love you.Out. Get out!Move!Congratulations, General.You've got very persuasive friends.My brother has had Gracchus arrested.We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.- You have done all this?
- Yes.You risk too much.I have much to pay for.You have nothing to pay for.You love your son.
You're strong for him.I am tired of being strong.My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.- Because your father chose me.
- No.Because my father loved you.And because I loved you.A long time ago.Was I very different then?You laughed more.I have felt alone all my life,except with you.I must go.Yes.There.And I got you.Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?I'm not a legionnaire.- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.A gladiator?Gladiators only fight in the games.Wouldrt you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!The savior of Rome?And who said that?Where's Lucius?He's with the Emperor, my lady.- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.She took it from a basket,and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.- It bit her in the breast?
- Yes.You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladiesbehave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.- I think it's silly.
- So do I.So do I.Sister, join us.I've been reading to dear Lucius.- I've been reading, too.
- Yes.He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.We've been reading about
the great Mark Antony,and his adventures in Egypt.And the queen killed herself
with a snake.And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.If you're very good,tomorrow night, I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.He was betrayedby those closest to him.By his own blood.They whispered in dark cornersand went out late at night,and conspired, and conspired.But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.He knew they were busy little bees.And one night he sat down
with one of them,and he looked at her,and he said,""Tell me what you've been doing,""busy little bee.""Or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.""You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood. ""And the Emperor was heartbroken.The little bee
had wounded him more deeplythan anyone else could ever have done.What do you think happened then,
Lucius?I don't know, Uncle.The little bee told him everything.Open, in the name of the Emperor!Proximo!Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!Proximo!Open the gates!Open the gates, Proximo.Do you want to die, old man?Here.Everything is prepared.It seems you have won your freedom.Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?- Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!Open the gates!Pull!Move! Form a column on the left!I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.We'll wait here for you, Maximus.- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.Go.Strength and honor.Aim. Arch your bows!Shadows and dust.Maximus!I'm sorry.It's done.And what of my nephew?And what of his mother?Should they share her lover's fate?Or should I be merciful?Commodus the Merciful.Lucius will stay with me now.And if his motherso much as looks at mein a manner that displeases me,he will die.If she decides to be noble,and takes her own life,he will die.And as for you,you will love me,as I have loved you.You will provide me with an heir
of pure blood,so that Commodusand his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.Am I not merciful?Am I not merciful!- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!I'm a soldier. I obey.Nothing happens to anyone that
he is not fitted by nature to bear.Maximus.They call for you.The general who became a slave.The slave who became a gladiator.The gladiator who defied an emperor.A striking story.Now the people want to know
how the story ends.Only a famous death will do.And what could be more gloriousthan to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?- You would fight me?
- Why not?Do you think I'm afraid?I think you have been afraid all your life.Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?I knew a man who once said,
""Death smiles at us all.""All a man can do is smile back. ""I wonder,did your friend smile at his own death?You must know.He was your father.You loved my father, I know,but so did I.That makes us brothers, doesn't it?Smile for me now, brother.Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.Ring formation!Quintus, sword.Give me your sword.Sword! Give me a sword!Sheathe your swords.
Sheathe your swords!Maximus.Quintus.Free my men.Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.There was a dream that was Rome.It shall be realized.These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.Free the prisoners. Go!Maximus.Lucius is safe.Go to them.You're home.Is Rome won'th one good mars life?We believed it once.Make us believe it again.He was a soldier of Rome.Honor him.Who will help me carry him?Now we are free.I will see you again.But not yet.Not yet."

is fathered by a priest.But in Utopia that couldn't be.For why?- For there the priests are very holy.
- Therefore very few.Is it anything interesting, Matthew?- Bless you, sir. I don't know.
- Bless you too, Matthew.To be sure, we have
some holy priests in England.- Oh, name some.
- Brother James.Man's a simpleton.It's from Cardinal Wolsey.What's he want?- Me.
- When?Now.In Hampton Court?
You won't be there by midnight.- The King's business.
- Queen's business.Mistress Anne Boleyn's business.Well, it's all the Cardinal's business.That's very true. And when the Cardinal
calls, you all come running, day or night.What is the man? A butcher's son.Chancellor of England, too.No, that's his office. What's the man?Surely, Your Grace, when a man
rises so high and so swiftly...we must think he was misplaced
in his origins.That, at least,
was the opinion of Aristotle and...A butcher's son and looks it.His looks, yes, I give you his looks.What was that you said, Richard?Nothing, Sir Thomas,
it was out of place.And Wolsey's still a butcher.And you're a member of the King's
High Council, not an errand boy.That is why I must go.The Duke would go
if the Cardinal called him.I might.I'll be back for breakfast.Go to bed.""Dear Lord, give us rest tonight,
or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.""Careful only for our soul's salvation.
For Christ's sake. Amen.""And bless our lord, the King.- ""And bless our lord, the King.""
- Amen!Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He's a frightened man.- Who is that?
- A young friend from Cambridge.- What's he want?
- What do they all want? A position.- Can you give him a position?
- Do you recommend him?No.- Sir Thomas.
- No.- Did you recommend me?
- No.Richard, I may have a position for you.- What? What position?
- Not now, Richard. Tomorrow.For you all, boatman.Thank you, sir.Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.Master Cromwell.You opposed me in the Council
this morning, Thomas.Yes, Your Grace.- You were the only one.
- Yes, Your Grace.You're a fool.Thank God there is only one fool
on the Council.Why did you oppose me?I thought Your Grace was wrong.A matter of conscience.You're a constant regret to me, Thomas.If you could just see facts flat on...without that horrible moral squint.With a little common sense,
you could have made a statesman.The King.Where's he been? Do you know?I, Your Grace?Spare me your discretion.He's been to play in the muck again.He's been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.More, are you going to help me?If Your Grace will be specific.You're a plodder! All right, we'll plod.The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?I'm very sure the King needs no advice
from me on what to do about it.Thomas, we're alone.
I give you my word, there's no one here.I didn't suppose there was, Your Grace.Do you favor a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?For God's sake, Your Grace!Then he needs a son. I repeat,
what are you going to do about it?I pray for it daily.God's death, he means it.That thing out there,
at least she's fertile.- But she's not his wife.
- No, Catherine's his wife...and she's barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?There are precedents.All right. Good. Pray by all means.But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.Have I your support, or have I not?The Pope gave a dispensation,
so that the King might marry...his brother's widow for state reasons.We are to ask the Pope to dispense with
his dispensation, also for state reasons?I don't like plodding, Thomas. Well?Then, clearly all we have to do is
to approach His Holiness and ask him.I think we might influence
the decision of His Holiness.By argument?Argument certainly. And pressure.Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.Pressure.No, Your Grace,
I'm not going to help you.Then goodnight, Master More.Let the dynasty die with Henry VIII
and we'll have dynastic wars again.Blood-witted barons ramping the country
from end to end.Is that what you want? Very well.England needs an heir.Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...perhaps not, there's much in the Church
which needs reformation, Thomas.All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.Now, explain how you, as a councilor
of England, can obstruct these measures...for the sake
of your own private conscience.I think that when statesmen forsake
their own private conscience...for the sake of their public duties...they lead their country
by a short route to chaos.And we shall have my prayers
to fall back on.You'd like that, wouldn't you?
To govern the country with prayers?Yes, I should.I'd like to be there when you try.Who will wear this after me?Who's our next chancellor?
You? Fisher? Suffolk?- Fisher for me.
- Aye, but for the King?What about my secretary,
Master Cromwell?Cromwell. He's a very able man.But?Me rather than Cromwell.Then, come down to earth.Until you do...you and I are enemies.As Your Grace wishes.As God wills.Perhaps, Your Grace.More! You should have been a cleric!Like yourself, Your Grace?Goodnight, Sir Thomas.Sir Thomas.Sir Thomas.Sir Thomas.- What's this?
- From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.- Leicester?
- You do more good than you know, sir.My daughter has a case, sir,
in the Court of Poor Man's Causes.Baked apples, sir.To sweeten my judgment.I'll give your daughter the same judgment
I would give my own.A fair one, quickly.Bless you, sir.I understand. Yes. I'll read it.
Yes. Thank you.Good evening, Sir Thomas.- I'll read it.
- It's an awkward case.- I could illuminate it for you...
- I'll read it.Just a moment or two...Boat!Sir?Chelsea, sir?Chelsea.I expect you'll make it
worth my while, sir.- You've got a license?
- Bless you, yes sir, I've got a license.- Well then, the fares are fixed.
- They are, sir.Hampton to Chelsea downstream,
a penny halfpenny.Chelsea to Hampton upstream,
a penny halfpenny.Whoever makes the regulations
doesn't row a boat.No. Three pence if you get me home
for breakfast.Thank you, sir.A nice cup, sir.Yes.That's worth money, sir.Mind a way, sir.Thank you, sir.- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.You said there was a post?Yes. I'll offer you a post, with a house,
a servant and Â£50 a year.What post?At the new school.A teacher!Richard, no one's going to give you
a place at court.Master Cromwell says
he'll do something for me.Cromwell?Well, if you know Cromwell
you don't need my help.Sir Thomas?If only you knew how much,
much rather, I had your help than his.Not to a place at court.Why not?Look.- What is it?
- It's a bribe!""I am the gift of Averil Machin.""And Averil Machin has a lawsuit
in the Court of Requests.Italian silver. Take it. No joke.Thank you.What will you do with it?Sell it.- And buy what?
- A decent gown!But Richard, that's a little bribe.At court they offer you all sorts of things,
home, manor houses, coats of arms.A man should go
where he won't be tempted.Why not be a teacher? You'd be
a fine teacher. Perhaps a great one.- If I was, who would know it?
- You! Your pupils. Your friends.God. Not a bad public, that.And a quiet life.You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.Yes, talking with the Cardinal.It's eating your heart out, isn't it?
The high affairs of state.The divorce?Boatman!Sir?- Take this gentleman to the New Inn!
- Right, sir.Sir Thomas?Thank you.Be a teacher.- Matthew.
- Sir.- Lady Alice in bed?
- Yes, sir.- Lady Margaret?
- No, sir.The Master Roper's here, sir.At this hour? Who let him in?He's a hard man to keep out, sir.Will wants to marry me, Father.Well, he can't marry you.Sir Thomas, I'm called to the Bar.Oh, congratulations, Roper.My family may not be at the palace,
but in the city...There's nothing wrong
with your family, Will.There's not much wrong with you.Except you seem to need a clock.I can buy a clock, sir.Roper, the answer is no...and will be no as long
as you're a heretic.Now, that's a word I don't like,
Sir Thomas!It's not a likeable word or thing.The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther's proved that to my satisfaction!Luther is an excommunicate!From a heretic Church!
Church? It's a shop!- Salvation by the shilling! And divorces!
- Will, no!- What I know, I'll say!
- You've no sense of the place!He's no sense of the time.Now listen well.Two years ago you were
a passionate churchman.Now you're a passionate Lutheran.We must just pray
that when your head's finished turning...your face is to the front again.- Is your horse here?
- No, sir, I walked.Well, take a horse from the stables
and get back home.Go along.May I come again?Yes. Soon.Is that final, Father?As long as he's a heretic, Meg,
that's absolute.What did Wolsey want?Nice boy, young Will.Terribly strong principles, though.Clumsy, too.- You're very pensive.
- You're very gay.Was it the divorce?To bed.They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.Old Roper was just the same...You don't want to talk about it.No.- I'm sorry you were awakened, chick.
- I wasn't sleeping very deeply.What did Wolsey want?- Will Roper's been.
- Will Roper?Yes, he's been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.- Why you don't beat that girl I...
- No.She's full of education
and it's a delicate commodity.Goodnight, Meg.Goodnight.Marry Meg. A lawyer's son.Well, she's a lawyer's daughter.Norfolk spoke of you for Chancellor
of England before he left.Well, he's a dangerous friend then.Wolsey's chancellor, God help him.But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you...If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp
a few small boats like ours.No.There'll be no new chancellors
while Wolsey lives.The Duke of Norfolk,
Earl Marshal of England.Have you any message for His Majesty?If I had served God...one half so well
as I've served my King...God would not have left me here,
to die in this place.Thank God you're dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.""I am straightly charged
by the King himself...""here openly to declare
how much all England...""is beholden to this man.""And how worthy he is
to have the highest room in the realm.""And how dearly the King's grace
doth love and trust him...""not only for much good council...""deliberate council,
but for better council yet...""that which is privy
to the King's person.""This same Sir Thomas More...""here made before you all to be...""Lord Chancellor of the Realm.""Calm yourself, Matthew.Fetch Lady Alice.That's very well.My lady! The King!Now remember, the visit's a surprise.But he'll know we're expecting him...It's a very great honor.
One friend calling on another.What's he really coming for?To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.- But he's had his answer.
- He wants another.Thomas!Your Majesty does my house more honor
than I fear my household will bear.No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.Look. Mud.By heaven, what an evening.Lady Alice,
I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.Yes, Your Grace. Well, no, Your Grace.Well, that is,
we are ready to entertain...This is my daughter Margaret, sire.She's not yet had the honor
to meet Your Grace.Why Margaret,
they told me you were a scholar.Answer, Margaret.Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.Can you dance, too?Not well, Your Grace.Well, I dance superlatively!That's a dancer's leg, Margaret!Lady Alice,
the river's given me an appetite.If Your Grace would share
a very simple supper.It would please me. Lead them in.Thomas and I will follow.Matthew.My lords and gentlemen!Margaret?Your Grace?Do you like music?Yes, Your Grace.They'll play to you.Now, listen to this.Sit down.Be seated. No courtship, Thomas.You're my friend, are you not?Your Majesty.Thank God I have a friend
for my chancellor.Readier to befriend, I trust,
than he was to be chancellor.My own knowledge of my poor abilities...I will judge of your abilities.Thomas?You know that Wolsey named you
for chancellor?Before he died, Wolsey named you,
and Wolsey was no fool.He was a statesman
of incomparable ability, Your Grace.Was he?Was he so?Then, why did he fail me?It was villainy then.Yes, villainy.
Secret opposition, secret.But deliberate, willful,
meditated opposition.Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.What is it? Thought!Because I'm simple and plain and deal
with every man straightforwardly.Because of that I say,
do they take me for a simpleton?Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.Pride right through.And he failed me.Failed me in the one thing that matters,
then as now.But look.Be seated.What an evening.A man could fight a lion.Some men could, Your Grace.Thomas...touching this matter of my divorce.Have you thought of it
since we last spoke?Of little else.Then you see your way clear to me?That you should put away
Queen Catherine, sire?Alas, as I think of it,
I see so clearly...that I cannot come with Your Grace,
that my endeavor is...not to think of it at all.Then you haven't thought enough!Lilac.We have them at Hampton.Not so fine as this, though.I'm in an excellent frame of mind.Thomas, you must consider,
I stand in peril of my soul.It was no marriage.I have lived in incest
with my brother's widow.Leviticus: ""Thou shalt not uncover
the nakedness of thy brother's wife.""Leviticus. Chapter 18, verse 16.Yes, Your Grace. But Deuteronomy...Deuteronomy is ambiguous!Your Grace, I'm not fitted
to meddle in these matters.To me, it seems a matter
for the Holy See...Thomas, does a man need a pope
to tell him where he's sinned?It was a sin.God's punished me.I've no son.Son after son she's borne me.All dead at birth,
or dead within the month.I never saw the hand of God
so clear in anything.It's my bounden duty
to put away the Queen.And all the popes, back to Peter,
shall not come between me and my duty!How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.Then, why does Your Grace
need my poor support?Because you're honest.And what is more to the purpose,
you're known to be honest.Those like Norfolk follow me
because I wear the crown.Those like Cromwell follow
because they're jackals with sharp teeth...and I'm their tiger.
A mass follows me...because it follows anything that moves.And then there's you.I am sick to think
how much I must displease Your Grace.No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.But respect...man, that's water in the desert.How'd you like our music?That air they played,
it had a certain...Well, tell me what you thought of it.Could it have been Your Grace's own?Discovered!Now I'll never know your true opinion,
and that's irksome.Well, we artists, we love praise,
yet we love truth better.- Then I will tell my true opinion.
- Well?To me it seemed delightful.Thomas, I chose the right man
for chancellor.I should in fairness add that my taste
in music is reputedly deplorable.Your taste in music is excellent!It exactly coincides with my own.Music.Music.Send them back without me, Thomas.
I'll live here in Chelsea and make music.My house is at Your Grace's disposal.Touching this other business,
mark you...I'll have no opposition.Your Grace.No opposition, I say. No opposition.Be seated.I'll leave you out of it
but you are my chancellor.I don't take it kindly
and I'll have no opposition!I see how it will be.The bishops will oppose me!The full-fed princes of the Church!
Hypocrites! All hypocrites!Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!Your Grace is unjust.If I cannot serve Your Grace
in this great matter of the Queen.I have no queen!Catherine's not my wife!No priest can make her so.They that say she is my wife
are not only liars, but traitors!Yes, traitors!That I will not brook now!Treachery!I will not brook.It maddens me!It is a deadly canker in the body politic,
and I will have it out!See?You see how you've maddened me?I hardly know myself.If you could come with me,
there's no man I'd sooner raise...yes, with my own hand.Your Grace overwhelms me.What's that?Eight o'clock, Your Grace.Lift yourself up, man.Have I not promised
I'll leave you out of it?Shall we eat?If Your Grace pleases.Eight o'clock, you said.The tide will be turning.- I was forgetting the tide. I must go.
- I'm sorry, Your Grace.If I don't catch the tide
I'll not get back to Richmond.No, don't come.Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.So we give you our thanks
and we say goodnight!What's this?- You crossed him!
- Somewhat.- Why?
- I couldn't find the other way.You're too nice altogether, Thomas.- Woman, mind your house!
- I am minding my house!God save Your Majesty!God save Your Grace!God save the King!Lift!Drop blades!Sire! Sire! Sire!Are you coming my way, Rich?No.I think you should, you know.I can't tell you anything.Well?Thomas?Stay friends with him.Whatever may be done by smiling,
you may rely on me to do.Set your mind at rest.This is not the stuff
of which martyrs are made.Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.Will wants to talk to you, Father.I told him it wouldn't be convenient.You were quite right.You're very free
with my daughter's hand, Roper.Yes.It's of that I wish to speak.Sir, you've had a disagreement
with His Majesty.- Have I?
- So Meg tells me.I offer my congratulations.If it's true,
is it a matter for congratulation?Yes!Sir, when last I asked you
for your daughter's hand...you objected to my unorthodox opinions.- I did.
- Yes.Well, since then my views
have somewhat modified.Well, that's good hearing, Will.Mind you, I modify nothing concerning
the various corruptions in the Church.- Quite right.
- But an attack upon the Church herself...no. I see behind that an attack on God.- Roper!
- The Devil's work...to be done by the Devil's ministers!For heaven's sake, remember my office.If you stand on your office...No, I don't stand on it, but there are
certain things I may not hear.Sir Thomas.Richard?I fell.Lady Alice.- Lady Margaret.
- Good evening.Do you know William Roper, the younger?By reputation, of course.- Good evening, Master...
- Rich.You've heard of me?Yes.In what connection?
I don't know what you can have heard.I sense that I'm not welcome here.Why Richard? Have you done something
to make you not welcome?Cromwell is asking questions.About you. He's always asking
questions about you and your opinions.Of whom?Of him, for one.
That's one of his sources.Of course. That's one of my servants.All right, Matthew.Well, you look at me
as though I were an enemy.Why Richard, you're shaking.Help me.How?Employ me.No.- Employ me!
- No.I would be faithful.You couldn't answer for yourself
even so far as tonight.Arrest him!- For what?
- He's dangerous!- Libel. He's a spy!
- That man's bad!- There's no law against that.
- God's law!- Then God can arrest him.
- While you talk, he's gone!Go he should, if he were the Devil,
until he broke the law.- Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
- Yes, what would you do?Cut a road through the law
to get after the Devil?Yes. I'd cut down every law in England
to do that.And when the last law was down,
and the Devil turned on you...where would you hide, Roper,
the laws all being flat?This country is planted with laws
from coast to coast...Man's laws, not God's,
and if you cut them down...and you're just the man to do it...do you really think you could stand
upright in the wind that would blow then?Yes.I give the Devil benefit of law
for my own safety's sake.- Master Rich?
- Yes.In there, sir.Rich? Come in.Taken you long enough to get here.Have I kept you waiting?Months.- Here.
- Thank you.Do you know the news?- What news?
- Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.And I succeed him.Secretary to the Council?You?'Tis surprising, isn't it?I mean, one sees that's logical.Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...as His Majesty would say.You see how I trust you.I'd never repeat
or report a thing like that.What kind of thing
would you repeat or report?Nothing said in friendship.Do you believe that?- Why, yes.
- No, seriously.Well, yes.Rich, seriously.That would depend what I was offered.Don't say it just to please me.It's true. It would depend
what I was offered.Well, there is another post vacant.Collector of Revenues for York.Is it in your gift?Effectively.What must I do for it?I know a man
who wants to change his woman.Normally a matter of small importance,
but in this case...it's our liege, Lord Henry,
the eighth of that name.Which is a quaint way of saying that
if he wants to change his woman, he will.And our job as administrators...is to minimize the inconvenience
which this is going to cause.That's our only job, Rich,
to minimize the inconvenience of things.A harmless occupation
you would say, but no.We administrators are not liked, Rich.We are not popular.I say ""we"" on the assumption you'll accept
the post at York I've offered you.Yes.It's a bad sign when people are depressed
by their own good fortune.- I'm not depressed.
- You look depressed.I was lamenting. I've lost my innocence.Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor,
now there's an innocent man.The odd thing is, he is.Yes, I say he is. Unhappily...his innocence is tangled up
in this problem...that you can't change your woman
without a divorce...and you can't get a divorce
unless the Pope says so.And from this meaningless circumstance,
I foresee a certain measure of...- Inconvenience?
- Just so.This goblet he gave you,
how much was it worth?Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?Fifty shillings.It was a gift, wasn't it,
from a litigant, a woman?- Yes.
- Which court? Chancery?Don't get drunk!Which court was the litigant's case?Court of Requests.There. That wasn't too painful, was it?- No.
- No.And you'll find it easier, next time.My Lord Archbishop, my lords...Reverend Doctors of the Church.The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...to his trusty well-beloved subjects...pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.""His Majesty...""acknowledges your humble
admission of many grievous errors...""for which he accepts...""the manumission
of Â£100,000 in token.""Mindful for the well-being of the realm
and the quietness of his subjects...""His Majesty requires that you do now
straightly renounce your pretended...""allegiance to the See of Rome.""And admit the statute
passed through parliament...""acknowledging
the King's good title...""Supreme Head of the Church
in England.""Well, my lords, what's your answer?Yea or nay?His Majesty accepts your resignation
very sadly.He's mindful of your goodness
and past loyalty.And in any matter concerning your honor
and welfare he'll continue your good lord.You will convey my humble gratitude.- Help me with this.
- Not I.- Alice?
- No.Sun and moon, Master More, you're taken
for a wise man. Is this wisdom?To betray your ability...abandon your station
and forget your duty to your kith and kin?Shall I, sir?No, thank you, son Roper.Margaret...will you?Yes.If you want.There's my clever girl.Well done, sir! In my opinion,
that thing's a degradation.I'll tell you my opinion
of the King's title, too...Don't! Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...and may have children.All right, Thomas, make me understand...because I tell you,
to me this looks like cowardice!All right, I will.This isn't reformation,
this is war against the Church.Our King has declared war on the Pope
because the Pope will not declare...- ... that our Queen is not his wife.
- And is she?Is she?Have I your word that what we say here
is between us two?Very well.And if the King should command you
to repeat what I may say?I should keep my word to you.Then what has become of your oath
of obedience to the King?You lay traps for me!No, I show you the times.We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope's a prince, isn't he?He is. He's also the descendant
of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...which includes the respect
of your country, for a belief?Because what matters
is that I believe it, or rather, no...not that I believe it,
but that I believe it.- I trust I make myself obscure?
- Perfectly.Why do you insult me
with this lawyer's chatter?Because I'm afraid.Man, you're ill.This isn't Spain, you know.
This is England.My friends, you all know
why I've called you here.I have today resigned my office.I am no longer a great man.Sir, we want you to know
that we're all on your side.My side? What side is that?Well, sir, we all know what you think.None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess...and babble it about,
you do me no good service.Since I am no more a great man,
I no longer need a great household.Nor can I afford one.
You will have to go.However, I still number some great men
among my friends...and they still need great households.No one will be turned away
until we've found another place for him.- We can't find places for them all.
- Yes, we can.Thank you.That is all.What about you, Matthew?Will you stay?Well, sir, that's according.There will be more work and less money.Well then, I don't see how I can then, sir.
After all, I've got my own...Quite right, Matthew. Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.I shall miss you.Damn me! Isn't that them all over!Miss me? What's in me for him to miss?""Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?""
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.And that's it. And that's all of it! All right,
so he's down on his luck, I'm sorry.I don't mind saying
that I'm sorry, bad luck.If I had good luck to spare
he could have some!I wish we could have good luck
all the time.I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings! But we don't.Well, there's an end of you.What'll you do now? Sit by the fire...and make goslings in the ash?Not at all, Alice.I expect I'll write a bit...I'll write...I'll read, I'll think.I think I'll learn to fish.I'll play with my grandchildren
when son Roper's done his duty.- Alice, shall I teach you to read?
- No, by God!Poor, silly man, you think
they'll leave you here to think?If we govern our tongues, they will!I have a word to say on that. I've made
no statement. I've resigned, that's all.The King is made, by act of parliament,
Supreme Head of the Church in England.This English Church will divorce him from
the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.But on any of these matters,
have you heard me make a statement?No.If I'm to lose my rank and fall to
housekeeping, I want to know the reason.- So make a statement now.
- No.Alice, it's a point of law.
Accept it from me...that in silence is my safety,
under the law.And my silence must be absolute,
it must extend to you.In short, you don't trust me.I'm the Lord Chief Justice,
I'm Cromwell, I'm the keeper of the Tower.I take your hand...I clamp it on the Bible,
on the blessed Cross and I say:""Woman, has your husband
made a statement on these matters?""On peril of your soul remember,
what is your answer?""No.And so it must remain.Have you opened your mind to Meg?Would I tell Meg what I won't tell you?Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.This is a dangerous matter then...if you've not told Meg.I don't think so. No.When they find I'm silent...they'll want nothing better
than to leave me silent.You'll see.But he's silent, Master Secretary,
why not leave him silent?Your Grace, not being
a man of letters...you perhaps don't realize
the extent of his reputation.This silence of his
is bellowing up and down Europe!In Europe he is claimed
as the King's enemy.Rubbish! Crank he may be,
traitor he is not.Exactly. And with a little pressure...With a little pressure
he can be got to say so.That's all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...- ... to the present administration.
- I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.The King does not agree with you.What kind of pressure do you think
you can bring to bear?I have evidence that Sir Thomas,
while he was a judge, accepted bribes.What?Goddammit! He was the only judge
since Cato who didn't accept bribes!When was there a chancellor
whose possessions, after three years...totaled Â£100 and a gold chain?It is, as you imply, common practice...but a practice may be common
and remain an offence.This offence could send a man
to the Tower.Come here.This woman's name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.- She entered a case...
- A property case it was.Shut your mouth.A property case in the Court of Requests
in April, 1528.And got a wicked false judgment!And got an impeccably correct judgment
from Sir Thomas.- No, sir, it was not!
- Tell the gentleman...about the gift you gave the judge.I gave him a cup, sir.A silver Italian cup I bought in Leicester,
for 100 shillings.Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?Yes, sir, he did.He did accept it. We can corroborate that.
You can go.- To my way of thinking...
- Go!- Is that your witness?
- No.By an odd coincidence that cup later
came into the hands of Master Rich here.How?- He gave it to me, Your Grace.
- Gave it to you? Why?A gift.Yes, you were a friend, weren't you?When did Thomas give you this thing?I can't exactly remember.Do you ""remember"" what you did with it?- I sold it.
- Where?- A shop.
- Has the shop still got it?No. They've lost all track of it.How convenient.You doubt Master Rich's word,
Your Grace?It had occurred to me.This is the bill of sale.That cow put her case into court in April,
you said. This is dated May.In other words, the moment Thomas knew
the cup was a bribe...he dropped it into the nearest gutter.The facts will bear that interpretation,
I suppose.This is a horse that won't run,
Master Secretary.Just a trial gallop.
We'll find something better.- I want no part of it.
- You have no choice.What's that you say?The King particularly wishes you
to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.He's not told me that.Indeed? He told me.Look here, Cromwell...what's the purpose of all this?There you have me.It's a matter of conscience, I think.The King wants Sir Thomas
to bless his marriage.If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding
now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.He won't attend the wedding.If I were you, I'd try and persuade him.I really would try, if I were you.Cromwell, are you threatening me?My dear Norfolk, this isn't Spain.This is England!Thomas? Thomas!Lady Margaret?Yes.We've been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.I have a letter for your father,
Lady Margaret. From Hampton Court.He's to answer certain charges
before Secretary Cromwell.Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.Master Rich will make a record
of our conversation.Good of you to tell me,
Master Secretary.I think you know one another.Indeed yes, we're old friends.That's a nice gown you have, Richard.Sir Thomas, believe me.No, that's asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.You have no more sincere admirer
than myself.No, not yet, Rich, not yet.If I might hear the charges.- The charges?
- I understand there are certain charges.Some ambiguities of behavior
I should like to clarify, hardly charges.Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.The King is not pleased with you.I am grieved.And yet, do you know that even now,
if you could bring yourself...to agree with the Church,
universities, the Lords and the Commons...there is no honor which His Majesty
would be likely to deny you?I am well acquainted with
His Grace's generosity.Very well.You have heard of the so-called
""Holy Maid of Kent""...who was executed for prophesying
against the King?- Yes, I met her.
- Yes, you met her.Yet you did not warn His Majesty
of her treason. How was that?She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?- Happily, there were witnesses.
- You wrote a letter to her.Yes. I wrote, advising her to abstain
from meddling in the affairs of state.I have a copy of the letter.
Also witnessed.- You have been cautious.
- I like to keep my affairs regular.In the June of 1521,
the King published a book.A theological work.It was called,
A Defense of the Seven Sacraments.For which he was named ""Defender
of the Faith"" by His Holiness, the Pope.By the Bishop of Rome,
or do you insist on ""pope""?No. ""Bishop of Rome"" if you like.
It doesn't alter his authority.Thank you. You come to the point
very readily. What is that authority?For example, in the Church of England...what exactly is
the Bishop of Rome's authority?You will find it very ably set out
and defended, Master Secretary...in the King's book.In the book published under
the King's name, would be more accurate.- You wrote this book.
- I wrote no part of it.I don't mean you actually held the pen.I answered to my best ability,
some points of common law...which the King put to me,
as I was bound to do.Do you deny you instigated it?It was from first to last
the King's own project.The King says not.The King knows the truth of it.And whatever he may have said to you...he will not give evidence
to support this accusation.Why not?Because evidence is given on oath,
and he will not perjure himself.If you don't know that,
then you don't yet know him.Sir Thomas More.Have you anything to say...regarding the King's marriage
with Queen Anne?I understood
I was not to be asked that again.Then you understood wrongly.
These charges...They are terrors for children,
Master Secretary, not for me!Then know that the King
commands me to charge you...in his name, with great ingratitude!And to tell you that there never was,
nor could be, so villainous a servant...nor so traitorous
a subject, as yourself!So...I am brought here at last.Brought?You've brought yourself
to where you stand now.You may go.For the present.What will you do now?Whatever's necessary.Boat!Oh, come, come,
it's not as bad as all that!Howard!I can't get home.They won't bring me a boat.Do you blame them?Is it as bad as that?It's every bit as bad as that!Then it's good of you
to be seen with me.I followed you.Were you followed?- You're dangerous to know!
- Then don't know me.- I do know you.
- I mean as a friend.- I am your friend. I wish I wasn't, but I am.
- What's to be done then?- Give in.
- I can't give in, Howard.Our friendship's more mutable than that.The one fixed point in the world
of turning friendship...- ... is that Sir More won't give in.
- To me it has to be, for that's myself.Affection goes as deep in me
as you, I think.But only God is love right through,
Howard, and that's my self.And who are you?A lawyer! And a lawyer's son!We're supposed to be the proud ones,
the arrogant ones, we've all given in.Why must you stand out?Goddammit man! It's disproportionate!You'll break my heart.No one is safe, Howard,
and you have a son.We'll end our friendship now.- For friendship's sake?
- Yes.Daft!Norfolk, you're a fool!You can't place a quarrel,
you haven't the style.Hear me out. You and your class
have given in, as you rightly call it...'cause this country's religion
means nothing to you at all.Well, that's a foolish saying
for a start!The nobility of England...The nobility of England would have
snored through the Sermon on the Mount!But you'll labor like scholars
over a bulldog's pedigree.An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.We've had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.You can be cruel when you want,
but I've always known that.What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?- Yes.
- It's their nature?- Yes.
- It's why you breed them?It's so with men.I will not give in, because I oppose it.Not my pride, not my spleen,
nor any other of my appetites, but I do, I.Is there, in the midst of all this muscle,
no sinew that serves no appetite...of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?
There is!- Give that some exercise, my lord!
- Thomas!As you stand you'll go before your Maker
ill conditioned!Now steady.And he'll think that, somewhere back along
your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!Cast in this very house
on April 3, last year...it is a matter very fit
for the Commons, gathered here...in parliament, to take in hand.Or, in consequence
of the decay of guilds...the woolen cloth, now coming out
of Yorkshire, Lincoln...and the like,
is not to blame and this...I will defer the rest
of my matter to later.That the loyal Commons, here assembled,
will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.For as much as it concerns the King's
new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.Both matters pleasing
to a loyal subject.Mark, my Masters...there is among us
a brood of discreet traitors...to which deceit
the King can brook no longer.And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now
drive these subtle foxes from their covert.Father?Margaret!I couldn't get a boat.What is it, Meg?Father, there's a new act
going through parliament.And by this act,
they're going to administer an oath...about the marriage.On what compulsion is the oath?- High treason.
- But what is the wording?Do the words matter?
We know what it means.Tell me the words.An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.Take it?And if it can be taken,
you must take it, too.No!Listen, Meg. God made the angels
to show him splendor.As he made animals for innocence
and plants for their simplicity.But Man he made to serve him wittily,
in the tangle of his mind.If he suffers us to come to such a case
that there is no escaping...then we may stand to our tackle
as best we can.And yes, Meg, then we can clamor like
champions, if we have the spittle for it.But it's God's part, not our own,
to bring ourselves to such a pass.Our natural business lies in escaping.If I can take this oath, I will.I would, for my sake,
you could take the oath.I never took a man into the Tower
less willingly.Thank you, Master Governor.Thank you.Sir Thomas.Sir Thomas.Sir Thomas!This is iniquitous.- Where to this time?
- Richmond Palace.Sit down.This is the Seventh Commission
to inquire into the case...of Sir Thomas More, appointed
by His Majesty's Council.Have you anything to say?No.- Seen this document before?
- Many times.It is the Act of Succession.These are the names
of those who have sworn to it.- I have, as you say, seen it before.
- Will you swear to it?No.Thomas, we must know...We must know plainly whether you
recognize the offspring of Queen Anne...as heirs to the throne.The King in parliament
tells me that they are.- Of course I recognize them.
- Will you swear to it?- Yes.
- Then why won't he swear to the act?Because there is more
than that in the act.Just so. Sir Thomas, it states in the
preamble that the King's former marriage...to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...she being his brother's widow and the Pope
having no authority to sanction it.Is that what you deny?Is that what you dispute?Is that what you are not sure of?You insult His Majesty and Council
in the person of the Lord Archbishop!I insult no one.I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.- Then your reasons must be treasonable!
- Not ""must be,"" may be.It's a fair assumption!The law requires more than an assumption,
the law requires a fact.Of course, I cannot judge
your legal standing in the case...but until I know the ground
of your objections...I can only guess
your spiritual standing, too.If you're willing to guess that, it should be
small matter to guess my objections.Then you do have objections to the act?Well, we know that, Cromwell!No, my lord, you don't.You may suppose I have objections,
all you know is that I will not swear to it...for which you cannot lawfully
harm me further.But if you were right in supposing me
to have objections, and right again...in supposing my objections
to be treasonable...the law would let you cut my head off.Oh, yes.Well done, Sir Thomas.I've been trying to make that clear
to His Grace for some time.Oh, confound all this!
I'm not a scholar.I don't know if the marriage
was lawful or not...but damn it, Thomas,
look at these names.Why can't you do as I did,
and come with us, for fellowship?And when we die, and you are sent
to heaven for doing your conscience...and I am sent to hell for not doing mine,
will you come with me, for fellowship?So, those of us whose names are there,
are damned, Sir Thomas?I have no window to look into
another man's conscience.I condemn no one.- Then the matter is capable of question?
- Certainly.But that you owe obedience to the King
is not capable of question.So weigh a doubt against a certainty
and sign.Some men think the earth is round,
others think it flat.It is a matter capable of question.But if it is flat,
will the King's command make it round?And if it is round,
will the King's command flatten it?No, I will not sign.Then you have more regard for
your own doubt than the King's command?- For myself I have no doubt.
- No doubt of what?No doubt that I will not take this oath.But why I will not, you,
Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.I might get it out of you in other ways.You threaten like a dockside bully.How should I threaten?Like a minister of state, with justice!Justice is what you're threatened with.Then I am not threatened.Gentlemen, can't I go to bed?Aye. The prisoner may retire
as he requests.- Unless you...
- I see no purpose in prolonging this.Then, goodnight, Thomas.May I have one or two more books?Why, you have books?Yes.I didn't know, you shouldn't have.May I see my family?No.Captain!Master Secretary?Have you ever heard the prisoner speak
of the King's divorce, supremacy...- ... or the King's marriage?
- No, not a word.If he does, you will repeat it to me.Of course.Rich.Secretary?Tomorrow morning,
remove the prisoner's books.Is that necessary?With regards to this case,
the King is becoming impatient.- Aye, with you.
- With all of us.The King's impatience
will embrace a duke or two.Master Secretary.Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.The Attorney General for Wales.His post is vacant.You said that I might approach you.Not now, Rich.He must submit. He must!Rack him.No. The King's conscience
will not permit it.We have to find some other way.Sir Thomas!Father!What? Margaret?Father!Meg. For God's sake,
they haven't put you in here?- No, sir, a visit.
- A brief one, Sir Thomas.Father.- Good morning, husband.
- Good morning.Good morning, Will.Well, this is a hellish place!Except it's keeping me from you,
my dears, it isn't so bad.It's remarkably like any other place.- It drips!
- Yes. It's too near the river.Well, what is it?Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!Is this why they've let you come?Yes.Meg's under oath to persuade you.That was silly, Meg.How do you plan to do that?Father.""God more regards the thoughts
of the heart than the words of the mouth.""- Well, so you've always told me.
- Yes.Then say the words of the oath
and in your heart think otherwise.What is an oath then,
but words we say to God?Listen, Meg.When a man takes an oath, he's holding
his own self in his own hands...like water.And if he opens his fingers then,
he needn't hope to find himself again.Some men aren't capable of this, but I'd be
loathed to think your father one of them.- I have another argument.
- Oh, Meg.In any state that was half good,
you would be raised up high, not here...- ... for what you've done already.
- All right.It's not your fault
the state's three-quarters bad.No.If you elect to suffer for it,
you elect to be a hero.That's very neat.But look now. If we lived in a state
where virtue was profitable...common sense would make us saintly.But since we see that avarice, anger,
pride and stupidity...commonly profit far beyond charity,
modesty, justice and thought...perhaps we must stand fast a little...even at the risk of being heroes.But in reason!Haven't you done as much
as God can reasonably want?Well, finally it isn't
a matter of reason.Finally, it's a matter of love.You're content then to be shut up here
with mice and rats...- ... when you might be home with us?
- Content?If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be
through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.I haven't told you
what the house is like without you.Don't, Meg.- What we do in the evening without you.
- Meg, have done.We don't read because we've no candles.We don't talk because we wonder
what they're doing to you.The King is more merciful.
He doesn't use the rack.Two minutes to go, sir.- I thought you'd like to know.
- Two minutes!- Jailer!
- Sorry, sir. Two minutes.Listen, you must leave the country.
All of you must leave the country.- And leave you?
- It makes no difference.They won't let me see you again.You must all go on the same day,
but not on the same boat.- Different boats from different ports.
- After the trial, then.There'll be no trial, they have no case.Do this for me, I beseech you.- Will?
- Yes, sir.- Margaret?
- Yes.Alice?- Alice, I command you!
- Right.This is splendid.- I know who packed this.
- I packed it.Yes.You still make
a superlative custard, Alice.Do I?That's a nice dress you have on.Nice color anyway.My God, you think little of me!I know I'm a fool...but I'm not such a fool
as to be lamenting for my dresses...or to relish complimenting
on my custards.I'm well rebuked.- Alice...
- No!I'm sick with fear when I think
of the worst they may do to me.But worse than that will be to go
with you not understanding why I go.I don't.If you can tell me that you understand,
I might make a good death, if I have to.- Your death's no good to me.
- You must tell me that you understand.I don't!I don't believe this had to happen!If you say that
I don't see how I'm to face it.It's the truth!- You're an honest woman.
- Much good may it do me.I'll tell you what I'm afraid of...that when you've gone,
I shall hate you for it.You mustn't, Alice.You mustn't.As for understanding, I understand you're
the best man I ever met or ever likely to.And if you go, God knows why I suppose,
though as God's my witness...God's kept deadly quiet about it.And if any one wants to know
my opinion of the King and his Council...he only has to ask for it!Why, it's a lion I married.A lion. A lion.This is good.It's very good.Sorry, Sir Thomas!- Oh, for pity's sake!
- Time's up, sir.- But one more minute!
- You don't know what you're asking.- Come along, Miss.
- For heaven's sake.Now, don't do that, sir.Now, madam, don't make trouble.Come along, please, Lady Alice.Take your muddy paws off me!Filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!I'll see you suffer for this!Goodbye.You must understand my position, sir.I'm a plain, simple man
and I just want to keep out of trouble.Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Savior,
clear my wits.Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God,
comfort my wife and daughter...and forgive me for them.Sir Thomas More, though you have
heinously offended the King's majesty...we hope that if you'll even now fore think
and repent of obstinate opinion...you may still taste his gracious pardon.My lords, I thank you.As for the matters
you may charge me with...I fear from my present weakness,
that neither my wit...nor my memory will serve...to make sufficient answer.I should be glad to sit down.A chair for the prisoner.Master Secretary Cromwell,
have you the charge?- I have, my lord.
- Then read the charge.""That you did willfully and maliciously
deny and deprive...""our liege, Lord Henry,
of his undoubted certain title...""Supreme Head of the Church
in England.""But, I have never denied this title.At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth,
and again at Richmond...you stubbornly refused the oath.Was this no denial?No, this was silence.And for my silence,
I am punished with imprisonment.- Why have I been called again?
- On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.For which the punishment
is not imprisonment.Death...comes for us all, my lords.Yes, even for kings he comes.The death of kings is not in question,
Sir Thomas.Nor mine, I trust,
until I'm proven guilty.Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas,
as it always has!Is that so, my lord?Then I'll keep a good grip on it.So, Sir Thomas...you stand on your silence?I do.But, gentlemen of the jury...there are many kinds of silence.Consider first the silence of a man
when he is dead.Suppose we go into the room
where he is laid out and we listen.What do we hear?Silence.What does it betoken, this silence?Nothing. This is silence
pure and simple.But let us take another case.Suppose I were to take a dagger
from my sleeve...and make to kill the prisoner with it.And my lordships there, instead of crying
out for me to stop, maintain their silence.That would betoken!It would betoken a willingness
that I should do it.And under the law,
they would be guilty with me.So silence can,
according to the circumstances...speak.Let us consider now the circumstances
of the prisoner's silence.The oath was put to loyal subjects
all over the country who all declared...His Grace's title to be just and good!But when it came to the prisoner,
he refused!He calls this ""silence.""Yet, is there a man in this court...Is there a man in this country...who does not know
Sir Thomas More's opinion of this title?Yet, how can this be?Because this silence betokened...nay, this silence was not silence at all,
but most eloquent denial!Not so.Not so, Master Secretary.The maxim of the law is,
""Silence gives consent.""If, therefore, you wish to construe
what my silence betokened...you must construe that I consented,
not that I denied.Is that in fact what the world
construes from it?Do you pretend that is what you wish
the world to construe from it?The world must construe
according to its wits.This court must construe
according to the law.My lords, I wish to call
Sir Richard Rich!Richard Rich, come into court.Richard Rich!""I do swear the evidence I'll give
before the court shall be the truth...""the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.""""So help me God,"" sir.""So help me God.""Now Rich, on May 12,
you were at the Tower?- I was.
- For what purpose?I was sent to carry away
the prisoner's books.- Did you talk with the prisoner?
- Yes.Did you talk of the King's supremacy
of the Church?Yes.What did you say?I said to him, ""Supposing there were
an act of parliament...""to say that I, Richard Rich,
were to be king.""Would not you, Master More,
take me for king?""""That I would,"" he said.""For then you would be king.""Yes?Then he said,
""But I will put you a higher case.""How, if there were an act of parliament,
to say that God should not be God?""- This is true and then you said...
- Silence!Continue.But then I said,
""I will put you a middle case.""Parliament has made our King
Head of the Church.""Why will you not accept him?""Well?And then he said,
""Parliament had not the power to do it.""Repeat the prisoner's words.He said:""Parliament had not the competence.""Or words to that effect.He denied the title!He did.In good faith, Rich, I am sorrier
for your perjury than my peril.- Do you deny this?
- Yes!You know if I were a man
who heeded not the taking of an oath...I need not be here.Now, I will take an oath.If what Master Rich has said is true...I pray I may never see God in the face.Which I would not say, were it otherwise,
for anything on earth!- That is not evidence.
- Is it probable...Is it probable
that after so long a silence on this...the very point
so urgently sought of me...I should open my mind
to such a man as that?Sir Richard, do you wish
to modify your testimony?No, my lord.Is there anything you wish
to take away from it?No, my lord.Have you anything to add?No, my lord.- Have you, Sir Thomas?
- To what purpose?I am a dead man.You have your will of me.Then the witness may withdraw.There is one question
I would like to ask the witness.That's a chain of office you're wearing.
May I see it?The Red Dragon.What's this?Sir Richard is appointed
Attorney General for Wales.For Wales.Why Richard, it profits a man nothing
to give his soul for the whole world.But for Wales.My lords! I've done.The jury will retire
and consider the evidence.Considering the evidence, it shouldn't
be necessary for them to retire.Is it necessary?Then is the prisoner
guilty or not guilty?Guilty, my lord!Sir Thomas More, you have been
found guilty of high treason.- The sentence of the court...
- My lords!When I was practicing the law,
the manner was to ask the prisoner...before pronouncing sentence,
if he had anything to say.Have you anything to say?Yes.Since the court has determined
to condemn me...God knoweth how...I will now discharge my mind...concerning the indictment
and the King's title.The indictment is grounded
in an act of parliament...which is directly repugnant...to the law of God and His Holy Church.The supreme government of which
no temper able person...may by any law presume to take upon him.This was granted...by the mouth...of our Savior, Christ Himself...to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome
whilst He lived...and was personally present...here on earth.It is therefore insufficient in law...to charge any Christian to obey it.And more than this...the immunity of the Church is promised
both in Magna Carta...and in the King's own coronation oath.Now, we plainly see you are malicious!Not so.I am the King's true subject...and I pray for him and all the realm.I do none harm.I say none harm.I think none harm.And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive...then in good faith, I long not to live.Nevertheless...it is not for the supremacy
that you have sought my blood...but because I would not bend
to the marriage!You have been found guilty
of high treason.The sentence of the court
is that you be taken...to the Tower of London...until the day hence
to the appointment...for your execution!I am commanded
by the King to be brief...and since I am
the King's obedient subject...brief I will be.I die His Majesty's good servant...but God's first.I forgive you, right readily.Be not afraid of your office.You send me to God.You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?He will not refuse one who is so blithe
to go to him.Thomas More's head was stuck
on Traitor's Gate for a month.Then his daughter, Margaret,
removed it and kept it 'til her death.Cromwell was beheaded for high treason
five years after More.The Archbishop was burned at the stake.The Duke of Norfolk should have
been executed for high treason...but the King died of syphilis
the night before.Richard Rich became
Chancellor of England...and died in his bed."
Driving Miss Daisy|1989|81|Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman, Dan Aykroyd, Patti LuPone|Bruce Beresford|"I'm gone to the market, Idella.Pepsodent's new improved formula
cleans teeth whiter than ever.Are you all right, Miss Daisy?That's good!You two get back to work.- Mama!
- No!It's a miracle you're not laying at
Emory Hospital or the funeral parlor.Cucumbers are pretty this summer.You didn't even break your glasses.It was the car's fault!- You had the car in the wrong gear.
- I did not!Idella, want a pickle with lunch?Not me.I'm putting up a jar for
you to take home to William.You backed the car into
the Pollack's yard.You should have let me keep my Lasalle.
It wouldn't have behaved this way.Mama, cars don't behave.
They are behaved upon.You demolished that
Chrysler by yourself.Think what you want.
I know the truth.The truth is you just cost
the insurance company $2,700.You are a terrible risk.Nobody will issue you a policy now.You're just saying that to be hateful.Okay. Yes, I am!
I am making it all up.Look out on the driveway!Every insurance company in
America is out there......waving their pens
to get you to sign up.If you're going to stand in my pantry
and lie like a rug, go somewhere else.I better get back to the office.Florine will have a fit if I don't
get home on time tonight.You all must have plans tonight.The Ansleys' dinner party.This is her idea of heaven on earth.What?Socializing with Episcopalians.You are a doodle, Mama!I'll stop by tomorrow evening.How do you know I'll be here?I'm not dependent on you for company.Fine, I'll call first.But you know, we have got some
real serious talking to do.No!I need you now. I have to be at
the beauty shop in half an hour.No, I most certainly did not know you
had to call a minimum of 2 hours ahead.Why call yourself a taxicab company
if you can't provide taxicabs?Why don't you call your son?
He'd send someone to carry you.That won't be necessary.I'll cancel the appointment
and fix my own hair.Sometimes I think you ain't
got the sense God gave a lemon.Two dots. I want that!And a five bamboo.Well, this is not my day for mah-jongg.Nine bam!Thank you all for coming here again.
I am a real pariah without my car.Oh, nonsense!When do you get the new one?I don't know! Boolie's
being real pokey about it.I'll come after you for temple tomorrow.That's sweet of you, honey.Mama, you there?It's just us!Why didn't you call?We can't stay.So I gather.The Millers are giving a hay ride.I had these made.
Doesn't your baby look cute?Well, it's not exactly
the word I'd pick.New Graham Greene?
I been wanting to read that.Sorry, but it's due back
at the library tomorrow.- Want me to return it for you?
- No, thank you.I'll go to the library on the streetcar.Damn it, Mama! Quit being so stubborn.
You know perfectly well...Go on! Don't keep the horses waiting.Bye!Is that door making contact?Oscar?I'm here.- Are you all right?
- No, sir, I'm stuck.I know. Fiddle with the lever.It fiddled out. I done all I know how.Call Bell Elevator.I already did. They're
backed up until around 1:00.Did you tell them it's an emergency!You don't have to holler, Mr. Werthan.I did not break the elevator.Got that stuff for Davis & Paxon?Wrapped and ready to go!I promised it for today.
Call Bell again.I hear you.Look up where the gate is supposed
to close. See a do-hickey?Wait a minute.Right here!Reach up and mash it
up until it catches.I done it. Now what?Operate the lever.Do you work here?No, sir. This here Hoke.Hoke Colburn, sir.How'd you know about the elevator?I used to drive for a dairy, sir.Their elevator was
worse than this one.Hoke the one I told you about.Of course.Excuse me, sir.Y'all people's Jewish, ain't you?Yeah, we are. Why?I'd rather work for Jews.I know folks say they stingy and cheap.But don't say none of that around me!Good to know you feel that way.What was your last job?I worked for Judge Harold
Stone, a Jewish gentleman.You worked for Judge Stone?Seven years. I'd still be
there if he didn't up and die.Mrs. Stone asked me to move
to Savannah with her.Of course, my wife was dead by then.But I said, ""No, thank you, ma'am.""I didn't want to be too
far from my grandbabies.Judge Stone was my father's friend.You don't say?Sit.Later, Miss McClatchey.Oscar said you needed somebody
to drive for your family.Will I be taking your
children to school......and your wife to the beauty parlor?I don't have any children.
What I need...You're still a young man.
Don't worry too much.Thank you. I won't.Hoke, I need somebody
to drive my mother around.Yes. Well, if you don't
mind my asking, sir......why ain't she hiring for herself?It's a difficult situation.She done gone around the bend a little.That will happen as they get on.No, she's all there!Too much there is the problem!I want you to understand something.My mother is a little high strung.The fact is, you would
be working for me.She can say anything she likes......but she can't fire you. Understand?Yes, sir.Yes, sir, I sure do.Don't worry, Mr. Werthan.I'll hold on no matter
which way she run me.I was a little boy back on the farm
above Macon where I come from.I wrestled hogs to the
ground during killing time.Well, sir, there ain't a
hog got away from me yet!How are you, Idella?Living.- Where's the new vacuum cleaner?
- In the closet.She won't touch it.It gives me a shock
every time I'm near it.It works for me.Good! Then you clean and I'll
go down and run your office.Where's Mama?Up yonder.I guess you know who this is.I'll be right back.I wouldn't be in your shoes......if the sweet Lord Jesus came
down and asked me Himself.Good morning, Mama.Just come down and say hello.You listen here.Unless they rewrote the Constitution
and didn't tell me, I still have rights!Of course.What I do not want, and absolutely
will not have, is......some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,
gobbling my food, using my phone.I hate that in my house.You have Idella.Idella's different!
She's been coming to me for years.We stay out of each other's way.Even so, there are chips
in my wedding china.You think Idella has a vendetta
against your wedding china?Don't be sassy.When we couldn't afford them,
we did for ourselves.That's still the best way.""Them?"" ""Afford them?""
You sound like Governor Talmadge.What a thing to say!
I'm not prejudiced!Aren't you ashamed?!You might as well make the best of it.I knew a Miss Idella once.
Back down in Macon.You don't say?She sang!What are you talking about?I'm talking about this
woman had some lungs!She'd be a whole church
choir by herself!I declare!Fat, too!She was as big as that stove!Don't talk to Idella!
She has work to do.What are you doing?Dusting the bulbs, Miss Daisy.That's the silliest thing I ever saw.Who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty?Get down from there!Put that ladder away
before somebody trips.I'm gone, Miss Daisy.All right, Idella. See you tomorrow.- I'm going too, Miss Daisy.
- Good.Good morning, Miss Daisy.
Thought I'd see after your zinnias.Leave me flower bed alone.You got a nice piece of ground behind
the garage that ain't doing nothing.I could put in tomatoes...If I want a vegetable garden,
I'll plant it myself.What are you doing?I just love a house with
pictures, Miss Daisy.It do make a home.I don't want you nosing
through my things.Good morning, Miss Daisy.It was right cold in the night.I wouldn't know. I was asleep.Idella says we're
running short on coffee......and Dutch cleanser.We are?Yes, ma'am.We're low on silver polish, too.I know.I'm fixing to go to the
Piggly Wiggly on the trolley.On the trolley!
Why don't you let me carry you?No, thank you.Ain't that why Mr. Werthan hired me?That's his problem.All right. But I'm going to
find something to do here.You leave my things alone!I'm gone to the market, Idella.Miss Daisy, it's a shame.You have this fine Hudson
automobile out there in the garage.It hasn't moved an inch from
when Mr. Werthan drove it here.That insurance company gave you
a brand new car for nothing.That's your opinion.My other opinion is that a fine rich,
Jewish lady like yourself......has no business dragging herself
onto a trolley carrying grocery bags.I'll carry them for you.I don't need you!I don't want you!
And don't say I'm rich!- I won't say it no more.
- Is that what you and Idella talk about?I hate being discussed behind
my back in my own house!I was born on Forsyth Street.Believe me. I know
the value of a penny!My brother brought
home a white cat once.We couldn't keep it because
we couldn't afford to feed it!My sister saved up money......so I could become a teacher!
We had nothing!But you're doing all right now!What are you doing?!I'm trying to drive you to the store!Where are you off to this
morning, Miss Werthan?Just a little shopping.Go away! I've ridden the trolley
with the groceries plenty of times!But I can't keep taking
Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing.How much he pay you?Miss Daisy, that's between him and me.Anything over $7 a week
is highway robbery!You sure are right about that!Especially since I don't do nothing......but sit on a stool all day.All right!Piggly Wiggly.Then home. Nowhere else.Oh, I just love the smell of a new car.Don't you, Miss Daisy?I am nobody's fool, Hoke.I know!My husband taught me to run a car.I remember everything he said.So don't think even for a second you...Wait. You're speeding.I can see it!We only going 19 miles an hour.I like to go under the speed limit.But the speed limit is 35 here.The slower you go the more gas you save.My husband taught me that!Ain't hardly moving.
Might as well walk......to Piggly Wiggly.Is this your car?No.Do you pay for the gas?- No.
- All right, then!My son thinks I'm losing my abilities......but I am still in control
of what goes on in my car!Where are you going?To the store, like you said.Why didn't you turn on Highland?Piggly Wiggly ain't on Highland.I know where it is!
Now take Highland Avenue.- That's 3 blocks out of the way.
- Go back this minute!- I can't turn now.
- I've been driving to Piggly Wiggly......since it opened for business.
This isn't the way!Go back this minute!Miss Daisy, look. Yonder
is the Piggly Wiggly. See?Get ready to turn.Careful. There's a little girl.Yes, I see her.Pull in here.Wait.Give me the keys.Stay right here by the car.And don't tell everyone my business.Mr. Werthan?Yes, sir, it's me! Guess where I'm at.I just drove your mama to the store!You know, she flapped around some,
but she's all right. She's in the store.Oh, Lord, she just looked
out the window and seen me.She'll probably throw a fit right
there at the check-out counter.Yes, sir. You are right about that.
It only took me 6 days.Same time it took the
Lord to make the world.Yes, sir. All right. 'Bye.Hey Oscar, Junior. How you
old boys doing today?How the lady been treating you?I'll tell you one thing;
she knows how to throw a fit.What's so funny?Nothing, Miss Daisy.
We just carrying on.Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning
here for 15 years. Never carried on before!Leave them alone.Put your coat on.
We're late.Idella, I'm gone now.I'm right behind her.Hear, oh Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one.Such a nice man. And such a good,
short sermon, wasn't it?I can get it myself!Hurry out of here!Is something wrong, Miss Daisy?Something I done?Yes.I haven't done anything.You parked the car right in front of the
temple, like I was the Queen of Romania.Everybody saw you!I said to wait for me in back.Yes, Ma'am, but I was just trying to...There were two chauffeurs
right behind me.You made me look like a fool.
A g.d. fool!Oh, Miss Daisy, Lord
knows you ain't no fool!Slow down!Miriam and Beulah, I could see what
they were thinking when we came out.What's that?That I was pretending to be rich!- You is rich.
- No, I'm not!Nobody can say I put on airs.On Forsyth Street we made many
meals of grits and gravy.I have done without plenty of times.Miss Daisy, if I was to ever
get my hands on what you got......shoot, I'd shake it around
for everyone in the world to see.That's vulgar! Don't talk to me!Never understand some white folks.What was that?! I heard that!Now, Miss Daisy...
you needs a chauffeur......and Lord knows I need a job.So why don't we just leave it at that?Good morning, Mama.
What's the matter?No, I don't always think
something's wrong when you call.Just when you call so early.What?!All right. I'll be there
as soon as I can.I better get on over there.'Bye.Come on.It's not healthy to rush like this.I eat too much, anyway.Besides, it sounds like she needs me.When doesn't it?
Give Mother Werthan my love.Coffee, Katie Bell!I didn't expect to
find you in one piece.I wanted you to be here
when he comes.I wanted you to hear it
for yourself.What is going on?He's stealing from me.Hoke? Are you sure?I don't make empty accusations.
I have proof!This! I found it hidden in the
garbage under some coffee grounds.- He stole a can of salmon?
- Here it is!I knew there was something funny.They all take things, you know.
So I counted.The silverware first.Then the linen napkins.
And then I went into the pantry.And the first thing that
caught my eye was a hole......behind the lima beans.And I knew right away.There are only 8 cans of salmon.
I had 9!3 for $1 on sale.Very clever, Mama.I missed my breakfast and
I'm late to a meeting......for a 33c can of salmon?You want 33c? Here's $1!Here's $10! Buy yourself
a pantry full of salmon!Why, Boolie, the idea!Waving money at me like that!I don't want money.
I want my things!- One can of salmon?
- Well, it was mine!I leave him plenty of food every day.I tell him exactly what it is.Like children. If they want
something, they just take it!He'll never admit this.""No,"" he'll say, ""I don't
know nothing about that!""I don't like it! I don't
like living with no privacy.Go ahead, defend him.
You always do!I give up! You want to drive again,
arrange your own insurance.Take the trolley.Buy yourself a taxicab!
Anything you want!Just leave me out of it!Why, Boolie!What's he doing here
this time of morning?Can't be good, I promise you that!I think it's fixing to
clear up out there!Excuse me, Mr. Werthan.
Y'all busy?We have to have a little talk, Hoke.All right, just let me
get out of my coat.Yesterday, while you were out,
I ate a can of your salmon.Now I know you said to eat
the leftover pork chops.Well, they were kind of stiff.So, I stopped by the Piggly
Wiggly and got you another can.Do you want me to put it on the shelf?Yes, thank you, Hoke.Be right with you, Mr. Werthan.Well, I got to get dressed now.Good-bye, son.You know, Miss Daisy,
I was just thinking.We been out to this cemetery
3 times this month already.It ain't even the 20th yet.It's good to come in nice weather.Yes, ma'am. You sure
right about that. Sure is.Mr. Sig's grave is mighty well tended.I think you're the best widow
in the State of Georgia.Boolie's always pestering me to have
the staff here tend to this plot.""Perpetual care,"" they call it.Well, don't you do it!It's right to have member of
the family looking after you.I'll never have that! Boolie will have
me in perpetual care before I'm cold.Miss Daisy, you ought to
go on away from here!Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave.Leo Bauer. Is that Miss
Rose Bauer's husband?She asked me to bring it out here.Where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?I'm not exactly sure. I know
it's two rows over that way.You'll see the headstone, ""Bauer.""What's wrong?Nothing wrong.
Nothing the matter at all.Now, you say...I told you it's two rows over that way.
It says ""Bauer"" on the headstone.What that look like?What are you talking about?I'm talking about I can't read, ma'am.What?!I can't read, Miss Daisy.You look at the paper all the time.Well, that's just it. I just be looking!I try to dope out what's going on......from the pictures.You know your letters?Yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's.
I just can't read.Stop saying that!
You're making me mad!If you know letters, then you can read.You just don't know you can read.I taught some of the stupidest
children God ever put on this earth.And they all could read enough
to find a name on a tombstone.The name is ""Bauer.""""Bauer!"" What does that ""buh""
letter sound like?- B?
- Of course!""Er."" That is the last part. ""Bauer!""What letter sounds like ""er""?R!- So the first letter is...
- B!And the last letter?R!B-R. Brr.It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!- That it?
- That's it.- What about the middle?
- Not right now.This will be enough for you to find it.B at the beginning.R at the end.B... R.That's it.That's all right!I sure do appreciate this!Don't be ridiculous!Let's get all this back in the car.
I'm burning up.Of course I told you!Of course I told you!How can I be expected to buy it
if you don't write it down?!I'm sorry, Miss Florine.I need you.I'll be right there.Do you have any idea what it takes
to give a Christmas reception?It takes an eye for detail.I told you a million times,
Katie Bell, write it down!More I cannot do!We are out of coconut.I'm sure we can manage.- I told her.
- You didn't write it down!I don't need to stand and
listen to excuses on Christmas.You figure out how to serve ambrosia to
50 people without coconut. I give up!Don't worry, Katie Bell.
It's not quite the end of the world.Everybody's giving the Georgia
Power Company a merry Christmas.Bet Miss Florine beat them all,
especially with the new house.Absurd!If I had a nose like Florine, I wouldn't
say, ""Merry Christmas"" to anybody.I enjoy Christmas at their house.No wonder. You're the
only Christian in the place.They got that new cook.Florine never could keep help.
Of course, it's none of my affair.Too much running around.
The Garden Club this......the Junior League that.
As if they'd give her the time of day.She'd die before she'd fix a glass of
iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood.I hope she doesn't take it into
her head to sing this year.Lord have mercy!
Look what Miss Florine done.If her grandfather, old man
Frietag, could see this.What is it you say?I bet he'd jump out of his
grave and snatch her baldheaded.Jump up and snatch her baldheaded.Oh, Miss Daisy, you
go on away from here.Wait a minute.This isn't a Christmas present.You know I don't give
Christmas presents.I happened to run
across it this morning.Well, go on, open it.Look at that.Ain't nobody never gave
me no book before.""Zaner Method Writing.""I always taught out of these.
I saved a few.It's faded, but it works.If you practice, you'll write nicely.But you have to practice.I taught Mayor Hartsfield
out of the same book.I sure do thank you.It's not a Christmas present.Jews have no business
giving Christmas presents.You don't have to go yapping
about this to Boolie or Florine.This is between you and me.Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan.I hope I don't spit up.Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke.She fought me on this one.But it is time for a trade.I'll bet you'll miss the old one.No, sir, I don't expect
I'll miss it that much.Come on, you're the only one
who's driven it all this time.Won't you be a little
sorry to see it go?It ain't going nowhere.
I done bought it.You didn't.I sure did. Already made the
deal with Mr. Red Mitchell.How much?That is for him and me to know.Hey, Boolie!Got a gem here.Got that paper, Hoke?I got it right here.Be right there.Why didn't you buy it from Mama?
Would have saved money.No, sir. Your mama is in my
business enough as it is.I ain't studying about making
monthly payments to her.She is mine the regular way.The Hudson's a good car.Nobody knows that better than you.Best that ever come off the line.And this here new one, if Miss
Daisy don't take to it......l'll let her ride in this one.Mighty nice of you.We do what we can.It is three after seven.Yes, Ma'am. You said we were
leaving at fifteen to eight.At the latest, I said.What business you got dragging this
mess out of the house by yourself?Who was here to help me?Lord have mercy!It don't take more than 5
minutes to load this car.You're fixing to break your arms and
your legs before we even leave the manor.You're taking on too much.I hate doing things at the last minute.What you talking about?
Been ready to go for a week and a half.- Give me that package.
- No, don't touch that.It sure is pretty.
Is that Mr. Walter's present?Yes. It's fragile.
I'll put it on the seat.You nearly missed us.You were leaving at quarter of.- She's taking on.
- Be still!Florine bought this for Uncle Walter.Mama, it's not a snake!I think it's notepaper.How appropriate.
Uncle Walter can't see.Maybe it's soap.How nice that you take an interest
in your uncle's 90th birthday.Don't start up with me, mama......I can't go
to Mobile with you.I have to go to New York
for a convention.The convention starts Monday.And I know what else I know.Leave Florine out of this.
She ordered those tickets 8 months ago.I'm sure ""My Fair Lady"" is more
important than your relatives.Those Christians will be impressed.I can't talk to you
when you're like this.- We're expected in Mobile for supper.
- You'll be there.- How will you stand her all day?
- They'll fix crab. All that trouble.She's just worked up.Here's $50 in case you have trouble.Don't show it to Mama!- Have you got a map?
- She's got it in the back seat.It's 7:16!You should have a job on the
radio announcing the time.- I want to miss rush hour.
- You will.Congratulate Uncle Walter for me
and kiss everybody in Mobile.The air conditioning......did you check it, like I said?I got the air conditioning checked.I don't know why.
You never let me turn it on!Hush up!Good luck!Good God!Turn left.No, right! Turn right!Did I ever tell you about the
first time I left Georgia?When was that?A few minutes back!Go on!My daughter......is married to a Pullman porter.She is always on the go.New York, Detroit, St. Lois.I say, ""That's all well
and good, Tommie Lee......but I don't feel the need for it.""So here it is.The first time.And I might tell you, Miss Daisy......Alabama is not
looking like much so far!Idella sure does stuff eggs good!You stuff yourself good.I was thinking about the
first time I went to Mobile.It was Walter's wedding: 1888.1888! You were nothing
but a little bitty thing.I was 12.We went on the train.Oh, I was so excited.I'd never been in a wedding party.I had never seen the ocean.Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico, not
the ocean, but it was all the same to me.I asked Papa if it was all right
for me to dip my hand in the water.And he laughed because I was so timid.And then I tasted the
salt water on my fingers.Isn't that a silly thing to remember?No sillier than most of
what folks remember.Boy!What are you doing with this car?This is my car, officer.Can I see your registration,
please, and your license, boy.What's this name? Wertheran?Werthan.Never heard that one.
What is it?It is of German derivation.German derivation.Thank you, ma'am.An old nigger and an old Jew woman
riding down the road together.Now that is one sorry sight.Oh, my God!The sign says Phenix City 30 miles.We're not supposed to go to
Phenix City! Oh, my God!Maybe you read it wrong.I didn't. Stop the car. Stop the car!Lord have mercy.Here. You took the
wrong turn at Opelika.You took it with me, Miss Daisy.
And you got the map.I was getting the lunch!
Go on back. My God!It aint' more than 30
minutes since we turned.They fixed crab for me.Minnie always fixes crab.
They go to so much trouble.It's all ruined by now.We going to have to pull over.What's wrong with the car?There ain't nothing wrong with the car.I got to be excused.I got to go make water.You should have thought of
that at the service station.You know colored can't use the toilet
at any service station, Miss Daisy.There's no time to stop.
We'll be in Mobile soon. You can wait.No, ma'am.- I told you to wait!
- I heard what you said.How do you think I feel having to
ask you can I go make water......like I am some child.I'd be ashamed.I ain't no child, Miss Daisy.And I ain't just a back of the neck you
look at while you go where you got to go.I am a man. I'm near 70 years old.
And I know when my bladder's full.Now I'm going to get out of this car......and go over there
and do what I got to do.And I'm taking the key with me, too.
Now that's all there is to it!Hoke!Hoke!Hoke?You all right, Miss Daisy?Of course I am.Is that you, Slick? It's Boolie.
How you doing?Congratulations on your dad's big day.Thank you, Boolie. Thank you.
Aunt Daisy!It's Boolie on the phone.Hey, son!Uncle Walter appreciates your call.I don't think he can come to the phone.Fine. How's Hoke?What do you mean?
How should he be?Happy birthday, Uncle Walter.I got to hang up now, Boolie.Yeah, I'll tell him.For he's a jolly good fellow.Which nobody can deny!Morning, Miss McClatchey.Well, good morning to you.Can I see him?It's Mr. Sinclair Harris, sir.My cousin Sinclair?His wife... The one that talk funny.She's from Canton, Ohio.She's trying to hire me.- What?!
- Yes, sir. She said:""How they treating you
down there, Hoke?""You know how she sound,
like her nose stuffed up.So I said, ""Fine, Mrs. Harris,
just fine, thank you.""She said, ""Well, you looking for
a change, you know who to call.""I'll be damned!I thought you ought to know about it.I'll be goddamned.Ain't she a mess?Said, ""Name your own salary.""I see. And did you?Did I what?- Name your own salary?
- Go away. What you think I am?I ain't studying working for
no trashy something like her.But she got you thinking, didn't she?Well, sir, you might say that.Name your salary.That's exactly what she said.Well, how does $65 a week sound?Sounds pretty good, sir.Course, $75 sounds better.It sure does!Beginning this week.That's mighty nice of you.I sure appreciate this. Thank you.You ever have folks fighting over you?No.It sure feels good.One dot.Nine dot.Two dot.Mah jongg.You are the luckiest thing, Beulah!Excuse me.I don't know how you can look at that.See it a few times, you get in it.Both your brains are
fixing to evaporate.You can bring the cake now, Hoke.Don't make a mess with those peas.Do I ever?Lord have mercy, look at that.
Ain't she got a lot of hair?How she get it so shiny?Washes it in mayonnaise.- Go on away from here, Idella!
- Yes, she did.I read it in Life magazine.Don't seem human, does it?He will tear you to shreds!I am not going into that court.
And I'm not giving in!You are at the end of your rope.You murdered Carlson.
You have to pay!Either choose the easy way out,
or you go into the courtroom......and let them carve you
into pathetic little bits.You have a minute to make up your mind.What happened? She up to
something, ain't she?- You fixing to ruin it.
- What are you talking about?You got the chicken too close
together and the fire is too high.Mind your business.It's your chicken.Thank you, Hoke.Now you enjoy it.Amen.Who is it?Morning, Miss Daisy.What in the world...?I learned how to drive on ice when
I delivered milk for the dairy.Ain't nothing to it.Other folks are banging into each
other like they're in the funny papers.I figured your stove was out, so
I stopped by the Krispy Kreme.I know you got to have
coffee in the morning.How sweet of you, Hoke.We ain't had any good coffee
around here since Idella passed.I can fix her biscuits.We both can make her fried chicken.But nobody can make Idella's coffee.Ain't that the truth?Idella was lucky.I expect she was.Where are you going?I'm just going to take these things off.I don't know what you can do here
today, except keep me company.Then I'll see if I can make us a fire.Eat anything you want
out of the ice box.It will all spoil, anyway.And wipe up what you
tracked onto my floor.What do you think I am, a mess?Mama, I'll be right out......when I can get down my own driveway.Stay home, Boolie.
Hoke is here with me.How'd he manage that?He's very handy. I'm fine.
I don't need a thing in the world.Hello? I have the wrong number.
Mama's saying loving things about Hoke.I didn't say I love him.
I said he was handy.Honestly! Are you trying to irritate
me in the middle of an ice storm?Thank you, Wellborn.Thank you all.I am deeply grateful to be
chosen 1966 Man of the Year......by the Atlanta Business Council.An honor I've seen bestowed
on mighty fine fellows.And one I never expected
would come to me.I'm afraid that my loss up here......and my gain down here......have given me an air of
competence that I don't possess.I will tell you that I wish my father
and grandfather could see this.About 72 years ago, they leased
an old mill up on Decatur Road......with I believe 25 looms in operation.They managed to grow with Atlanta.And Werthan Industries believes that
what we want is what Atlanta wants.And this award proves
that we were right.I thank you.Well?What is it? What took you so long?I couldn't help it.
There's a big mess up yonder.What's the matter? I might as
well not go to temple at all!No, ma'am, you ain't going to get to
the temple this morning, Miss Daisy.Why not? What's the matter with you?Somebody has bombed the temple.What? Bombed the temple?That's how come
we stuck here so long.I don't believe it!That's what the policeman just said.Oh, my God. Was anybody there?
Were people hurt?I don't know. He didn't say.Who would do such a thing?You know good as me, Miss Daisy.
It always be the same ones.I remember one time back
down there in Macon.Lord, I couldn't've been more than
10 or 11 years old, I reckon.I had this friend named Porter.One day there his daddy
was hanging from a tree.Now just the day before, we'd
all been pitching horseshoes.Laughing and carrying on and
talking about how me and Porter......was going to have strong
right arms, just like him.Lord, there he was.
Hanging up yonder in the tree.Had his hand tied behind him.
Flies was all over him.I tell you, I threw up
where I was standing.You go on and cry.I'm not crying.Why did you tell me that story?Lord, I don't know, Miss Daisy.That mess back there
put me in mind of it.Ridiculous! The temple
has nothing to do with it!Yes, ma'am, if you say so.We don't know. Maybe that
policeman wasn't telling the truth.Why would he go and lie
about a thing like that?You never get things right!Miss Daisy, somebody done bombed
that temple and you know it!I don't want to hear anymore about it!- You the boss.
- Don't talk to me!- Where are you?
- Up here!Hello, Mama. How are you feeling?Not a good question to
ask somebody nearly 90!Well, you look fine.It's my ageless appeal!Miss McClatchey gave me your message.Florine is invited, too.Thank you.I guess Hoke should drive us.
There'll be a crowd.Mama, we have to talk about this.About what?About the feasibility of all this.I believe Martin Luther King has
done some mighty fine things.If you don't want to go,
why don't you just say so?I want to go! You know
how I feel about him.Of course, but Florine...Florine has nothing to do with it.
I still have to do business here.I see. Werthan Bag will go out of
business if you attend the King dinner.Not exactly. But a lot of men I do
business with would not like it!They might......snicker a little.Call me Martin Luther
Werthan behind my back.Maybe I wouldn't hear
about meetings at the Club.Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills, he's a
New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew.All the really smart ones come
from New York, don't they?Some might throw their business to Jack
instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.I don't know.
Maybe it wouldn't happen.And sometimes that's
the way things work.Anyway, if we don't use those
seats, somebody else will.If we do not use those seats?
I'm not supposed to go, either?You can do whatever you want.Thanks for your permission.Can I ask you something?When did you get so fired up about
Martin Luther King?Why, Boolie!I've never been prejudiced
in my life and you know it.Then ask Hoke to go with you.Don't be ridiculous. He wouldn't go.Ask him and see.All right!Boolie said the silliest
thing the other day.What did he say?He was talking about Martin Luther Ling.I guess you know him, don't you?King? No, ma'am.
I don't know him.I was sure you did.But you've heard him preach?Yes, Ma'am, same way you have.
On the TV.I think he's wonderful.- What you getting at?
- It's so silly.Boolie says you wanted to go with me
to this dinner. Did you tell him that?No, I didn't.I didn't think so. What'd be the point?
You can hear him whenever you want.I think it's wonderful the
way things are changing.Now what you think
I am, Miss Daisy?What do you mean?The invitation to this dinner......came in the mail a month ago.Now, if did be you wanted
me to go with you......how come you wait 'till we in the
car on the way before you asked me?What? All I said was Boolie
said you wanted to go.Next time you want me to go
somewhere ask me regular.You don't have to carry on so much.Let's just leave it alone.Honestly!Talk about things changing.
They ain't changed all that much.I'll help you.Thank you, Hoke, I can help myself....can see that the South
has marvelous possibilities.Yet in spite of these assets......segregation has placed the South......socially, educationally, and
economically behind the rest of the nation.Yet there are in the white South
millions of people of good will......whose voices are yet unheard......whose course is yet unclear......and whose courageous
acts are yet unseen.These millions are called upon......to gird their courage,
to speak out......to offer leadership that is needed.History will have to record......that the greatest tragedy of
this period of social transition......was not the vitriolic words and the
violent actions of the bad people......but the appalling silence and
indifference of the good people.And our generation
will have to repent......not only for the words and acts
of the children of darkness......but also for the fears and
apathy of the children of light.Morning, Miss Daisy.Miss Daisy?Hoke, is that Hoke?It's me. You all right?Hoke, what did I do with my papers?My papers! I had them all
corrected last night......and I put them where I wouldn't
forget them on my way to school.What did you do with them?What are you talking about?The children will be disappointed if
I don't give them their homework.I always give it back the next day.That's why they like me.You talking out your head.Why aren't you helping me?What'll I do?Find those papers. I told you.It's all right if you moved them.
I won't be mad.But I've got to get to school.
I'll be late.Who will take care of my class?
They'll be all alone. Oh, God!I do everything wrong!Now set down in here. You're
going to fall and hurt yourself.I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.
I didn't do right.It's so awful!Ain't nothing awful except
the way you carrying on.It's all my fault.I can't find the papers.
The children are waiting.There ain't nobody waiting on you.
You ain't a teacher.It doesn't make any difference.Now listen, there ain't
nothing wrong with you!You don't know.This Hoke here.What can I do for you?It's your mama.What's wrong?She's taking on something awful.Why's today different
from any other day?No, sir. It's not the same.I'll be right there.Miss Daisy, now there ain't
nothing wrong with you!Your mind done took a turn this morning.You'll snap back if you let yourself.I can't! I can't!You're a lucky old woman.No! It's all a mess now, and
I can't do anything about it.Now look at you. You rich,
you well for your time.You got folks who care
what happens to you.I am being trouble. I don't
want to be trouble to anybody.You want something to cry about,
I'll run you to the state home......let you see what's laying out there.I bet there ain't one of them
carrying on the way you doing.I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Those poor children.You keep this up and Mr. Werthan's
going to call that doctor on you.Just as sure as you born, that doctor is
going to have you out in that asylum.Now is that the way you want it to be?Do you still have that Hudson?You talking about from
when I first come here?No, Miss Daisy.That thing been in the junkyard now...
more than 15 years.I'm driving your next to last car now.1965 Cadillac.It's running fine as wine, too.You ought not to be driving
anything the way you see.Now, how you know how I can see
'less'n you can look out my eyes.You're my best friend.- Go on now, Miss Daisy.
- No, really.You are.You are.Well, Hoke, good to see you!- You didn't drive yourself here?
- No, sir. I don't drive now.My granddaughter drove me.My Lord, is she old enough to drive?Michelle is nigh on 37 years old now.She's teaching biology at
yonder Spelman College.I never knew that.Seems mighty funny to sell the
house while Mama's still alive.Yes, sir, I imagine it do.But she hasn't been inside
the door for two years.I know.I suppose you don't see her very much.No, sir, I don't.It's hard, not driving, Mr. Werthan.There's no bus that goes out yonder.Course, I take a taxicab
as often as I can.I' m sure she appreciates it.Some days she's better than others.But then, who ain't?Happy Thanksgiving, Mama!Look who I brought!Morning, Miss Daisy.You been keeping yourself busy?She certainly has.
She goes to jewelry making...How many times a week?She makes all kinds of things.
Pins, bracelets...She's a regular Tiffany's.Isn't that something!Are you all right, Mama?Hoke, I thought of you the other day.- I saw an Avondale milk truck.
- Is that right?A big monster of a thing.
Must've had 16 wheels.Go on away from here.I wondered how you'd have

I'm most awfully sorry about</i>
<i>your cold and the general dreariness.</i><i>We're also having</i>
<i>quite bad weather here, too.</i><i>Thanks for your letters.</i>
<i>I'm sorry you and Pa are disappointed...</i><i>I should be letting the Olympic Games</i>
<i>interfere with my shorthand.</i><i>But if you were my age, with a chance</i>
<i>to win the World Championship in Paris...</i><i>you would be just as big a fool as I am.</i><i>By the way, it's awfully kind of Pa</i>
<i>to finance me here, in spite of my idiocy.</i><i>It's marvellous for esprit de corps.</i>
<i>Most of the chaps have managed to get down.</i>- Cricket, Montague, in the ballroom.
- Now!No ball!Come on, Aubrey, the old leg break.- Howzat!
- Not out.What? You could hear it
in bloody Bournemouth!- Come on, Liddell, my innings.
- I didn't touch it.- You heard the crack of my wrist.
- I saw the bloody thing bend!
- Andy!No tickle for me.He's out, I tell you.
You're all deaf and bloody blind.Aubrey, I ask you, for God's sake!It's not fair!All right.<i>Harold's here. As intense as ever.</i><i>Just as he was</i>
<i>on our very first day at Cambridge.</i><i>I remember we shared a taxi together.</i>I'll take these.- See you inside, Aubrey.
- Right.Thank you.- Name, please.
- We're new.I can see that, laddie. What's your name?Abrahams. HM.- Top of the list. Repton. That the one?
- That's it. Left a year ago.- Been doing your bit, 'ave you? France?
- No. Joined too late.Bad luck, lad.Many a dead man
would have liked a share of it.You're right there, son.Welcome to Caius.- Sign here.
- Thank you.It's across the courtyard,
top right-hand corner, up the stairs.Thanks.By the way, what are your names?Rogers, head porter,
and this is Mr Ratcliffe, my assistant.Well, Mr Rogers, Ratcliffe...I ceased to be a ""laddie"" when
I took up the King's commission.- Is that clear?
- Yes... Mr Abrahams.- Quite clear.
- Thank you.I'd be obliged if you'd remember it.- See you later.
- Fine.What's your friend studying, then, son?Barrack-room law?I've no idea.One thing's certain.A name like Abrahams, he won't be
in the chapel choir, now, will he?- Name?
- Montague.- What?
- Montague.I take the war list...and I run down it.Name after name which I cannot read...and which we, who are older than you...cannot hear, without emotion.Names which will be only names to you...the new college.But which to us summon up face after face...full of honesty and goodness...zeal and vigour...and intellectual promise.The flower of a generation.The glory of England...and they died for England...and all that England stands for.And now by tragic necessity,
their dreams have become yours.Let me exhort you. Examine yourselves.Let each of you discover...where your true chance of greatness lies.For their sakes...for the sake of your college
and your country, seize this chance.Rejoice in it...and let no power or persuasion
deter you in your task.<i>Thursday, October 10th, 1919.</i><i>My first day at Cambridge was rounded off...</i><i>by the freshmen's dinner,</i>
<i>a sumptuous affair.</i><i>The master gave us a moving speech...</i><i>and I'm now eagerly awaiting</i>
<i>the start of term proper.</i>Rugby club, golfing society, tennis...squash club, flora and fauna, philately.Is that all? You're an idle man!- I've got to work some time.
- Try bird-watching. You can take a book.How can I watch if I'm reading a book?Follow in the footsteps of WG.
Any Yorkshiremen here?I can't bat for toffee.âª Upon the battle sceneâª They fight the foe togetherâª There every mother's sonâª Prepared to fight or fall isâª The enemy of one the enemy of all isâª The enemy of one the enemy of all is- Abrahams, HM.
- Can you manage a tenor?- We're desperately short of tenors.
- Only under torture.- Aubrey. Sing, do you?
- School choir, that's all.You, Stallard?They kicked me out of <i>Ring-a-ring o'Roses.</i>Sorry about that. We can't all be gifted.âª If everybody's somebodyâª Then no one's anybody- Put my friend here down as well.
- Steady on.Splendid! Rehearsals start on Monday.
<i>Iolanthe.</i>- I was a boy alto.
- Perfect! You can be Queen of the Fairies.Where were you
when your country needed you?We have a duty, a solemn duty, to those
millions of lives needlessly slaughtered!âª When the boys are far awayâª They dream of homeWell, glad to have you, Stallard.Good middle-distance men
don't grow on trees.I can't vouch for those times.Taken with the school alarm clock,
most of them.Give or take a second,
they're good enough for me.Have you come across a fellow
called Abrahams? HM Abrahams?He's challenged for the college dash.What's so special about that?In all the 700 years, nobody's ever done it.Right, what do you do?Right, chaps, thank you! Thank you.Let it be known that HM Abrahams
of Gonville and Caius...has formally made challenge
for the college dash.You show 'em, Harold!For those not familiar with the rules...The challenger will attempt
to run around the court perimeter...to and from a point beneath the clock...within the time taken
by the clock to strike midday.A distance traditionally
recognised as one of 188 paces.I say, Abrahams, what have you got
on your feet? Rockets?The challenge will commence on the...- Abrahams, you haven't got a chance!
- Do it for Israel!The challenge commences
on the stroke of one.The challenger must finish
before the stroke of 12.Come on, Abrahams, you swank!Will the challenger make himself ready?This Abrahams.
What do you know about him?Repton chap.Jewish.- His father's a financier in the city.
- Financier?What's that supposed to mean, I wonder?I imagine he lends money.Exactly.And what do they say about the son?Academically sound. Arrogant.Defensive to the point of pugnacity.Mm. As they invariably are.Yet possessing
a keen sense of duty and loyalty.Do they say he can run?Like the wind.Gentlemen, would you draw back, please?
Away from the course.Thank you.Mr Abrahams, your position, please.Owing to the absence
of any other challenger...Mr Abrahams will run alone.Not so, Mr Starter!Your name and college, if you please, sir.Lindsay. I race beside my friend here.We challenge in the name
of Repton, Eton and Caius.<i>- I didn't know you ran.</i>
- Nor I you.Some chap just told me about this.
I thought I'd come and push you along.- Delighted.
- Splendid.Good luck.Gentlemen, to your marks, if you please.Now remember, on the first strike of 12.Come on!<i>Eight!</i>Nine!Ten!- <i>Eleven!</i>
- Go on! Go on!Did they both do it?I think not.- Young Lindsay failed by a whisker.
- Pity.<i>Well, it's been done.</i>
<i>And by a Caius man! You must be very proud.</i><i>The first man in seven centuries.</i><i>Perhaps they really are</i>
<i>God's chosen people, after all.</i><i>I doubt if there's a swifter man</i>
<i>in the kingdom.</i>Get to your marks.Get set.<i>He may be your best friend, Sandy,</i>
<i>but he's my best brother.</i><i>I'm thinking of him</i>
<i>and not your blessed athletics team.</i><i>His heart's set on following Father</i>
<i>in the mission.</i>Do you not think he's busy enough
without taking up racing?He's fast, Jennie.
You've seen him with a ball in his hands.I've seen him with a Bible in his hands.And I know which is the most important.You can't deny him the chance.Get him on the track, I'm telling you...Don't tell me, Sandy. I don't want to hear.Eric's special to me. Precious.I don't want his work spoilt
with all this running talk, do you hear?There you are. Well done.You know, ladies and gentlemen...one of the compensations
of achieving a certain notoriety...if only as a rugby player...is that occasionally
you're asked to give things away.It's often said that giving beats receiving.Let me tell you...the look of delight
on those little boys' faces...was worth ten of the tin pots gathering
dust on my Edinburgh sideboard.When we were in China, my father here...was always waxing lyrical
about his wee home in the glen.But being oriental-born myself...like my brothers and my sister here...I suffered from a natural incredulity.But looking about me now...the heather on the hills...I can see he was right.It's very special.Thank you for welcoming us home.And thank you...for reminding me that I am,
and will be whilst I breathe...a Scot.Mr Provost, sir.Before you allow Eric here to go...Is it not true that the main event
of the meeting is still to be run?<i>It is. Aye.</i>The 200-yards open championship.It's the last event
of this gathering, by tradition.Do you not think,
if we can find him some kit...we might persuade Scotland's
finest wing to show us his paces?What do you say, Eric?<i>To your marks!</i>Get set!Didn't I tell you, Eric? Didn't I tell you?Surely a touch of liberality
would do no harm.Sandy, the kingdom of God
is not a democracy.The Lord never seeks re-election.There's no discussion, no deliberation...no referenda as to which road to take.There's one right, one wrong...one absolute ruler.- A dictator, you mean.
- Aye, but a benign, loving dictator.So much for your freedom of choice.<i>You've still got a choice, Sandy.</i>Nobody's forcing you to follow it.Hey, hey!- Do you know what day it is?
- Yeah.- Tell me, then.
- Sunday.The Sabbath's not a day
for playing football, is it?No.- Are you up early in the morning?
- Me ma gets me up at seven.We'll have a game then, then. OK?Mr Liddell, is it OK if me da comes?Sure. Bring your whole family.I'll give ye a five-goal start.You've got a train to catch at nine.There's plenty of time.Do you want the kid to grow up
thinking God's a spoilsport?If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.To the Liddell family...whom I'm fortunate enough
to call my friends.The Reverend JD, Mrs L, young Ernest.<i>Bon voyage and safe journey back to China.</i>May the years ahead be happy and content.For those who remain,
may God protect them...inspire them...and lead them to glory.Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice.I'm relying on you now
to keep them all out of mischief.That I will, Mrs L. If they do transgress,
I'll pop the details on a postcard.You can read all about it
before you can say Marco Polo.Cost you a fortune in postage stamps.Don't worry. I shall protect my investment.I'm going to rule you with a rod of iron.We're going to have to watch ourselves!You're a very lucky young man, Eric.You're the proud possessor of many gifts.And it's your sacred duty
to put them to good use.Dad's right. Run like we know you can,
strong and true.The mission cannot but gain
by your success.What we need now is a muscular Christian.To make folks sit up and notice.How good are you, Eric?Sandy reckons he'll run for Scotland
before the month's out.Then after that... the sky's the limit.Meaning what?The Olympic Games, maybe?Eric, you can praise the Lord
by peeling a spud...if you peel it to perfection.Don't compromise.
Compromise is a language of the devil.Run in God's name...<i>and let the world stand back in wonder.</i>âª Lean and his mercy will provideâª Trust and thy trusting soul shall proveâª Christ is its life and Christ its loveâª <i>Run the straight race</i>âª <i>Through God's good grace</i>âª <i>Lift up thine eyes</i>âª <i>And seek his face</i>âª <i>Life with its way before us lies</i>You came to see a race today.To see someone win.It happened to be me.But I want you to do more
than just watch a race.I want you to take part in it.I want to compare faith to running in a race.It's hard.It requires concentration of will.Energy of soul.You experience elation...when the winner breaks the tape...especially if you've got a bet on it.But how long does that last?You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt.Maybe you haven't got a job.So who am I to say believe...have faith, in the face of life's realities?I would like to give you
something more permanent...but I can only point the way.I have no formula for winning the race.Everyone runs in her own way...or his own way.And where does the power come from
to see the race to its end?From within.Jesus said...""Behold, the kingdom of God is within you.""""If with all your hearts ye truly seek me...ye shall ever surely find me.""If you commit yourself...to the love of Christ...then <i>that is how you run a straight race.</i>Cheers. Thanks for coming.It's an ache.A helplessness.And an anger.One feels humiliated.Sometimes I say to myself,
""Steady on, you're imagining all this.""Then I catch that look again.Catch it on the edge of a remark.Feel a cold reluctance in a handshake.That's my father.A Lithuanian Jew.He <i>is alien.</i>- He's as foreign as a frankfurter.
- A kosher one at that!I love and admire him.He worships this country.From nothing, he built what he believed...was enough to make
true Englishmen of his sons.My brother's a doctor.A leader in his field.- Which one is he?
- That's me with the curls, on his back.He wanted for nothing.And here am I.<i>Setting up shop</i>
<i>in the finest university in the land.</i>But the old man forgot one thing.This England of his is Christian...and Anglo-Saxon.And so are her corridors of power.And those who stalk them
guard them with jealousy and venom.You're right to study law.
You're quite an advocate.A rare ethnic advantage.
It's called the gift of the gab.So what now? Grin and bear it?No, Aubrey.I'm going to take them on. All of them.One by one.And run them off their feet.âª <i>He is an Englishman!</i>âª <i>He is an Englishman</i>âª <i>For he himself has said it</i>âª <i>And it's greatly to his credit</i>âª <i>That he is an Englishman</i><i>England beckons for sprint blue.</i><i>From a special correspondent.</i><i>Clean sweep for Cambridge star.</i><i>Abrahams hat trick.</i><i>From a special correspondent.</i>âª <i>But in spite of all temptations</i>âª <i>To belong to other nations</i>âª <i>He remains an Englishman</i>âª <i>He remains an</i>âª <i>Englishman</i>âª <i>For in spite of all temptations</i>âª <i>To belong to other nations</i>âª <i>He remains an Englishman</i>âª He remains anâª EnglishmanBravo!Bravo, Harold!âª L'Ã©tendard sanglant est levÃ©âª L'Ã©tendard sanglant est levÃ©âª Entendez-vous dans les campagnesâª Contre nous de la tyrannieâª L'Ã©tendard sanglant est levÃ©âª L'Ã©tendard sanglant est levÃ©âª Entendez-vous dans les campagnes4-1 Liddell!

<i>- Bonjour.</i>- How's the leg?
- OK.Nasty fall you took.<i>EnchantÃ©. Good luck.</i>You're very welcome here, of course.But we do have a strict amateur code.Colonel, don't worry your head.I'm here spectating, that's all.Good. I felt sure you would understand.Well, to battle!I hope you enjoy the games.Games? You must be joking.I've seen better-organised riots.Come on, Scotland!<i>Vive la France!</i>Gentlemen, get to your marks.Get set.Get up, lad. Get up.<i>Yeah.</i>He'll never do it.Don't you believe it. His head's not back yet.Come on, Eric!Get back! Give him air!Well done, Eric, son. Well done.He'll be right in a jiffy.
I'll go away and get his clothes.You take good care
of this lad o' yours, Mr McGrath.Because if you drop him,
you'll never find another one like this.It's not the prettiest quarter
I've ever seen, Mr Liddell.But certainly the bravest.Get him up. Come on, gently.Keep your arm around.Mr Mussabini.Mr Abrahams, is it?So you've travelled 300 mile just to see me?You and Liddell.I'd heard you were both the best.And what do you think now?Eric Liddell?I've never seen such drive,
such commitment in a runner.He runs like a wild animal.He unnerves me.So he should.He frightens the living daylights out of me.I want you to help me take him on.Tell me, Mr Abrahams. Are you married?No. Why?Well...when the right girl comes along...how will you feel if she pops the question?You see, Mr Abrahams...like the bridegroom...it's the coach that should do the asking.Mr Mussabini...I can run fast.With your help, I think I can run even faster.Perhaps faster than any man ever ran.I want that Olympic medal.Now, I can see it there.It's waiting for me.But I can't get it on my own.Well, we've an old saying in my game, son.You can't put in what God's left out.Now, you leave it to me.I'll watch you. I'll observe.
And if I think I can help...if I can see the big prize hanging there...believe me, I won't waste any time.When we meet again...I'll be the one that does the begging.So you will watch me?Son, if you're good enough...I'll take you apart piece by bloody piece.Thank you.âª Three little maids who, all unwaryâª Come from a ladies' seminaryâª Freed from its genius tutelaryâª Three little maids from schoolâª Three little maids from schoolâª One little maid is a bride, Yum-Yumâª Two little maids in attendance comeâª Three little maids is the total sumâª Three little maids from schoolâª From three little maids, take one awayâª Two little maids remain and theyâª Won't have to wait very long, they sayâª Three little maids from schoolâª Three little maids from schoolâª Three little maids who, all unwaryâª Come from a ladies' seminaryâª Freed from its genius tutelaryâª Three little maids from school- Didn't I tell you?

but I am enjoying it.- And you, JB?
- I've done better shows myself.- Do you remember them offhand?
<i>- I don't!</i>So the stone heart's frail after all.- Abrahams is smitten, you say?
- Smitten? He's decapitated.- He won't listen to reason.
- The poor lad's in love!He's only just set eyes on her.
I've worshipped her for years.- By the way, where is he now?
- He's gone to ask her out to dinner.- Has he, by Jove!
- In the interval?!- Thank you. Mine, I take it?
- Harold.Lovely.Well?- Well what?
- Did you speak to her?Yes.- Is she coming?
- Yes.- To dinner?
- Yes.Her kid brother is athletics-mad.
Always talking about me!Monty, you'd better have my glass.
I've a terrible feeling you're going to need it.Sorry, Monty.Yes, thank you very much, sir.Yes, of course I will, sir.Good evening, Miss Gordon!A triumph, I hear.Who was that chap over there?Music critic of the <i>Star.</i>- Boring old buffer, really.
- Well, he obviously enjoyed it.I shouldn't think so.They always say that.
They save the poison for the print.- A bit off tonight, I thought.
- What? You were magnificent!Thank you.One of my little maids has gone and
got herself preggers with a gondolier.We had to shove her second on tonight.
The trio...- Your usual, Miss Gordon?
- Thank you, Toffy.And you, sir.Thank you.This is Mr Abrahams.
He's a very famous runner.He's trying your special
for the first time tonight.- I hope you enjoy it, sir.
- I'm sure I shall.Well, go on then!It's a secret concoction of Toffy's...a sort of cocktail <i>de maison...</i>so you'd jolly well better enjoy it.- Excellent.
- There, Toffy!You've won yourself a friend for life.My favourite, please.- For two.
- My pleasure.What have I ordered?Surprise.- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.Well... the great Harold Abrahams.My brother will be insanely jealous.So will mine.You don't look very ruthless.Should I?According to my brother.
Tim says that's why you always win.- Why running?
- Why singing?It's my job.No, that's silly. I do it because I love it.Do you love running?I'm more of an addict.
It's a compulsion. A weapon.- Against what?
- Being Jewish, I suppose.You're not serious?!You're not Jewish...or you wouldn't ask.Fiddlesticks!People don't care.Anyway, being Jewish
hasn't done you any harm.I'm what I call semi-deprived.That sounds clever. What does it mean?It means they lead me to water,
but they won't let me drink.You're a funny old stick,
Mr Harold Abrahams.Funny...but fascinating.I'll settle for the fascinating.Life isn't that gloomy, is it?Not tonight.You're so beautiful.Like you.<i>Le pied de porc anglais, madame.</i>Pigs' trotters.Oh, my God.<i>The train arriving at platform two...</i><i>is the Flying Scotsman from Aberdeen.</i>7.30, Mr Liddell! 7.30 on t'dot.There you are, sir. Hot tea and toast.Great.- You sleep all right?
- Like a log.Aye. Must have a clear conscience.Far from it.- Are we here?
- Aye, sir. Just pulled in. King's Cross.Oh, and here's the paper, with your picture in.Expecting great things, from all accounts.Are they indeed?- Here you are.
- Much obliged, sir.Now, no hurry. You've got
an hour before we kick you out.- And good luck for this afternoon.
- Thank you.Come on, sir. Wake up. King's Cross.Aye, Mr Abrahams. So's the Scot.Mr Abrahams?Mr Liddell.I'd like to wish you the best of success.Thank you. And may the best man win.<i>Get to your marks.</i>Get set.Extraordinary.<i>Harold.</i>Harold.This is absolutely ridiculous.It's a race you've lost, not a relative.
Nobody's dead.For goodness' sake, snap out of it, Harold.
You're behaving like a child.- I lost.
- I know!I was there, remember? Watching.It was marvellous.You were marvellous.He was more marvellous, that's all.On the day, the best man won.I had to look for him.It's absolutely fundamental. You never look.He was ahead. There was nothing you
could have done. He won fair and square.Well, that's that, Abrahams.If you can't take a beating, it's for the best.I don't run to take beatings!I run to win.If I can't win, I won't run.If you don't run, you can't win.Ring me when you've sorted that one out.Sybil...Don't go.I just don't know what to do.Try growing up.Harold.You're a great man.You ran like a god.I was proud of you. Don't make me ashamed.It's not the losing, Syb.Eric Liddell's a fine man and a fine runner.It's me!After all that work...now, God knows, what do I aim for?Beating him the next time.Sybil, I can't run any faster.<i>Mr Abrahams!</i>Mr Abrahams!I can find you another two yards.<i>Charlie Paddock.</i>Californian cannonball.
World's fastest human.Winner, 100 metres, Olympic Games...- 1920, Antwerp. Time?
- 10.3.Jackson Scholz...the New York Thunderbolt.Runner-up, Olympic Games, 1920.Lost by looking right.Look, here's the finish. You see?Paddock, leaping past him at the tape?That glance cost Scholz the race.- Scholz's fastest?
- 10.3... 4.Eric Liddell. Well, you know all about him.Look at them.Think them. Breathe them.I want their faces leering at you
every time you shut your eyes.The Flying Scotsman first.
That bloody well hurt.What, Eric Liddell?Well, he's no real problem.He's a great runner
but he needs to go further out.- He's no 100-metres man.
- He could have fooled me!Yeah, he's fast.But he won't go any faster, not in
the dash, anyway. He's a gut runner.He's all heart. Digs deep.A short sprint is run on nerves.- It's tailor-made for neurotics.
- Thanks very much.No, I mean it. You can push guts,
bully them, but you can hone nerves.Paddock, Scholz and Eric Liddell.Come here a minute, Mr Abrahams.Now, do you know
why you lost the other day?Because you're overstriding.Just a couple of inches. Now...These coins represent the strides
in your hundred metres.Have you got another two coins,
Mr Abrahams?Well, maybe we can find them.As I said...overstriding.Death to the sprinter.Slap in the face each stride you take.Knocks you back.Like that. Like that...and that!Now...I want you to imagine
you're running on hot bricks.If you leave your feet too long
on the ground, they'll get burnt.Up, up, up. Light, light, light!
Light as a feather.Set!No! Not your head back again!Get it level! Go and do it again.That's it!Faster, come on!Pass the car! Go on!Go on! Go on!Go on, go on, on, on!Come on, now! Keep it up, come on!Rhythm, Mr Abrahams, rhythm!<i>Training, training. All I ever hear is training.</i><i>Do you believe in</i>
<i>what we're doing here or not?</i>Look, Jennie, I'm sorry.I was late. I apologise.- It's all very well, Eric.
- Look, I said I was sorry.To me. It's not me you've insulted.Away with your bother!The Lord'll not feel slighted
at the missing of a bus.Yes, Eric, you missed a bus. But why?Your mind's not with us any more, son.It's full of running and starting
and medals and pace.It's so full of it,
you've no room for standing still.Jennie, Jennie, Jennie!Don't fret yourself.I do fret myself, Eric.I'm frightened for you.I'm frightened for what it all might do to you.<i>Please, Mr Liddell.</i>
Would you sign your name, please?Surely.You want to pick yourself a pen?- There you are.
- Thanks.Come on, Jennie, let's go for a walk.
I've got something to say.It's a sight and a half, in't it, Jennie?Auld Reekie. I'll be sad to leave it.I've decided.I'm going back to China.The missionary service have accepted me.Oh, I'm so pleased!But I've got a lot of running to do first.Jennie...Jennie, you've got to understand.I believe that God made me for a purpose.For China.But he also made me fast.And when I run... I feel his pleasure.To give it up would be
to hold him in contempt.You were right.It's not just fun.To win is to honour him.Jennie...Jennie.I've got my degree to get.All that work.Then there's Paris.The Olympic Games.There's just not enough of me.I'm asking you to manage
the mission on your own...till then.Will you do that for me, Jennie?<i>Andy, I've lost him.</i>Can't reach him.<i>You will, old girl. You will.</i>He says he needs to clear his mind of me.He can't love me and say that.Syb.The world's against him, or so he believes.Now he's got a chance to prove himself.He can't see or hear anything
beyond that, not even you.It's hard, I know,
but you've just got to try and understand.- Why should I?
- Because he's what you want, isn't he?What about you?And Stallard and Aubrey?You're still the same.
The chance is there for you too.To be <i>a fastest, yes, but not the fastest.</i>The fastest man ever before.Father's never going to learn how to do that.That's immortality.Just think what it means to a man like Harold.Well, to me the whole thing's fun.
I don't need that.""Cast care aside"" and all that.But for Harold, it's a matter of life and death.- So all I can do is wait?
- 'Fraid so.And pray like hell that he wins!And if he doesn't?You mustn't worry, old thing.I've never ever seen a man
so smitten as our Harold.It's just that I'm a little envious, that's all.Oh, Andy.- Your parasol, Miss Gordon.
- Thank you, Mildred.Good luck tonight.He's a damned fool!I always thought the Irish had all the luck!- John, Savoy Theatre.
- Yes, sir.Splendid.Mildred, would you get my spikes?Ready, my lord!Now, Coote, if I shed a drop I want to know.Touch but not spill, what?<i>Life slips by, Abrahams.</i><i>Life slips by.</i>But this fine old university of ours,
she offers some rare consolations.Beyond measure, sir.I can take it, then, that you would
be acutely grieved to discover...that any behaviour or action
on your part were causing her grief?Naturally, sir. I would, deeply.Good. I was sure of it.Here in Cambridge, we've always
been proud of our athletic prowess.We believe, we've always believed,
that our games are indispensable...in helping to complete
the education of an Englishman.They create character.They foster courage, honesty and leadership.But most of all,
an unassailable spirit of loyalty...comradeship and mutual responsibility.- Would you agree?
- Yes, sir. I would.I'm afraid there is a growing suspicion
in the bosom of this university...and I tell you this without in any way...decrying your achievements,
in which we all rejoice...that in your enthusiasm for success...you have perhaps lost sight
of some of these ideals.May I ask what form
this disloyalty, this betrayal, takes?- Oh, hardly betrayal!
- The word grief was mentioned.It's said that you use a personal coach.Mr Mussabini, yes.- Is he Italian?
- Of Italian extraction, yes.- I see.
- But not all Italian.- I'm relieved to hear it.
- He's half Arab!Do we take it that you employ this
Mr Mussabini on a professional basis?Sam Mussabini is the finest,
most advanced...clearest-thinking athletics coach
in the country.I'm honoured to be worthy of his attention.Nevertheless, he's a professional.What else would he be? He's the best.But there, Mr Abrahams,
I'm afraid our paths diverge.You see, this university believes
that the way of the amateur...is the only one to provide
satisfactory results.I am an amateur.You're being trained by a professional.You've adopted a professional attitude.For the past year, you have concentrated
on developing your own technique...in the headlong pursuit,
may I suggest, of individual glory.Not a policy very conducive to
the fostering of <i>esprit de corps.</i>I am a Cambridge man first and last.I am an Englishman first and last.What I have achieved, what I intend
to achieve, is for my family...my university and my country.And I bitterly resent
your suggesting otherwise.Your aim is to win at all costs, is it not?At all costs, no.
But I do aim to win within the rules.Perhaps you would rather
I played the gentleman and lost?To playing the tradesman, yes.My dear boy, your approach has been,
if I may say so, a little too plebeian.You are the elite...and are therefore expected
to behave as such.Thank you, sir...for your hospitality.The evening has been most illuminating.Good night to you, sir.You know, gentlemen...you yearn for victory, just as I do.But achieved with
the apparent effortlessness of gods.Yours are the archaic values
of the prep school playground.You deceive no one but yourselves.I believe in the pursuit of excellence...and I'll carry the future with <i>me.</i>Well, there goes your Semite, Hugh.A different god.A different mountain top.<i>Harold! Harold! We're in.</i>All of us!
You, Henry, Andy and me, we're all in!You 100 and 200, Andy 400 and hurdles...Henry the mile, and me the steeplechase.Paris, here we come!Eric Liddell's picked too.Rivals under the same flag.Your chance to get even, eh?I can't wait.Welcome to Dover, my Lord Birkenhead.Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...that they'll wipe the floor with our boys?It's certainly true that
the Americans have prepared seriously...some would say too seriously,
to gain success.But we feel we may, in our
unsophisticated way, have their match.Sir, do you think
the British team stand a chance...against such great American athletes
as Charlie Paddock and Jackson Scholz?You Americans have a number of men
who are rated as world-beaters...but this contest is in Europe,
not in the rarefied climes of the United States.Parisian conditions are bound
to be more robust...more combative and certainly more cavalier.Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...that they will wipe the floor with our boys?Gentlemen, Abrahams, Liddell and Lindsay...We have the men who could
give them a run for their money.Eric!Sandy! You haven't come all the way
from Scotland just to see me off, have you?I have not. I'm seeing myself off.Come on, or we'll miss the boat.Hey, Mr Liddell! What do you think
of your chances against Abrahams?I'll do my best. Can do no less.Mr Liddell, sir!What about the qualifying heats on Sunday?- What did you say?
- On Sunday!Do you think you can beat the Americans?There's Mr Abrahams! There he is!- Mr Abrahams!
- Sorry, I've no time...Hello, Jeremy.- Gilbert and Sullivan will win.
- Thanks very much.- Harold!
- Sybil.- I came to wish you luck.
- I'm glad.I understand. I wanted you to know that.I'll be here when you come back.<i>Hurry along, Mr Abrahams.</i>
She's about to sail!I must go. I'll see you in three weeks.Bye-bye.Mind your step, sir.
We want you to get there in one piece.- When did you get to know?
- Did you not read the papers this morning?The heats for the 100 are on
the Sunday after the opening ceremony...the semis and final a couple of days after.It's only a heat.Does it make all that difference?Yeah.Yeah, it does.And strong though the temptation may be...to disport your newly acquired finery
around the streets of Paris...if they aren't temptation enough...may I ask you on behalf
of the Olympic Committee...to save your sartorial splendour...until at least after the opening ceremony.May I remind you...you are the favoured few.You constitute what is without doubt...the most powerful athletic force
ever to leave these shores.You are to face the world's best...brown and yellow, white and black...young and ardent as yourselves...fleet of foot and strong of limb...from every civilised nation
on the face of the earth.I have no doubt...that you will acquit yourselves
honourably and... with distinction.Good luck to you all.<i>Your mind's not with us any more.</i><i>It's full of sprinting and starting</i>

<i>- Yeah. Sunday.</i><i>The Sabbath's not a day</i>
<i>for playing football, is it?</i><i>It's an awful step you're taking, Liddell.</i><i>The whole of Britain will be watching you.</i>I don't know that they'll understand.I'm not sure that <i>I understand.</i>I'm not sure that I do either, sir.For the last three years
I've devoted myself to my running...just to be on this ship.I gave up my rugby.My work has suffered.And I've deeply hurt someone
I hold very dear.Because I told myself...if I win, I win for God.And now I find myself sitting here,
destroying it all.But I have to.To run would be against God's law.I was mistaken.My boy - as things stand, you must not run.But I want you
to hold your fire for a while, Liddell.Leave everything to me.Say nothing. Wait until we get to Paris.I'll have a word with the French.I'm not without a certain pull...and we fought in the war together.They do owe us something.I don't understand.They're not a very principled lot, the Frogs.But, when faced with a stand like yours...one never knows.I might get through.I just might possibly persuade them.The French, sir?What can they do?Shift that bloody heat of yours, of course.Good evening.<i>Good night, sir.</i>âª With cat-like treadâª Upon our prey we stealâª In silence dreadâª Our cautious way we feelâª No sound at allâª We never speak a wordâª A fly's footfall would be distinctly heardâª Come friends, who plough the seaâª Truce to navigationâª Take another stationâª Let's vary piracyâª With a little burglary<i>I wish you could see, Ma, the</i>

- Good luck, Harry.Monty.<i>Silence! Û vos marques!</i><i>PrÃªt!</i>Your Royal Highness, may I introduce
Mr Tom Watson, representing New Zealand.How do you do? You've come a long way.I'm from Oxford, sir. They wrote to me.Said as I was over here,
I might as well take part.- Economical. But can you run?
- I'll give it a try, sir.- That's the spirit. Best of luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.The royal benediction, no less.- The chap's invaluable.
- Hear, hear! Henry V and all that.Protocol, Monty. Protocol.He's here to show us what may be done -
and more essentially, what may not be.Jackson Scholz. How do you do?I'm Eric Liddell.Well, we've heard a lot about you.Liddell!Excuse me.I was afraid you weren't here.I'm afraid I am, sir.Fine. Do you good.Take you out of yourself a bit.The Prince of Wales would like to meet you.No.No. No, sir.It wouldn't be right.Liddell... he is your future king.Are you refusing to shake his hand?Does your arrogance extend that far?My arrogance, sir, extends
just as far as my conscience demands.Fine.Then let's hope that's wise enough
to give you room for manoeuvre.All right, sir.Splendid. I'll take you to him now.Your Royal Highness,
may I present Mr Eric Liddell?Delighted, Liddell. Delighted.I saw you play for Scotland.
It depressed me no end.Ran in a couple of tries from your own half.I believe I did, sir, yes.Nice to have you on the same side at last.Excellent effort of Lindsay's, don't you think?- He did well, sir. He did indeed.
- An example to us all.Eric, may I introduce
His Grace the Duke of Sutherland...president of our Olympic Association?- How do you do?
- And our chairman, Lord Cadogan.<i>Have a seat.</i>Make yourself comfortable.Cigar?Oh, no, of course. You don't. Nor drink.Such is the resolution of the young man
you have before you, gentlemen.Lord Birkenhead has advised us
as to your attitude...towards your participation
in the 100-metres heats, Liddell.Or would your non-participation
be more accurate?It would, sir, yes.We were also consulted as to
how we should approach the French.Something we can't allow, going
cap in hand to the Frogs, of all people!Simply out of the question.A simple matter of national dignity.
Being a patriot, I'm sure you understand.I must say, sir,
I felt it was an impractical suggestion.Why didn't you damn well say so?As an athlete, you value economy of effort.I wanted to run.
I was desperate enough to try anything.Well, all that being understood...we decided to invite you in for a little chat...to see if there's any way
we can help resolve the situation.<i>There's only one solution. That's</i>
for this man to change his mind and run.<i>Don't state the obvious, Cadogan.</i>We've to explore ways in which we can help
this young man to reach that decision.I'm afraid there are no ways, sir.I won't run on the Sabbath and that's final.I intended to confirm this
with Lord Birkenhead tonight...even before you called me up
before this inquisition.Don't be impertinent.The impertinence lies with those who
seek to influence a man to deny his beliefs.On the contrary, Liddell.
We're appealing to your beliefs.In your country and your king.
Your loyalty to them.Hear, hear.
In my day, it was king first, God after.And the war to end wars
bitterly proved your point.God made countries. God makes kings...and the rules by which they govern.And those rules say that the Sabbath is his.And I for one intend to keep it that way.<i>Mr Liddell.</i>You're a child of your race... as I am.We share a common heritage,
a common bond, a common... loyalty.There are times when
we are asked to make sacrifices...in the name of that loyalty...and without them
our allegiance is worthless.As I see it, for you...this is such a time.Sir...God knows, I love my country.But I can't make that sacrifice.<i>Come in!</i>Your Royal Highness... Lord Lindsay.Your Highness, Cadogan, gentlemen.I do apologise for barging in like this.The fact is
I am fully aware of Eric's dilemma.I wondered if I could be so bold
as to suggest a possible solution.<i>Do.</i>Yes.Another day, another race.What the devil's that supposed to mean?It's quite simple as a matter of fact, sir.The 400 metres. It's on Thursday.I've already got my medal.So why don't you let Eric
take my place in the quarter?I think that's a splendid idea.Can we allow him to change events
at such short notice?That's a matter for the committee.We <i>are the committee.</i>I think it's a very good idea.David?All those in favour say aye.<i>Aye.</i>Liddell?- Andy, I...
- A pleasure, old chap.Just to see you run.Aye.<i>Well, that's settled.</i>A sticky moment, George.Thank God for Lindsay.
I thought the lad had us beaten.He did have us beaten, FE.- And thank God he did.
- I don't quite follow you.The lad, as you call him,
is a true man of principle...and a true athlete.His speed is a mere extension
of his life, its force.We sought to sever his running
from himself.For his country's sake, yes.No sake is worth that, FE.Least of all a guilty national pride.<i>""Lindsay makes way for Liddell.""</i>""400 metres for defecting Scot.""""'Smacks of fanaticism, ' says official.""""'Man of principle, ' says primate.""""We should be proud.""- So that's the Olympic Stadium.
- That's it, Sam.It's as good as being in there, isn't it?Better! Seeing as I'm <i>persona non grata.</i>Yeah.It's tiptop, Mr Abrahams.
You've done a grand job.If we don't win now, we never will.Have I got everything, Sam?
Everything you need?Er...Yes.All we need now is Sunday.<i>My text this afternoon</i>
is taken from Isaiah, chapter 40.Behold.The nations are as a drop in the bucket...<i>and are counted</i>
<i>as the small dust in the balance.</i><i>All nations before him are as nothing.</i>They are counted to him less than nothing...and vanity.He bringeth the princes to nothing.He maketh the judges of the earth as a vanity.Hast thou not known?<i>Hast thou not heard...</i><i>that the everlasting God, the Lord...</i><i>the creator of the ends of the earth...</i><i>fainteth not...</i><i>neither is weary?</i>Juvenile!Oldest con in the business.I know, Sam.He giveth power to the faint...and to them that have no strength...he increaseth might.<i>But they that wait upon the Lord...</i><i>shall renew their strength.</i><i>They shall mount up...</i>with wings, as eagles.<i>They shall run...</i><i>and not be weary.</i><i>They shall walk...</i><i>and not faint.</i><i>Do you remember when we first</i>
bumped into each other, old man?We shared a taxi, remember?You made me feel...an age old, burdened, sour...Even superior.That was <i>the miscalculation of my life.</i>You, Aubrey...are my most complete man.You're brave...compassionate...kind.A content man.That's your secret.Contentment.I'm 24 and I've never known it.I'm forever in pursuit and I don't
even know what it is I'm chasing.Aubrey, old chap, I'm scared.Sam and I, we've laboured,
rowed and bullied for this.Day in, day out.You've seen us -
chuckled over us, I'll be bound.Out in all weathers.Madmen.And for what?I was beaten out of sight in the 200.Then I let Paddock trick me in the semi.Now, in one hour's time,
I'll be out there again.I'll raise my eyes
and look down that corridor...four-feet wide with ten lonely seconds
to justify my whole existence.But will I?Aubrey, I've known the fear of losing.But now I'm almost too frightened to win.<i>Dear Mr Abrahams.</i><i>You must please pardon</i>
<i>my not coming to see you run...</i><i>much as I would like to do so.</i><i>However, I believe and hope you will win...</i><i>the 100 metres.</i><i>Go out determined to do your best.</i><i>And don't forget...</i><i>drop down at the first stride.</i><i>Get well warmed up...</i><i>and then let the gun release you.</i><i>I should use the springy old six-spike shoes.</i><i>All the best of luck.</i><i>From yours truly, Sam Mussabini.</i><i>PS. Please accept the charm.</i><i>My old father swore by it.</i>No regrets, Eric,
that you're not down there with them?Yeah.No doubts, though.Your Royal Highness, may I present
Mr Bowman of the United States?Mr Bowman.- Mr Murchison.

I believe you know.- Oh, yes, Mr Watson. How are you?
- Very well, sir.Good.- Mr Paddock.

- Don't worry.It's all right for you.
You haven't got a family to keep.I'll look after you.Here.- Huh?
- Take this guinea.Good night, Blackie.<i>Our hero, alas,
was always being exploited</i><i>by villains like Black George.</i><i>For a generous man
is merely a fool in the eyes of a thief.</i><i>- A sheep?
- Aye, sir, an entire sheep.</i>A fat animal,
enough to feed a village for a week.Hanging up in his cottage
as proud as a battle trophy.- This is a grave matter.
- A hanging matter.Sir, if I may speak on his behalf,
I'd like...Be silent.Are you guilty?I am... guilty.- Sir, forgive him.
- Be quiet, sir.<i>I have to do justice here.</i>You have committed a capital crime.The laws have provided
the most terrible penalty...to hang by your neck.But you have children.For their sake,
I shall only dismiss you my service.And may God have mercy on you.You're too lenient, Mr. Allworthy.Compassion is one thing, sir,
but justice is another.<i>Mr. Thwackum and Mr. Square

a sense of virtue and religion.</i><i>They had, however, a more aptpupil.</i><i>Soon after Tom had been found,</i><i>the squire's sister, Bridget,
married a Captain Blifil</i><i>and they had a son.</i><i>This young man
was quite different from Tom.</i><i>He was sober, discreet,
and pious beyond his age,</i><i>and the whole neighborhood
resounded in his praise.</i>You have only taught Tom to laugh
at whatever is decent and virtuous and right.- I've taught him religion.
- Mr. Thwackum.The word ""religion""
is as vague and uncertainas any in the English language.When I mention religion,
I mean the Christian religion.Not only the Christian religion,
but the Protestant religion.And not only the Protestant religion,
but the Church of England.I fear that Tom
is the embodiment of the old truththat foundlings
should be left to the parish.My dear tutors, I'm afraid neither of you
can touch his bastard's heart.<i>Neither, indeed.</i><i>But there was another who could.</i>- Tom.
- Mmm?- I want you to help me.
- How?I want you to get me a post, Tom.Uh-huh.Miss Western's come back from France
and'll be wanting a maid.I'll speak to her.Tom, you are kind to me.Miss Western's maid.Sophie Western! Miss Western!Why, Tom Jones!I've brought you a thrush.It's beautiful, Tom. How kind of you.Two years is a long time.Did they teach you London ways
and make a great lady of you?Most of the time I was in France.
My aunt took me there.Ooh-la!
Did you like France, Miss Western?<i>Mais oui, monsieur.
Je me suis trÃ¨s bien amusÃ©e, merci.</i><i>- Bon, bon.
- You haven't changed, Tom.</i>You've grown, Sophie.
Grown more beautiful than ever.Doesn't he sing beautifully?
I shall teach him some new songs.I doubt if an English bird
can learn French songs, Miss Western.You'll see.Your father asked us all to supper.I came early to ask if you could help Molly,
Black George's daughter.Oh, yes. Father told me the story.
He stole a sheep, didn't he?Black George is a poor man
with big, hungry daughters to feed.Most hungry. I can vouch for it.Well, I have a maid already, Tom,
but I'll see if I can do anything.Good, good, good.- Ah, welcome, neighbors!
- Ah, Squire!- Welcome, welcome.
- How nice to see you.Welcome, madam.- Where's the squire?
- Good day, Western, good day!Look! Tom's bought me a thrush!Oh, what a sweet little bird.His song is sweeter
than any tune of Mr. Handel's.Ah! Handel.Tom, thank you.- She'll dote on it well.
- Welcome home, Sophie.How lovely you're looking, child.- Aye, it's good to have her home.
- Good day, Miss Western.Let's all go in to dinner.- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my little bird.Don't worry, Sophie.
I'll get it back for you.- Tom.
- Ah, good lad, Tom.- Do be careful.
- Be careful, Tom. Tom, take care.- I'll wager he gets it!
- Take care.I am sorry to cause you this distress,
Miss Western.I did not think the bird would fly away.But still, I cannot help observing
that the idea of caged birdsis against the laws of nature.Don't you agree, Mr. Square?He's got him!Aah!Oh!He'll drown!- Quick, get him out!
- He's got the bird!- Help him, someone!
- I've got him!Come on, lad! Give me your hand!Damn me if I won't love the boy for this

should come a-courtin' to me,I couldn't give myself to him.No, Tom.Not for all the riches in the world,

you're in love with him.I assure you, ma'am, I'm not.If you were, I see no reason
that you should be ashamed of it.For he is certainly a handsome fellow.That he is, the most handsome man
I ever saw in my life.And as you say, ma'am, I don't know why
I should be ashamed of looking at him,even though he is my better.For gentlefolk are but
flesh and blood like us servants.I am an honest person's child,and my father and mother were married,which is more than some people can say,
as high as they hold their heads.Honor!My grandfather was a clergyman,and he would have been very angry

something very extraordinaryabout my niece Sophie lately?Tell me then, for you know

- Well, who else could there be?In this rude country society,
who else is of her class?'Fore George,nothing could lie handier together

to Mr. Allworthy...immediately.<i>I will propose it.</i>Ah! Saddle my horse!Well, Nephew, how do you feel
about this marriagebetween yourself and Sophie Western?I will do exactly as you wish, Uncle.Oh, come, sir.That is a cold answer when confronted
by the prospect of so beautiful a young lady.My dear Uncle,I am well aware of the many pleasures
of that noble institution, marriage,and I will gladly call upon the young ladyat any time that she will
be pleased to receive me.Good. You shall call upon her
this very afternoon.Sophie, dear,
what book is that you are reading?A sad one.- You blush, my dear Sophie.
- I have no thoughts to be ashamed of.Now, Sophie, you know how I love you.You know the easiness of my nature.I have not always been like this.I used to be thought cruel.
By the men, I mean.I was called the cruel Parthenissa.Now come, Sophie.
I have news that will delight you.News? What news, Aunt?This very afternoon your father
has arranged for you to receive your lover.My lover?He's coming?- This afternoon?
- Yes.And you're to put on all your best airs.Why, Aunt!You almost frighten me out of my senses.You will come to yourself again.
He's a charming young fellow.Dear, dear Aunt.I know none of such perfections.So brave and yet so gentle.
So handsome.What matters his being baseborn?Baseborn? What do you mean?Mr. Blifil baseborn?- Mr. Blifil?
- Mr. Blifil.Of whom else have we been talking?Why, Mr. Jones!Mr. Jones?Mr. Blifil!You can't be in earnest.Oh, then I am
the most unhappy woman alive.How can you think
of disgracing your familyby allying yourself to a...a bastard?Madam, you have extorted this from me.Whatever were my thoughts
of that poor, unhappy Mr. Jones,I had intended to carry them
to the grave.I would rather follow you to that gravethan see you disgrace us
by such a match.Yes! Yes! Yes!No, no, no, no, no!
I will not marry that idiot!To force me to do so
would be to kill me!Then die and be damned.Oh, damn me!What a misery it is to have daughters,when a man
has a good mare and dogs.Tom, that pig-headed hussy
dares to refuse to marry Mr. Blifil.I'll turn her penniless out of doors
if she doesn't.Go to her, lad,
and see what you can do.Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!Sophie!- Sophie!
- Sophie!Sophie!No! No! No, no! No!
You get... Let me...- Sophie!
- Brother!Brother! Brother!Sophie!Sophie?Sophie.Sophie, Sophie, shh.My dearest, promise me
you won't give yourself to Blifil.- Don't say that name to me.
- Tell me. Tell me I may hope.- Tom, you must go.
- Sophie, please.Or you'll be destroyed.The only destruction I fear
is the loss of my Sophie.I cannot part with you.Can't I make you understand,
you country clot?Tom Jones?Damnation!Where is he?
That parasite! That home-wrecker!Where is he?There they are! There!Ah!Tom, you must go. Quick, Tom, quick!Run, Tom, run!Tom!I'll get thee, if I hang for it!Tom, run!- Sophie, please! Sophie!
- Run!Brother, don't hurt her!You there! Allworthy!A fine piece of work you've done.What can be the matter, Mr. Western?My daughter has fallen in love
with your bastard.That's what comes of trying to
bring up a bastard like a gentlemanand let him go round visiting
to nice folks' houses.I'm sorry to hear you say this.A pox on your sorrow.I've lost my only daughter,my poor Sophie, the joy of my heart.Little did I think when I loved him
as a sportsmanthat he was all the while
a- poaching after my daughter.I wish you had not given him
so many opportunities with her.What the devil
did she have to do with him?He came a-hunting with me,
not a-courting to her.What are we to do, Mr. Western?Keep the rascal away from my house
until I lock the wench up.I'll make her marry Mr. Blifil here
if it's the last thing I do. Huh?I'll have no other son-in-law but you.So go to her, you jolly dog, you.I tell you, you shall have her.And as for that son of a whore Jones,if I catch him anywhere near my girl, I'll
qualify him to run for the gelding's plate.Come on, me Slouch. Come on!<i>Even the best ofhorsemen
should avoid the bottle.</i><i>However, the forces ofsobriety</i><i>were gathering in all their strength
against our hero.</i>We draw your attention
to the abominable behavior of Mr. Jones.He is a monster of depravityand should be expelled
from your house this instant.You let her out of her room
after I locked her in?Women are convinced by reason,
not by force.The English of which is,
I am in the wrong.As soon as she came back
to live with you, Brother,she imbibed these romantic notions.You don't imagine, do you,
that I taught her this thing.Your ignorance, Brother,as the great Milton says,almost subdues my patience.Damn Milton!If he had the impudence to be here
and say it to my face, I'd lend him a flick.Oh! Come on, my girl.He was, according to the vulgar phrase,
whistle-drunk.On the very day of your utmost danger,he filled the house
with riot and debauchery.And he even struck Master Blifil.How?Did he dare strike you?Oh, Uncle, I'm sure I've forgiven him
for that long ago.But the same eveningwe unluckily saw him...with a girl...in a manner not fit to be mentioned.Mr. Thwackum advanced to rebuke himwhen I'm sorry to say that
he fell upon the worthy manand beat him outrageously.Tell me, child.What objection can you have
to the young gentleman?A very solid objection, in my opinion.
I hate him.Well, I have known many couples
who have entirely disliked each otherlead very comfortable, genteel lives.Madam, I assure you,
I shall never marry a man I detest.I still believe the young man
to have a few redeeming graces.Some of the crimes you accuse him ofreally sprang from his mistaken compassion
for the gamekeeper and his family.Compassion, sir? Lust.All his gifts, his so-called generosity,were merely bribes
to debauch another innocent.As you know, the unfortunate Molly.Miss Sophie Western
will be the next to be undone.All this I would have revealed long agohad not Master Blifil begged me
to give him another chance.Send him to me.Tom, I have forgiven you
too often in the pastout of compassion for your youthand in hope of your improvement.You must leave my house forever.However, I have educated you
like my own childand would not turn you naked
into this world.Here is something which will
enable you, with industry,to get a good employment.Good-bye, Tom.- Ah, Boycett.
- Sir.Good-bye, sir.Stay, boy. Stay.Mr. Allworthy is very sensibleof the many advantages
of binding our two estates together.Indeed?I had not realized that Mr. Allworthy
was so interested in questions of property.Oh, he is.And you?I?Well, naturally,
my attentions are set constantlyon those most blissful and sanctified
pleasures of holy matrimony.Clandestine amours so soon, Mr. Blifil?I pray you, Aunt, excuse me.
I feel a little faint.The fox, Mr. Blifil. The fox.Tallyho!It is you who have taught her
disobedience, Brother.You are such a boor.Boar?I am no boar. No, nor an ass.Ah, more than gothic ignorance.As for your manners,
they deserve a cane.And yours I despise
as much as I do a fart.And as for your niece, I'm going to
lock her up in my tower this time.You'll do nothing of the sort!Honor, you must promise
to keep your word.I can't, madam. I'm frightened.
I can't. I'm frightened, madam.Ah!I got you, my girl!- Help!
- Come on!Come on! You won't get out this time,
I warrant you!<i>Our hero was now
on the road to London.</i><i>His first adventure

May I ask which way you're heading?We're going north
to fight for the Protestant cause.Against Prince Charles?Ah, those damned Scots
are already on their way to England.I've been walking all day and I'm very hungry.
May I buy something to eat and drink?- Right. Give him some.
- Thank you, Sergeant.- Good day, Captain.
- Good day.I perceive you are a gentleman.We shall be glad to welcome any such
into our company.- I'd be glad to march with you.
- Good.We shall be on the march in a short while.<i>There comes a time when men,
in a constant state ofreadiness for war,</i><i>will slip their leash</i><i>and fight like dogs.</i>Sergeant.I believe...that a man can fight for no nobler cause
than that of his religion.Hear, hear!I'd like to propose a toast
to the Protestant cause.To the Protestant cause.Smoke the prig out, Northerton.
Smoke him.Sir, were you ever at the university?Sir, so far from having been at university,
I was never at school.Me neither.I presumed, sir, from the information
of your great learning.Sir, it's as easy for a man not to have
been at school and know somethingas it is for a man to have been at school
and know nothing.Well said, young volunteer.Upon my word, Northerton,
you had better let him alone,or he'll prove too hard for you.Uh, give us a toast, young fellow.
Fill up his cup.Yes, sir.I would like to propose a toast...to the health, and bless the name...of Miss Sophie Western.- Sophie Western.
- Sophie Western?I knew one Sophie Western.Was lain with
by half the young fellows at Bath.Perhaps this is the same woman.Miss Western is a great lady
of fashion and fortune.Aye, so she is, so she is.Well, it's the same young lady.I'll lay half a dozen of burgundy
Tom French of our regimenthad her in the tavern at Bridge Street.Sophie Western!Sir!I can bear no jesting
with this lady's character.Jesting? Damn me if I was
ever more in earnest in my life.Tom French of our regiment had her
and her aunt together at Bath.I tell you you are
the most impudent rascal on earth!You've killed him, you swine!Zounds! I was but in jest with the fellow.I never heard of Miss Western before
in me life.Then you deserve to be hanged.You're under arrest.
Sergeant, take him away.Arrest him.<i>But a hero cannot be lost
until his tale is told.</i><i>For heaven be thanked,
we live in such an age</i><i>where no man dies for love

Mama.Shh, shh, shh.Shh. No.Come on, you. Come on. Get up.I can't afford for you
to lie here idle any longer.Get out, and follow
them rascally friends of yours.You soldiers call yourselves gentlemen.But it's we who have to pay for you
and keep you, too, for that matter.What are you talking about?That Lieutenant Northerton
escaped last night.The rest of the company
went in pursuit after him.And they very conveniently left here
without paying the bill.Well, how could he have escaped?His doxy arrived,
a trollop called Mrs. Waters.The sentry had disappeared,
and she let him out.She'll soon learn
what kind of a man he is.Nothing is ever good enough
for sparks like him.But when it comes to paying the bill,
that's another matter.Don't worry, madam.
I will repay you handsomely.Ooh.Ah, sir,
a nice young gentleman like yourselfshouldn't want to get mixed up
with them rough soldiers.- It's gone.
- What's gone?I had a Â£500 note in my breeches pocket,
and it's gone.That's a likely story.- I had Â£500.
- You never had Â£500.One single note of Â£500 I had when
I arrived here yesterday, and it's gone!I should have known your kind
when you walked in here.Somebody's been in this room during the night
and taken Â£500 out of my breeches pocket!- Why don't you join them rascals?
- Was it you?Did you see her take it in the night?
Somebody took the Â£500 out of my breeches!You lying rascal!Nor them cheating
redcoat friends of yours neither.Go on, take your things
and get out of here quick!Go on.I'll set the dogs on you
if you don't hurry up!Ya blackguard! Robbers!
The whole lot of you! You and your Â£500!Wake up, you country stewpot!Your daughter, sir!While you've been a-lying a-bubbling here,
your daughter is gone!Rouse yourself from this pastoral torpor.Your daughter is gone!What?Come on, you lazy lot,
and take the London road.Come on, me Slouch.Get up.Follow!Are you wanting anything, madam?We're tired after a long journey
and in need of some refreshment.It'd be an honor to serve such a lady.
Let me help you down.Has, by any chance, a young gentleman,
a Mr. Jones, passed this way lately?Indeed he has, madam,and I'm surprised that a lady like you
inquiring of the likes of him.Brawling, thieving, and bragging about
his mistress, one Miss Sophie Western.Sophie Western?I'm not at all surprised, madam,
after that Molly Seagrim.But I am the same Sophie Western.Well, you can get out of here quick
and take your trollop with you!Go on, get out of here.
Follow your fine friends.Take your fine airs and graces
somewhere else.This is a respectable house,
I'll have you know.We don't want the likes of you here.<i>Our hero's next adventure

so unworthy of my favors.No, indeed, sir.
You've already had trouble enough.My nakedness might well make me ashamed,and I'd go alone if it wasn't

in case the fires consumed him.</i>Sophie! Sophie Western!Sophie! Cousin Sophie!- Look, ma'am, 'tis Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
- My cousin Harriet?- The same.
- Why, so it is.Cousin!Harriet!- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to London.That is my destination.
But why are you both on one horse indeed?Oh, Harriet, I'm running away from home.And I, too, running away from my husband,
Mr. Fitzpatrick,who's hot on my trail, I'm sure.Oh, never marry an Irishman,particularly if he is eaten up with jealousy,
possessed of a quick temper,and a mighty fool into the bargain.But, Cousin,
what will you do alone in London?I have a friend.He has taken lodgings for me
in Curzon Street.Cousin.He's a dear, kind man
and a peer of the realm.You can stay with me.- Oh, may I?
- Come on.- But your friend.
- Oh, he is away for a few days.When he returns,
we will make other arrangements.Now get in, Cousin.
Get in and tell me about yourself.Landlady. Two rooms, please.And perhaps you'd be so good
as to find this lady a gown.She's been involved in an accident
and deprived of her clothes.Take us to our rooms at once.Where's your cat gone to?<i>Heroes,
whatever high ideas we may have of them,</i><i>are mortal, not divine.</i><i>We are all as God made us,
and many of us much worse.</i>Hmm.Oh, all right, all right. I'm coming.I'm coming, I said!- Where's me wife?
- Who?Me wife. Mrs. Fitzpatrick. Where is she?
I've come a distance to catch her.- There's no Mrs. Fitzpatrick here.
- I know she's here.I know it.
Where is that serpent-toothed siren?Ah, then... Look, who's here, girl?Tell me who's here, and I'll make you
the richest poor woman in the nation.Nay, sir, there's only a gentleman,
Mr. Jones.- No lady?
- He has a Mrs. Waters with him.Waters. I'll bet she's using a false name.Aye?That cunning wench.By the waters of the Babylon,
I shall lay me down.I'll bet she's laying down
beside Mr. Jones.Show me her room.- Now, where is she?
- I'll show you in a minute.Where is that place where she lies,
that trough of desire?Down the end there.Mrs. Fitzpatrick!
Come on, Mrs. Fitzpatrick.- My husband.
- Your husband?Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Do you think I don't know his voice?Discovered, you whoreson, all right!Rape! Murder! Rape!- What is it, lassie?
- There's rape going on down there.Huh? Rape?Rape! Murder! Murder!What is all this?Mr. MacLachlan, dear friend,
I am rejoiced to see you here.This villain has debauched me wife.Your wife. What wife?Do I not know Mrs. Fitzpatrick very well?And can I not see that the lady in bed with
this gentleman is not your wife at all, sir?Rape, rape, rape, rape! Rape, rape!Rape, rape, rape!Bless me, girl. What's this hullabaloo?'Tis Tom Jones, madam,
in bed with Mrs. Watersand discovered by her husband,
an Irish gentleman, madam.Forgive me. Did you say Tom Jones?Yes, madam,
in bed with that trull Mrs. Waters.Betrayed.Rape!Ma'am, pray forgive my
dastardly intrusion. I...What in the devil's name
is this disturbance?I thought meself in a respectable inn,
but I see now it's a bawdy house.I have made a mistake.
I was looking for me wife.This set of villains burst into me room.I heartily ask your pardon, ma'am.
I thought you was me wife.Though I see no reason for a Christian
gentleman to be in a lady's bed in his shirt.I heard the lady's screams and ran
to her assistance from the adjoining chamber.Adjoining chamber.It seems, madam, I've had the good fortune
to prevent the lady from being robbed.- Robbed?
- Robbed! I shall have your blood for that, sir.You wild Irish lunatic!Come on, Sophie, dear.
We must fly before Fitzpatrick discovers me.Oh, come. Pull yourself together, Coz.We've got a long ride ahead of us.Help!Sophie.Ah, got you, you fox.
Well, the vixen can't be far away, eh?Cornered you at last, you bastard!Good-bye, madam.
I regret I must take my leave of you.Odsbodikins!After him! Damnation!Oh! There he is!- Miss Western!
- Oh! There's the man!Brother! Brother!Don't be dismayed, sir.She will soon be tired with her journey
and will stop in some inn.She's bound for London, I'm sure.Ah, damn the girl.I'm lamenting the loss
of such a fine morning for hunting.It's confounded hard to lose one
of the finest scenting days of the season.Whoa!Ah!- Ha! Come on, me Slouch!
- What are you doing?Oh!Dobson, drive on.Get on there! Get on!Stand and deliver.Whoa!What did you say, sir?Stand and deliver.Deliver?I am no traveling midwife, sir.
Deliver what?Stand!I will not stand for you, sir,
no nor for any man.- Madam!
- Don't you point that firearm at me, sir.Dobson, drive on.Get up there! Come on! Get up!<i>It is hard when a woman leaves
a man nothing but memories and a muff.</i>Your money or your life!- I only have one guinea, sir.
- Give it here.I'm afraid, as a gentleman of the road,
you cut a very poor figure.Be merciful, sir. I didn't mean any harm.
Truly I didn't.- There's no harm?
- It isn't loaded.- Nor it is.
- I'm not a bandit by profession, sir.Just a poor man down on his luck.Mine, sir, is a sad story.The start of my ruin was 20 years ago.It was all over one Tom Jones.What do you mean?At that time, I was employed
as a barber by a Mr. Allworthy.One day he found a baby
abandoned in his bed.I was accused of being the father.- Then your name?
- Partridge.Father!But I do assure you, sir,
there was no truth in the accusation.- Then who was my father?
- None of us ever discovered.That was the whole beginning
of my downfall.Mr. Partridge, how can I make up
for the suffering you've had on my account?Would you take me on as your servant, sir?My companion in misfortune.Oh, sir.Are lodgings cheap to come by in London?
I have no money.I know an old lady
who runs a lodging house in London.She was Mr. Allworthy's cook
when I was his barber. We will go there.No friend of Mr. Allworthy's
will speak to me now.Mrs. Miller
is one of the kindest ladies I know.Who knows?
She may yet get you back in his favor.Here, you're a lovely boy then.
Have you come to stay?Good day. Oop.No, no, thank you.<i>Desperate to find his Sophie,
Tom called on Mrs. Fitzpatrick,</i><i>who was entertaining
a certain Lady Bellaston.</i><i>The notorious Lady Bellaston.</i>It's the handsome young gentleman again,
madam, inquiring for Miss Western.You see, Bella, how persistent he is?His servant discovered this address,
and ever since he persecutes us.Send him away, Abigail.
Tell him Miss Western is no longer here.Yes'm.Bella, you must let Sophie come
and stay with you.My protector is coming back,and I fear he might take
too much interest in my cousin.Oh, Harriet, you can always rely on me.Your little maid is obviously in the right.He's a very pretty fellow.No wonder so many women are fond of him.Harriet,we must do what we can for Sophie.The girl is obviously intoxicated,and nothing less than ruin
will content her.I'm absolutely certain Sophie was
at Mrs. Fitzpatrick's when I called.Dear Mrs. Miller, what am I to do?I've no friends, no money, no introduction.
I know nothing of London.You're not to worry about the money,
Mr. Jones.You can stay here for the moment.You're very kind, Mrs. Miller.For you, Tom. It's just arrived.I wonder what can it be.What is it?It's an invitation to a masked ball.""The queen of the fairies sends you this.
Treat her favors not amiss.""It's Mrs. Fitzpatrick, perhaps,
with news of my Sophie.Or Miss Sophie herself.<i>Vauxhall Gardens,
where people come to see and to be seen.</i><i>In heaps they run,
some to undo and some to be undone.</i>It's no fun for a man like me
to be dolled up in this damned flummery.All folks of fashion are here.Sophie will be no exception.Well, show her to me,
and I'll have her arrested.Arrested?Do you imagine a woman of stature
can be arrested in a civilized nation?Hmm. A piteous civilized nation, indeed,
where women are above the law.Civilized nation, my trunk.<i>Je vous mÃ©prise de tout mon cÅur.</i>Now, where can my niece be?If you engage any longer with that trollop,
I shall tell Miss Western.- Is Sophie here then, madam?
- Upon my honor, Miss Western is not here.Indeed, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, if you are she,it's a little cruel of you
to divert yourself at my expense.And do you imagine, good sir,I have no better regard for my cousinthan to assist her in carrying on
an affair between you two...which must end in her ruin?Madam, that is the last thing I would wish.If the queen of the fairies
had so little regard for you and Sophie,she would not have appointed
to meet you here.Confess honestly.Are you used, Mr. Jones,
to make these sudden conquests?I am used, madam, to submit.If you take my heart by surprise,
the rest of my body has the right to follow.I hope you won't follow me.I protest I shall not know what to say
if you do.You must be a pauper
if you can't find a chair.Or a miser!I thought you were Mrs. Fitzpatrick.Fitzpatrick.Sir, I am unfamiliar with customs
in the country,but in town it is considered impolite
to keep a lady waiting.<i>With our usualgood breeding,</i><i>we will not follow
this particular conversation further,</i><i>but attend results on the following day.</i><i>Our hero released from Lady Bellaston
a torrent ofaffection,</i><i>as well as a flood ofgifts,</i><i>which he found suitably embarrassing
and quite irresistible.</i>- We must have you looking your best.
- Lady Bellaston, is all this...Isn't that what Miss Western would want?Come back precisely at 4:00.
I shall have news for you then.Send the bill to me, sir.Yes, my lady. Very good, my lady.
Good day, my lady.<i>How could Tom know that Sophie
was now staying here with Lady Bellaston</i><i>and, being besieged
by a certain Lord Fellamar,</i><i>a gentleman with an eye for any beauty,</i><i>especially when a fortune was attached?</i>I do beg you to excuse the play,
but when may I see you again?Forgive me, my lord.I'm afraid my plans for remaining in London
are still a little uncertain.Good day, my lord.Ah... Ah...Oh, madam...- Sophie!
- Tom!I see, Sophie, you're somewhat surprised.- What are you doing here?
- I came to look for you.I found your pocketbook at Upton
and came to ask if I might return it.How dare you mention that place to me.Oh, Sophie, let me ask your pardon.My pardon? After what I heard at the inn?You cannot despise me more
than I do myself.I thought, Miss Western,
you were at the play.The play caused so violent an uproar,
I got frightened and came home,where I found this gentleman.He has apparently found the pocketbook
I told Your Ladyship I had lostand wishes to return it.When I do bring it, all that I ask is that I
might have the honor of presenting it in person.I presume, sir, you are a gentleman,and my doors are never shut
to people of fashion.Thank you, madam.Ladies.Your cane, sir.Oh.A handsome fellow.I don't remember
ever to have seen his face before.Nor I neither, madam.I suspected it was Mr. Jones himself.- Did Your Ladyship, indeed?
- Yes.I can't imagine
what put the idea into my head,for to give this fellow his due,he was very well dressed.I think, dear Sophie, that is not often
the case with your friend.I thought Your Ladyship had said
he was handsome.- Whom, pray?
- Mr. Jones.I meant, of course,
the gentleman that was with us just now.Oh, Sophie. Sophie.This Mr. Jones, I fear,
still runs in your head.I assure you, madam,Mr. Jones means no more to me
than the gentleman who has just left us.Forgive me teasing you.I promise...I'll never mention his name again.Take this to Lord Fellamarand beg him to attend to me tomorrow.She is the only daughter
of a country booby squire.At the playhouse, she blazed like a star.The first moment I saw her,
I loved her to distraction.Her father's estate
is a good Â£3,000 a year.Ooh. Then, madam,
I think it the best match in all England.Then if you like her, my lord,you shall have her.- Honor!
- A letter from my mistress, Mr. Jones.Upstairs?- Honor!
- Oh!- Here.
- What are you doing?- I told my mistress she should...
- Get behind the curtain. Don't speak.- Oh, oh!
- Shh!My dear, charming Lady Bellaston.Dear? Charming?You've been avoiding me.
I should scold you.But... But I don't think I intend to.- Shh! There is a lady...
- A lady?One of your ladies, I suppose?
Where is she?I- I-I...There is a lady in the next room
a- dying, madam.What scheme have you and Sophie
been plotting behind my back?- Madam, I don't understand.
- Answer me one question only.Have you not betrayed my honor to her?Am I neglected,
slighted for a country girl,for an idiot?- Neglected, madam?
- Hmm.Ah.<i>""I charge you not
to think of visiting again,""</i><i>Sophie desperately wrote to Tom.</i><i>""The truth will certainly be discovered.</i><i>Something favorable, perhaps, may happen.</i><i>Until then, we must be patient.""</i><i>Courage, mon vieux.</i>Lord Fellamar is one of the most gallant
young fellows about town.Make love to you, indeed.
I only wish he would.You would be mad to refuse him.Then I shall most certainly be mad.<i>Entrez.</i>Madam, Miss Western is hardly encouraging.My dear lord,
you certainly need a cordial.Fie upon it.Have more resolution.Are you frightened by the word ""rape""?All women love a man of spirit.Remember the story of the Sabine ladies.I believe they made
tolerably good wives afterwards.Come this evening at 9:00.I will see she is alone.Oh, my dear friend,
I'm so entangled with this womanthat I don't know how to extricate myself.I know. Propose marriage to her.To Lady Bellaston?Aye, propose marriage to her,
and she'll call it off in a moment.You haven't a penny,and she'll think you're marrying her
for her wealth.It's very convincing for a man
in your desperate situation.But what if she should take me at my word?
Then I'm caught in my own trap.I promise you she won't.She'll be the one to break it off.Lord Fellamar.Miss Western, it is I.I fear I break in upon you abruptly.Indeed, my lord, I am a little surprised.Love... Love has deprived me of all reason.My lord, I neither understand your words
nor your behavior.You're the most adorable,
most divine creature.I do assure you, my lord,
I shall not wait to hear any more of this.If I were master of the world,
I would lay it at your feet.My lord, I beg you to stop.Let go my hand!
I will never see you again.Then, madam,
we must make the best use of this moment.What do you mean?Oh, rape! Stop!I have no fear but of losing you, madam.Whoa.Where is she?
Damn me if I won't unkennel her now.- Oh, Father!
- Your father?Yes. And who in hell are you?I, sir, am Lord Fellamar,and I am the happy man whom I hope
you will accept as your son-in-law.You're a son of a whore
for all your fancy folderols.I resent your tone, sir.Resent, me arse!
I'll teach you to father-in-law me.Ooh! Ooh.Father, put me down. Put me down.<i>""Dearest madam,"" Tom had carefully written,</i><i>""I am extremely concerned for fear
your reputation should be exposed.</i><i>There is only one way to secure it...</i><i>thatyou bestow on me the legal right
to call you mine forever.</i><i>Thomas Jones.""</i>Understand this.I shall not receive Mr. Jones
if he calls here again.<i>In London, love and scandal
are considered the best sweeteners of tea.</i>I do not doubt that my niece
will welcome the favorsof a gentleman like Lord Fellamar.This Blifil is a hideous kind of fellow.But as you know, Bell,
all country gentlemen are.I don't then wonder at Sophie's infatuation
for this Jones creature.He's an agreeable fellow to look at.Miss Western, will you believe mewhen I tell you that he has had
the audacity to make love to me?Oh, these men.I would have torn the eyes out of a princeif he had attempted such freedoms with me.Indeed, he's even gone so far
as to propose marriage to me.Oh!What is it?With your leave, Bell,
I will show this to my niece.Apply it to what purpose you may please.Uh-huh. Oh.- It's from my Sophie.
- Good.<i>""Sir,"" she wrote,</i><i>""my aunt has just now shown me a letter
from you to Lady Bellaston</i><i>which contains a proposal ofmarriage.</i><i>All I desire is thatyour name
may nevermore be mentioned</i><i>to your obliged humble servant,</i><i>Sophie Western.""</i>You could try Mrs. Fitzpatrick.She might be able to help.<i>'Tis said that hope is a bad supper,</i><i>but makes a good breakfast.</i><i>And in the morning, Tom set off
for Mrs. Fitzpatrick to seek help.</i><i>Not a moment too soon,</i><i>for who should arrive
but his old benefactor, Squire Allworthy.</i>Mr. Allworthy,
what an unexpected pleasure.Good morning, Mrs. Miller.You have come to forgive him.- Forgive who, Mrs. Miller?
- Dear Mr. Jones.Mr. Jones here, madam?No, I've come to bring my nephew,
Mr. Blifil, to London.She must be the most contemptible of women
who can overlook merit such as yours.<i>An old acquaintance arrives.</i>I swear that dirty whore's done it now!
You wait till I get me hands on her.I'll break every bone in her body.Let us meet tomorrow.We will find a way
of easing your predicament.Well... Yes, tomorrow.Thank you.I'm very sorry.My dear sir, I hope there's no ill blood
remaining between us.Upon my soul, sir,
I don't remember your name.Nor I yours, but I remember your face
from the inn at Upton.Upton. Then your name is Tom Jones?Indeed it is, sir.Then you have been with me wife after all.
Well, there's that for you, you rascal.And if you don't give me satisfaction
for that blow, I'll give you another.Fight, damn you!Yaaah!Yaaah!I'm sorry, sir,
but you drew this on yourself.You're a liar.
You set on that gentleman to rob him.I was coming out of the house.Only to defend myself.- He drew his sword on me!
- Step back there.What's this all about?He drew his sword!
What do you expect me to do?Stand there while he cuts me to pieces?Yes, for armed robbery.And you are certain the bastard
will be hanged?No doubt of it.
I hired these two to follow Master Jones,which they did with rare zeal.Good.See that they're properly taken care of,
will you?I will break the news to my uncle.Mr. Jones
has one of the kindest hearts I know.He never mentions your name
but to praise it.Uncle.I- I'm afraid to tell you
what has happened.- It may shock you too much.
- What's the matter, Nephew?Your adopted son, sir, Jones...has proved himself to be one
of the greatest villains on earth.If anyone else had called him a villain,I would have thrown this boiling tea
in his face.Mrs. Miller!I know he's not without faults,but they're those of wildness and youth,and I'm sure many of us have worse.At least we're not in footpads, Mrs. Miller.What do you mean?Mr. Jones has attacked a man.He has been sentenced to be hanged
at Tyburn.Nobody can save him now.<i>And Tom was to swing.</i><i>His enemies had determined on that.</i><i>So lawyer Dowling decided
to pay a call on Mr. Fitzpatrick,</i><i>and who should receive him but Mrs. Waters.</i>Strictly confidential.I come from a most worthy gentleman,whose name at the moment
I am not at liberty to divulge.What does this mysterious gentleman
want of me?He wants you to help him
see that justice is done,to make sure that Jones
gets his just desserts.For any assistance you can give him,
he is prepared to pay handsomely.He is?You interest me, sir.
What is the proposition?<i>Meanwhile,
faithful Partridge searched for anyone</i><i>who could prove Tom's innocence
of the charge against him.</i>Constable.Constable.Have you seen a man
with a big scar on his cheek?No, can't say as I have.But all the rogues in the district
haunt that tavern yonder.Will you accompany me?I don't go searching for trouble, friend.
It's easy enough to come by.Excuse me.Are you the two gentlemen
that saw the fight with Mr. Jones?Tom cannot escape the gallows
unless you retract your evidence.I beg you to do so, and in the meantime
I assure you, you will be rewarded.Harkee, sir, everything we said was true.Now, if I were you, I'd be off,
or you're gonna be the worse for it!<i>Only one hope was left now,
poor Partridge thought.</i><i>Fitzpatrick.</i>- Now, that's better.
- Aye.You'll be all right in a minute.Come in.Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs. Fitzpatrick.Well, if it isn't Mr. Partridge.Jenny Jones.But I'm Mrs. Waters now.Well, whatever are you doing here?Well, I'm a close friend of Mr. Fitzpatrick.
I'm looking after him.Well, indeed, I came to see Mr. Fitzpatrick
to plead for your son.My son?Your son, Tom Jones.He never intended to wound Mr. Fitzpatrick.But I met the man
who wounded Mr. Fitzpatrick at Upton.Then that is the same man,
your son, Tom Jones.With his own mother? With Jenny Jones?How could either of them have known, sir?Good heavens, in what miserable distresses
do vice and imprudence involve men.Ma'am, there's a Mrs. Waters here
to see Mr. Allworthy.What is she doing here?The very woman herself, sir.You probably don't recognize me, sir.Indeed, you are much changed, madam.But what business
can you have with me now?Such business
as I can impart only to you, sir.Pray, leave us.This, sir, is the very man
I was telling you about.- But he is my steward.
- Nevertheless, this is the man.- Do you know this lady?
- That lady, sir?Look you, Mr. Dowling, if you value my favor,
you will not hesitate but answer me truly.Do you know this lady?I have seen her, sir.Before my sister died,
did she give you a letter for me, sir?Come with me, sir.Partridge,
have my coach brought round at once.Yes, sir.- Uncle, I have...
- Harkee, sir.Before I return,
you had better find the letterwhich your mother gave to Dowling here
before she died.Ah, good day, neighbor.Are you going to see your bastard hang?On the contrary, Mr. Western.
We're going to Newgate Jail to save him.Save him? Save him for what?And this is what Mr. Allworthy
is saying to Mr. Western.""My friend, Mr. Fitzpatrick,
has now recoveredand is no longer
charging Tom with robbery.""I couldn't be more pleased
if he were me own son,which it may surprise you to know
he's not.Mr. Allworthy's own sister Bridget,
who was Tom's mother,and I, the one who put the baby
in the squire's bed.And that is what it says in the letter.And so, Tom is now my only heir!Your heir? Did you say your heir?Yes, neighbor.To Newgate, Goody,
and drive for dear life!But I always loved that boy best.He shall have my Sophie by this hand.Tyburn, here I come!Come on, me Slouch! Get on!<i>And another old acquaintance has arrived,</i><i>not only reinstated in the army,</i><i>but now in charge of the condemned.</i>For your life, Goody! Faster!Turnkey!I have come to release a Mr. Tom Jones.We sent him off hours ago.
He'll be strung up by now.But they can't hang him.But I have just procured
this pardon for him.They can't hang an innocent man.They have done often enough before.They won't have reached Tyburn yet.
We must stop them. Come.Faster, faster, faster, Goody!Better luck in the next world, Mr. Jones.<i>To die for a cause is a common evil.</i><i>To die for nonsense is the devil.</i><i>And twould be the devil's own nonsense
to leave Tom Jones without a rescuer.</i>Aaah!Oh, my dear boy. Forgive me.Forgive you?How can I ever make amends for those
unkind, unjust suspicions I have held of you?- You have always used me kindly.
- No, Nephew.- I have used you cruelly.
- Nephew?Yes, you are indeed illegitimate,but your mother was not this lady here,but my sister Bridget.Uncle!- It is true, Tom.
- Ah, this is no time for explanations, neighbor.Tom, thou art as hearty a cock
as any in the kingdom.Go on, after your mistress.Alas, I fear I've sinned against her
for all time.I doubt if she'll speak to me now.No, Tom, don't say you have lost her yet.Go to her now.- Go on, Tom.
- Go to her.Go on, lad.I will!Ah, go to her lad, to her.Harkee, Allworthy.I'll bet thee a thousand pounds to a crown
we'll have a boy tomorrow nine months.<i>Happy the man and happy he alone,</i><i>he who can call today his own.</i><i>He who, secure within, can say,</i><i>""Tomorrow, do thy worst,
for I have lived today.""</i>"
The English Patient|1996|85|Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas|Anthony Minghella|"- How are you?
- Okay.Your leg will be fine.A lot of shrapnel came out.
I saved you the pieces.You are the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.I don't think so.
Here.- Would you kiss me?
- No. I'll get you some tea.- It would mean such a lot to me.
- Would it?Thank you.- Nurse, I can't sleep.
- Would you kiss me?- You're so pretty.
- Will you tuck me in, please?Very funny.
Go to sleep now.- Where's the doctor?
- Don't ask.God, I hate giving blood.
Can't stand needles.Is there anybody from Picton?Picton?
I don't know.I'd like to see somebody
from home before I go.- Do we have anybody from Picton?
- Why Picton?He's from there. Edge of Lake Ontario,
right, soldier?That's where your sweetie's from,
isn't it? Around there?Ask him what company he's with.- Third Canadian Fusiliers.
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.Does he know Captain McGan?He bought it yesterday.
Shot to bits.- What did he say?
- Doesn't know him.Hana, get down!He's dead. He's dead.He's dead.He's dead. God!<i>Name, rank, serial number?</i><i>No, sorry.</i>I think I was a pilot.I was found in the wreckage of a plane
at the beginning of the war.Can you remember
where you were born?Am I being interrogated?You should be trying to
trick me, make me speak German.- Which I can, by the way.
- Why?- Are you German?
- No.How do you know you're not German
if you don't remember anything?Might... Might I have
a sip of water?- Thank you.
- It's okay.I remember lots of things.I remember her garden,
plunging down to the sea.- Nothing between you and France.
- This was your garden?- Or my wife's.
- You were married then?I think so. Although I believe that
to be true of a number of Germans.Look.I have this much lung.The rest of my organs
are packing up.What could it possibly matter
if I'm a Tutankhamen?I'm a bit of...
toast, my friend.Sorry I can't help you.Are you all right?I know you hate to be moved.
I'm sorry.Hana!- Jan?
- Hana! Hana!There's meant to be lace in the next
village. The boys are gonna take me.- You don't have any money, do ya?
- No.- Just in case there's a sale.
- No.Hana, I know you do.
Come on.- No!
- Oh, come on.I swear to God,
this'll be the last time. I swear.She's a softie.
She loves me.I'll pay you back! I promise!I'm not sewing
anything else for you.I love you!Whoa!
Pienza, boys!Get some water over here!Jan! Oh, no!Hana, where're you going?- Stay back!
- Stop, Hana!Stay...No!No!- Hey! Hey!
- Don't move!- Don't move!
- Don't move!Stand absolutely still!You're walking in a mine field!Good.That's good.Just stay still for me...and we'll be fine.What are you doing?What the bloody hell do
you think you're doing?It's Jan's.Are you in pain?
Do you need something?- Yes.
- Okay.Are you okay?- You and Jan were...
- We keep moving him in and out of the truck.Why? He's dying.
What's the point?We can hardly leave him.
Do you mean leave him?No, no, I don't mean leave him.This will help you.I must be a curse.Anybody who loves me...anybody who gets close to me...Oh, I must be cursed.Which is it?- When he dies, I'll catch up.
- It's not safe here.The whole country's crawling with
bandits and Germans and God knows what.- It's madness! I can't allow it.
- The war is over.How can it be desertion?It's not over everywhere.
I didn't mean literally.This is normal, a shock,
for all of us, Hana.I need morphine, a lot.
And a pistol.If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.We're heading for Leghorn.""Livorno"", the Italians call it.We'll expect you.Fine.- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.- Oh, Hana.
- I'll be okay.I'll catch up.
Good.What... What was
all that banging?Are you... Are you fighting rats
or the entire German army?No. I was repairing
the stairs.I found a library,
and the books were very useful.Before you find too many
uses for those books,you might read some to me.I think they're all in Italian,
but I'll look, yes.- What about your own book?
- My book?Oh, yes, the Herodotus.Yes, you can read him.Oh. I found plums.We have plums
in the orchard. There.We have an orchard.Herodotus is
the father of history.- Do you know that?
- I don't know anything.Hmm.It's a...It's a very plum...plum.A mountain the shape
of a woman's back. Good, good.- Hello, Geoffrey!
- Madox, hello!- Welcome to the expedition.
- How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton.Splendid to finally
meet you all.This is Dante D'Agostino
and Diggy Bermann, our archaeologists.- Beautiful plane.
- And this is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist.- And this is my wife, Katharine.
- Hello.We're your new apprentices.Welcome to the International Sand Club.- To the International Sand Club.
- I'll get cups.- Marvellous plane. Did you look?
- Yes.Isn't it? A wedding present
from Katharine's parents.We're calling it Rupert Bear.- Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
- AlmÃ¡sy.We can finally consign my old bird
to the scrap heap.Mrs. Clifton,
I'd like to present...- Count AlmÃ¡sy.
- Hello.Geoffrey gave me your monograph
and I was reading up in the desert.- Very impressive.
- Thank you.I wanted to meet the man who could write
a long paper with so few adjectives.Well, a thing is still a thing,
no matter what you place in front of it.Big car, slow car,
chauffeur-driven car.Broken car. It's still a car.- Not much use, though.
- Love?Romantic love,
platonic love, filial love.- Quite different things, surely.
- Uxoriousness.That's my favourite kind of love.
Excessive love of one's wife.Now there you have me.- They're tourists.
- Absolute rot.They're highly recommended
by the Royal Geographic Society.She's charming and
has read everything.- He's meant to be a ruddy good flier.
- We don't need another pilot.He can make aerial maps
of the whole route.You can't explore
from the air, Madox.If you could explore from the air,
life would be very simple.Contact.Contact.I should try and move the bed.I want you to be able
to see the view.It's good. It's a view
from a monastery.- I can already see.
- How?- How can you see anything?
- No, no, not the window.I can't bear the light anyway.I can see all the way
to the desert.I'm turning you.Exploring before the war,
making maps.Is there sand in my eyes?
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?No sand.
That's your morphine speaking.I can see my wife in that view.Are you remembering more?- Could I have a cigarette?
- Are you crazy?Why... Why are you so determined
to keep me alive?Because I'm a nurse.Bravo.âª We have an old-fashioned tomato âªâª A Long Island potato âªâª But yes
We have no bananas âªâª We have no bananas today âª- Next!
- Katharine!""The King insisted that
he would find some way...""to prove beyond dispute...""that his wife
was fairest of all women.""'I will hide you in your room
where we sleep,' said Candaules...- ""said Candaules.""
- Candaules.""Candaules"".Candaules.Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen has
the same practice every night.She takes off her clothes...and puts them on the chair
by the door to her room.""'And from where you stand,""'you will be able to gaze
on her at your leisure.""'And that evening, it's exactly as
the King has told him.She goes to the chair,removes her clothes one by one,until she's standing naked
in full view of Gyges.And indeed, she was more lovely
than he could have imagined.But then, the Queen looked up...and saw Gyges concealed
in the shadows.And although she said
nothing, she shuddered.And the next day,she sends for... for Gyges
and challenged him.- And hearing his story, this is what she said.
- Off with his head!She said, ""Either you
must submit to death...""for gazing on that
which you should not,""or else kill my husband
who has shamed me...""and become King in his place.""So Gyges kills the King,marries the Queen and becomes ruler
of Lydia for 28 years.The end.Shall I spin the bottle?So, Geoffrey,
let that be a lesson to you.- D'Agostino!
- D'Agostino!<i>Are you asleep?</i>Yes.No. I'm dropping off.Go away!Go! Go!Buon giorno.- Hana?
- What do you want?I met your friend Mary.She said I should stop and see
if you were all right.Apparently we're neighbours. My house
is two blocks from yours in Montreal.Cabot, north of Laurier.- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.For you.I'd like to take credit for it,
but it's from Mary.My name is David Caravaggio,
but nobody ever called me David.Caravaggio they find
too absurd to miss out on.Oh!Oh!Oh, shit.
Stupid hands.Let me do that.They're fresh.I haven't had an egg in...Have you noticed
there are chickens?In Italy, you get chickens
but no eggs.In Africa, they're always eggs
but never chickens.- Who's separating them?
- You were in Africa?Yes, I was.So was my patient.Look, I'd like to
stay for a while.I have to do some work here.I speak the language.
There are partisans to be disarmed.We embrace them and see
if we can relieve them of their weapons,you know, while we hide.I was a thief, so the army
thought I'd be good at it.- So you can shoot a pistol?
- No.Do you have a problem
with those?No.- Well, I should look at them before you go.
- Look.It's a big place.
We needn't disturb each other.I'll sleep in the stable.It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don't sleep.I don't know what Mary told you
about me, but I don't need company.I don't need to be looked after.There is a man downstairs.He brought us eggs.
He might stay.Why? Can he lay eggs?He's Canadian.Why are people always so happy when they
collide with one from the same place?What happened in Montreal
when you passed a man in the street?Did you invite him
to live with you?He needn't disturb you.He can't. I'm already disturbed.There's a war. Where you come from
becomes important.Why? I hate that idea.Ah! It's gonna work.Gently.Can I help?It's finished.So, you're our
Canadian pickpocket?""Thief"" I think is more accurate.I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?Oh, all over.All over?I kept trying to cover
a very modest portion and still failed.- Are you leaving us?
- Yes.Now's our opportunity
to swap war wounds.Then I'm definitely going.Does she have war wounds?I think anybody
she ever loves...tends to die on her.- Are you planning to be the exception?
- Me?I think you've got...the wrong end
of the stick, old boy.So...Caravaggio.Hana thinks
you invented your name.And you've forgotten yours.I said that no one would ever invent
such a preposterous name.And I said you can
forget everything,but you never forget your name.Count AlmÃ¡sy.That name mean anything to you?<i>Or Katharine Clifton?</i>Oh, I'm sorry.- How much did you pay?
- Oh, hello.They don't see foreign women
in this market. How much did you pay?Um, Â£7 or Â£8, I suppose.- Which store?
- Why?You've been cheated.
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.I don't want to take it back.- This is not worth Â£8.
- It is to me.- Did you bargain?
- I don't care to bargain.That insults them.I don't believe that. I think
that you're insulted by me somehow.I'd be very happy to obtain
the correct price for this.I apologize if I appear abrupt.I'm rusty at social graces.How do you find Cairo?- Did you visit the pyramids?
- Excuse me.Or the Sphinx?Latitude, 25, 33.
Longitude, 25, 16.We attempt to drive north-east of Kofer,
we'll leave our bones in the desert.- I disagree.
- You're Hungarian. You always disagree.- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.- How is your charming wife?
- Marvellous. She...She's in love
with the hotel plumbing.She's either in the swimming pool.
She swims for hours.She's a fish. It's quite incredible.
Or she's in the bath.Actually, she's just outside.Chaps only in the Long Bar.Mrs. Clifton.You'll have to forgive us. We're not
accustomed to the company of women.Not at all. I was thoroughly
enjoying my book.- The team is in mourning, darling.
- Oh, really?I'm afraid we're not having much luck
obtaining funds for the expedition.Oh. Well, what'll you do?More modest expedition,
or even wait a year.- It's a disaster.
- Remind our families we still exist.Good heavens,
are you married, Madox?Very much so.
We all are.- Save my friend AlmÃ¡sy here.
- I feel much better.Don't you, darling?
We were feeling rather self-conscious.Well let's toast, then.
Absent wives.- Absent wives.
- And present ones.And future ones.Thank you.Excuse me.
May I?- Why did you follow me yesterday?
- I'm sorry. What?After the market,
you followed me to the hotel.I was concerned. A woman
in that part of Cairo, a European woman.- I felt obliged to.
- You felt obliged to?As the wife of one of our party.So why follow me?
Escort me, by all means.But following me
is predatory, isn't it?Could I ask you to move?I'm sorry, but I...I'm sorry. Of course.- It's just when you move.
- How stupid of me.- I can't really bear the pressure. I'm...
- Are you all right?I was dreaming. Awful.Hana.Hana, are you all right?Leave me alone.You're in love with him,
aren't you?Your poor patient.You think he's a saint
because of the way he looks.I don't think he is.I'm not so in love with him.I'm in love with ghosts.So is he.
He's in love with ghosts.What if I told you
he did this to me?How could he have? When?I'm one of his ghosts,
and he wouldn't even know it.- I don't know what that means.
- Ask your saint who he is.Ask him who he's killed.Please, don't creep
around this house.See, I don't think
he's forgotten anything!I think he wants to forget!<i>Gentlemen, to mapmaking.</i>To mapmaking!And a special thank you
to Geoffrey and Katharine,without whose fund-raising heroics,
we'd still be kicking our heels.- To arm-twisting.
- Arm-twisting.Did Katharine say Geoffrey
has to fly back to Cairo?Return the favour.
Take a few photographs for the army.Oh, um, what kind
of photographs?Portraits.The brigadier,
the brigadier's wife,the brigadier's dog, brigadier
by the pyramids, brigadier breathing.And I shall,
of course, be bereft.I'll finally be able to
explore the Cairo nightlife.I shall produce an authoritative guide
to the zinc bars and...I want to say hareems. Are we
in the right country for hareems?Harems.- Bye, my love.
- Travel safe.Catch up in a week.Clifton, safe journey.You too. Good luck.
Glad the funds have turned up.Clifton.This is probably
none of my business.Your wife.- Do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
- Appropriate?Well, the desert is, it's, uh...
for a woman, it's very tough.I wonder if it's
not too much for her.Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.
She told me yesterday.- All the same, were I you...
- I've known Katharine since she was three.We were practically brother and sister
before we were man and wife.I think I'd know what is and what isn't
too much for her.I think she'd know herself.Very well.Why are you people
so threatened by a woman?I have come to love...that little tap of the
fingernail against the syringe.Tap.Tap.Tap.Stop playing! Please, stop playing.I don't have the key
to that door. You...The Germans were here.
The Germans were all over this area.They left mines everywhere.And pianos were their
favourite hiding places.I see. Sorry.Then maybe you're safe
as long as you only play Bach.He's German.Is something funny?No. I'm sorry.I've met you before.I don't think so.Look. See?Move that, and no more Bach.Lieutenant!
Are you all right, sir?Fine, Sergeant.So you're working
with the Italians.Yeah, trying to get them
to give up their weapons.I was a thief, so the army
thought I'd be good at it.- I like the Italians.
- Really?He wants us to move out.He says there could be
50 more mines in the building.He thinks I'm mad
because I laugh at him.He's Indian.- He wears a turban.
- No, he's Sikh.If he wears a turban, he's Sikh.I'll probably marry him.Really? That's sudden.My mother always told me...I would summon my husband
by playing the piano.- I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
- Why? Is he staying?With his sergeant,
a Mr. Hardy.We should charge.
Doesn't anyone have a job to do?They have to clear all the roads
of mines. That's a big job.In that case, I...
I suppose we can't charge.No, we can't.Thank you.âª Flat foot floogee with the floy floy âªâª Flat foot floogee with the floy floy âªâª Flat foot floogee with the floy floy âªI've been thinking. How does someone
like you decide to come to the desert?What is it? You...You're doing whatever you're doing in
your castle, or wherever it is you live,and one day you say,
""I have to get to the desert"", or what?I once travelled with a guide
who was taking me to Faya.He didn't speak for nine hours.At the end of it, he pointed
at the horizon and said, ""Faya.""That was a good day.Actually, you sing.- What?
- You sing.All the time.- I do not.
- Ask Al Auf.Al Auf!âª You'd better be ready about half past 8 âªâª Remember, honey
Don't be late âªâª 'Cause I'll be there
When the band starts playing âªâª Gonna dance off both my shoes âªâª When they play the Jelly Roll blues âªâª Tomorrow night at the dark-town strutter's ball âªGive me your hand.Thanks.Madox!Madox!Madox!- Come quickly! I've found something!
- What is it?D'Ag! Bermann! Quick!My God.They're swimming.They're swimming.Ow!- You okay?
- Yeah.How do you explain...to someone who has never been here,feelings which seem quite normal?I don't know, my friend.I don't know.- Aaah!
- Kamal!Bermann, what are you doing?Bermann!- Watch out!
- Watch out!- Get them out of the car!
- Let me help!AlmÃ¡sy, are you all right?Yes, yes, I'm fine.My wrist! Ah!I'll be back as quick as I can,
36 hours at the outside.Try to get
an additional radiator.We can store it between here
and Pottery Hill. And a better jack.- We planned badly.
- Bermann?Safe journey.Now what?Let's get all this stuff off.- I'll stay behind, of course.
- Certainly not.- I caused the problem. I shall stay.
- You can't. None of you can.No, I insist. There clearly
isn't room for all of us.I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not
one of the walking wounded.It's only one night.If I remain, it's the most effective
method of persuading my husband...to abandon whatever he's doing
and come and rescue us.- All right.
- Come on, let's get going.I thought you might like to
paste them into your book.Well, we...We took photographs.There's no need.No, really.
I'd like you to have them.Well, there's really no need.
This is, um...This is just a scrapbook.
They are too good.I should feel obliged.
Thank you.And that would be unconscionable,
I suppose, wouldn't it?To feel any obligation.Yes, of course it would.You should come into the shelter.I'm quite all right, thank you.- Look over there.
- What am I looking at?Do you see what's happening
to them, the stars?- They're so untidy. I was trying to rearrange them.
- No, no.Over there.In a few minutes,
there'll be no stars.The air is filling with sand.- This is not very good, is it?
- No.- Will we be all right?
- Yes.Yes.Absolutely.""Yes"" is a comfort.
""Absolutely"" is not.Let me tell you about winds.There is a, a whirlwind
from southern Morocco,the Aajej,against which the Fellahin
defend themselves with knives.And there is a,
a Ghibli from Tunis.- A Ghibli?
- A Ghibli.Which rolls and rolls
and rolls and produces a...a rather strange nervous condition.And then there is the,
the Harmatten,a red wind, which mariners call
""the sea of darkness"".And red sand from this wind...has flown as far as
the south coast of England,apparently producing...showers so dense that they were
mistaken for blood.Fiction!We have a house on that coast
and it has never, never rained blood.No, it's all true.
Herodotus, your friend.- My friend.
- Your fri...He writes about it...and he writes about...a... a wind, the Simoon,which a nation thought was so evil,they declared war on it
and marched out against it.In full battle dress.Their swords raised.Katharine, Katharine, I need
to get out your side, quickly.A car! Let me out!Of course. I'm sorry.Ridiculous to fall asleep!Unforgivable!Damn! The flare!Stop! Over here!Here!Stop!Madox!Madox! Madox!Our tracks have disappeared.Madox will calculate how many miles.
He'll soon turn around.Could I ask you, please, to...paste your paintings
into my book.I-I should like to have them.
I should be honoured.The others!- Oh, God.
- Quick!Oh, how awful!
We've got to get them out.Quick! Get the other shovel!Am I a terrible coward
to ask how much water we have left?A little in our can. We have, uh, water
in the radiator, which can be drunk.And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.
It's extremely practical.We, uh... Oh, come on!
Come on!There's also a plant.I've never seen it, but I believe you can cut
a piece the size of a heart from this plant,and the next morning it'll be filled
with a delicious liquid.Find that plant,
cut out its heart.Here.Here's the window.Clear the glass. I'll clear the door.
Mind your hands.It's okay. We're here.Come on, clear it quickly.Hang on. Coming.- I've got it. I've got it. Help them out.
- Here.Katharine.Water.Geoffrey's not in Cairo.He's not actually a buffoon.The plane wasn't
a wedding present.It belongs
to the British government.They want aerial maps
of the whole of North Africa.So I think he's in Ethiopia.In case you're counting
on his sudden appearance.And the marriage.Is that a fiction?No, the marriage
isn't a fiction.Oh, thank God.Thank God.Madox. It's Madox.Am I K. in your book?I think I must be.Chapter one.""He sat in defiance of municipal orders
astride the gun Zamzammah...""I can't read these words. I can't
read them. They stick in my throat.Because you're
reading it too fast.- Not at all.
- You have to read Kipling slowly.Your eye is too impatient.
Think about the speed of his pen.What is it?
""He sat, comma,""in defiance of
municipal orders, comma,""astride the gun Zamzammah...""on her brick...""
What is it?""Brick platform, opposite the old

is it you object to?The writer,
or what he's writing about?What I really object to, Uncle,is your finishing
all my condensed milk.And the message everywhere in your book,
however slowly I read it,that the best thing for India
is to be ruled by the British.Hana, we have discovered
a shared pleasure, the boy and I.- Arguing about books?
- Condensed milk.One of the truly
great inventions.I'll get another tin.I didn't like that book either.
It's all about men.Too many men.
Just like this house.You like him, don't you?
Your voice changes.No, I don't think it does.Anyway, he's indifferent to me.I don't think it's indifference.- Hana was just telling me, you're indifferent...
- Hey!...to her cooking.Well, I'm indifferent
to cooking.Not Hana's cooking
in particular.Have either of you tried
condensed milk sandwiches?They're very good with salt.Welcome back, Madam.Will you not come in?No.- I should go home.

I love hedgehogs.And what else?Marmite. I'm addicted.And baths. But not with other people.Islands.And your handwriting.- Mmm.

Paper?Is it? I don't know.Paper.Paper?Darling, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry, something's come up.<i>Oh, no.</i>Now don't sulk. I'll be

- I'm not.I'm going to surprise her. It's our
anniversary. She's forgotten, of course.What's the symbol of your first
anniversary? I should get something.Is it cotton or paper?Your first anniversary? I thought you
two'd been married for donkey's years.We've been friends for donkey's years.
Best friends.She was always crying on
my shoulder about somebody.I finally persuaded her to settle
for my shoulder. A stroke of genius.- Moose, are you there?
- Yes.- First anniversary. Is that cotton?
- Uh, is what cotton?First wedding anniversary.Your first anniversary is... paper.- Stop.
- Please?S... Stop here.- Here?
- Just stop right here.Yes, sir.This...

Well, there's, um,this Hungarian count.He's a wanderer.
He's a fool.And for years he's on
some kind of a quest for...who knows what.And then one day, he falls under
the spell of a mysterious English woman,a harpy, who beats him
and hits him.And he becomes her slave
and he sews her clothes and worships...Stop!
Stop it!Stop! You're always
beating me.Bastard.You bastard!
I believed you!You should be my slave.I claim this shoulder blade...No, wait. No, I want...
Turn over.I want this, this...

a nuisance it is to wash.Try this. I found
a great jar of it.Olive oil.Thank you.Is this for my hair?Yes, for your hair.There was a general
who wore a patch...over a perfectly good eye.The men fought harder for him.Sometimes I think
I could get up and dance.What's under your mittens?What's under your mittens?He's waiting for you.I'll see you tonight?Look, Moose, we need you
to stay in Tobruk.I know it's a bit of a short straw,
but Jerry's got our maps, you know.And now they're getting
their spies into Cairo using our maps.They'll get Rommel into Cairo
using our maps.The whole of the desert's like a bloody
bus route, and we gave it to 'em!Any foreigner who turned up:""Welcome to the Royal Geographic.
Take our maps.""Old Madox went mad, you know.- Did you know Peter Madox?
- Yeah.Magnificent explorer.
Thanks, Aicha.And after he found out
he'd been betrayed by AlmÃ¡sy.His best friend.Absolutely destroyed
the poor sot.Hey, Commandant, stay in line!Hello, little Tommy.
Little baby, hello.- Recognize him? British friend?
- No.- Get up!
- No!Get up at once!I don't have a boyfriend.I don't know anybody!Halt!No! No!David Caravaggio.No.This was taken in Cairo
at British headquarters.July '41.And so was this.August '41.
And this.February '42.It's possible.I was buying or selling something.
I've been to Cairo many times.You are a Canadian spy
working for the Allies.Code name: Moose.Can you get me a doctor?
I'm sick.I'm leaking blood!You want a doctor?I've been askin' for weeks,
months, I don't know...We don't have a doctor.But we do have a nurse.Sure, great.
A nurse would be great.Look, give me something.
A name, a code.So we can all
get out of this room.I can't think in this heat.- It's too hot.
- I slept with a girl.I've got a wife in Tripoli.A girl comes up and points
at you, you only see trouble.Fire!I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.This is your nurse, by the way.She's Muslim, so she'll understand
all of this.What's the punishment for adultery?
Let's leave it at that.You're married and you were
fucking another woman, so that's, uh...Is it the hands that are cut off?Or is that for stealing?
Does anyone know?Well, you must know.
You were brought up in Libya, yes?- Don't cut me.
- Or was it Toronto?Ten fingers.How about this?You give me a name for every finger.
It doesn't matter who.I get something,
you keep something.- I'm trying to be reasonable.
- Don't cut me. Come on!Are thumbs fingers?- I get no help from these people.
- Telephone.I'm sick of this room, I'm sick of
this heat and I'm sick of this phone!Ah! The Geneva Convention!Hey, come on!
You can't do that!- Come over here.
- I'll give you names.- You!
- I'll give you names!- Come on!
- What names did you say?Aaah! Aaah! Let me think!
Just let me think!I can't think! I know them!
Please, let me think!I promise!
Oh, please, please, no!- What name did you say? I knew them!
- Come on!- I can't think of any names! Not my hands! Oh, dear God!
- What are you waiting for?Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, no!I promise!
Oh, please, not my hands!No! Jesus!
Jesus! Oh, dear God!- Please don't cut me!
- Come on!Aaah! No!Please don't cut!Don't!<i>The man who took my thumbs?</i><i>I found him eventually.
I killed him.</i>The man who took my photograph?
I found him too.That took me a year.
He's dead.Another man
showed the Germans...a way to get
their spies into Cairo.I've been looking for him.You can't get through there.
It's impossible.I was looking again
at Bell's old maps.If we can find a way
through the Wadi,we can drive
straight into Cairo.- This whole spur is a real possibility.
- So on Thursday,you don't trust Bell's map, Bell was
a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map.But on Friday,
he's suddenly infallible.- And where are the expedition maps?
- In my room.Those maps belong to
His Majesty's Government.They shouldn't be left lying around for
any Tom, Dick or Harry to have sight of.What on earth's
the matter with you?Don't be so bloody naive!
You know there's a war breaking out!This arrived this morning.""By order of
the British Government,""all international expeditions
to be aborted by May, 1939.""What do they care
about our maps?What do we find in the desert?Arrowheads, spears.In a war, if you own the desert,
you own North Africa.Own the desert? Ha!Um, Madox?

I can't do this anymore.I'd better go now.Say goodbye here.I'm not agreeing. Don't think
I'm agreeing, because I'm not.Any minute now, he'll find out.We'll barge into someone.
It'll kill him.Don't go over it again, please.Katharine?I...I just want you to know I'm...I'm not missing you yet.You will.You will.I believe I'm rather late.Good.

Oops!Mustn't say ""International"".
Dirty word, filthy word.His Majesty, die Fuhrer,

What's your point?And the people here don't want us.
You must be joking.The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of

Isn't that right, Sir Ronnie?What's my point?

You're completely blasted!- Sit down!
- Absolutely right! Shut up! Shut up!Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.I can't think what came over me.Lashings of apologies...all around.Thank you.- Why were you holding his collar?
- What?""What""? That boy.
That little boy.You were holding his collar.
You were gripping his collar. What for?Hmm? Is he next?Are you going to drag him
into your little room? Where is it?Is this it?- Don't do this.
- I've watched you.I've watched you
at garden parties,on verandas, at the races.- How can you... stand there?
- Please.How can you ever smile,as if your life hadn't capsized?You know why?Dance with me.No.Dance with me.I want to touch you.I want the things which are mine,
which belong to me.Do you think you're the
only one who feels anything?Is that what you think?Why don't you go?- Get some sleep.
- Would you like me to?Good night.Hana.Kip.Just wait.
Don't look at anything yet.Wait.Kip!Oh, thank you!Mmm!If one night I didn't come
to see you,what would you do?I try not to expect you.Yes, but if it got late and...I hadn't shown up?Then I'd think
there must be a reason.You wouldn't come to find me?Hmm. That makes me

he wants to be found.I do. I do want you
to find me.I do want to be found.I was looking for
Lieutenant Singh.- He's sleeping.
- Only we've got to go to work.I'll tell him.What is it?
Is it a mine?It's a bomb by a viaduct.- Does he have to go?
- Beg pardon?What if you couldn't find him?
Sergeant, not today. Not this morning.- What's happening? Am I needed?
- Afraid so, sir.Don't go.
I'm frightened.This is what I do.I do this every day.Hardy!Serial number K-K-I-P...2-6-0-0.K-K-I-P 2600, sir!I'll get the oxygen.Hardy, what's happening?Can't see, sir!
It's from the road!Corporal?Tanks, sir!
I don't know what it's about!- Stop 'em!
- Stop!Stop!- Hardy!
- Stop! Stop!What is this, a bloody carnival?The fuse has snapped!What's happened? Is it armed?Hang on a second.I'll be right with you.Can you see the detonator, sir?You've got to cut it, sir.
That frost won't last.Stop! Stop!
Slow down!Stop! Stop!
Slow down!- Go away!
- Yes, sir.- This is making me incredibly angry.

to forgive myself.I'm never going
to bloody forgive myself.Sergeant Hardy, sir.
It was booby-trapped.They was runnin' up the Union Jack, sir,
up on that statue.It just went off, sir.Sergeant Hardy climbed up,
Sir, just for a lark, sir.It should've been me.
It was my idea.- Sir, you don't wanna look.
- Ooh.Who's that girl?His fiancÃ©e, sir.- Hardy's?
- He kept it a bit dark.Kip?Kip, it's me.I'm so sorry about
what happened.Can I talk to you?
Kip?Kip, why won't you talk to me?Oh, Kip.Oh, let me come in!Hana tells me you're leaving.There's going to be trials.They want me to interpret.Don't they know
I'm allergic to courtrooms?So...I come across
the hospital convoy.They're looking for this stuff.This nurse, Mary,tells me about you and Hana...hiding in some monastery in...What do you call it?
Retreat?How you came
out of the desert...and you were burned
and you didn't remember your name,but you knew the words
to every song that ever was...and you had one possession:
a copy of Herodotus.And it was filled...with letters and cuttings.Then I knew it was you.Me?I saw you...writing in that book
at the embassy in Cairo...when I had thumbs
and you had a face...and a name.I see.Before you went
over to the Germans,before you found a way to get Rommel's spy across
the desert and inside British headquarters.He took some
pretty good photographs.I saw mine in that
torture room in Tobruk.So, it made an impression.I had to get back to the desert.
I'd made a promise.The rest meant nothing to me.What did you say?That the rest...
meant nothing to me.There was a result
to what you did.It wasn't just another expedition.
It did this.If the British hadn't
unearthed that photographer,thousands of people
could have died.Thousands of people did die.
Just different people.- Yes, like Madox.
- What?You know he shot himself,
your partner,- when he found out you were a spy.
- What?Hold...Madox thought
I was a spy? No.<i>No, I was never a spy.</i>It's ghastly.
It's like a witch hunt.Anybody remotely foreign
is suddenly a spy.- So watch out.
- Right.We didn't care about
countries, did we?Brits, Arabs,
Hungarians, Germans...None of that mattered, did it?
It was something finer than that.Yes, it was.I'll leave the plane
in Kufra oasis.- So, if you need it...
- Right.Hard to know
how long one's talking about.We might all be back
in a month or two.Hmm.I have to teach myself not to
read too much into everything.It comes of too long having to read
so much into hardly anything at all.Good-bye, my friend.There is no God.But I hope someone
looks after you.In case you're still wondering,this is called
a suprasternal notch.Come and visit us in Dorset
when all this nonsense is over.You'll never come to Dorset.<i>So, you didn't know
Madox shot himself.</i>No.And you didn't kill
the Cliftons?She...She...She die...She...
I can't.Well,maybe I did.Maybe I did.<i>I was packing up
our base camp...</i><i>at the Cave of Swimmers.</i><i>Clifton had offered to fly down
from Cairo to collect me.</i><i>He flew like a madman always,</i><i>so I...
I took no notice.</i>Katharine?Dear God, Katharine,
what are you doing here?I can't get out.
I can't move.""Surprise"", he said.Poor Geoffrey.He knew. He must've
known all the time.He was shouting, ""I love you, Katharine.
I love you so much.""Is he badly hurt?I have to get you out.- Please don't move me.
- I have to get you out.- It hurts too much.
- I know, darling, I know. I'm sorry.Come on.Now!Why did you hate me?What?Don't you know
you drove everybody mad?Shh. Don't talk.You speak so many
bloody languages...and you never want to talk.- You're wearing the thimble.
- Of course.You idiot.I always wear it.
I've always worn it.I've always loved you.It's so cold.I know. I'm sorry.I'll make a fire.Did you get Geoffrey
out of the plane?- Yes, I did.
- Good. That's good. Thank you.Listen to me, Katharine.You've broken your ankle...and I'm going to have
to try and bind it.I think you've also
broken your wrist...and maybe some ribs, which is why
it's hurting you to breathe.I'm going to have to
walk to El Taj.Although, given all the traffic
in the desert these days,I'm bound to bump into
one army or another.And then I'll come back
and you'll be fine.You promise?I wouldn't want to die here.I don't want to die
in the desert.I've always had a rather
elaborate funeral in mind.Particular hymns.And I know exactly
where I want to be buried.In our garden,
where I grew up...with a view of the sea.So promise me
you'll come back for me.I promise...I'll come back for you.I promise...I'll never leave you.You have plenty of water...and, um, food.I'll open them for you.A good read.Don't waste this.Will you bury Geoffrey?I know he's dead.I'm sorry, Katharine.I know.Every night...I cut out my heart.But in the morning
it was full again.Darling.My darling.âª You'd better be ready
about half past 8 âªâª Now, honey
Don't you be late âªâª I'm going to be there

and at twilight.</i><i>Three days there on foot,
I told her,</i><i>and three hours back by car.</i><i>Don't go anywhere.</i><i>I'll be back.</i><i>I'll be back.</i>Just walked in
from the desert, sir.Morning.Dear golly, where have
you come from then?There's been an accident.I need a doctor...to come with me,
and I need to borrow this car.I'll pay, of course.- And I need... I need morphine.
- May I see your papers, sir?What?If I could just see
some form of identification.I'm sorry, I'm not making sense.
Forgive me, I... I'm not...I've been walking and...A woman is badly injured
at the Gilf Kabir, the Cave of Swimmers.I'm a member of the
Royal Geographical Society.Right.Now, if I could...
just take your name.Count LÃ¡szlÃ³ de AlmÃ¡sy.""AlmÃ¡sy"". Would you mind
spelling that for me?- Look, listen to me, will you?
- What nationality would that be?A woman is dying.
My wife is dying.I have been... walking...I have been walking
for three days.I do not want to spell my name.- I want you to give me this car.
- I understand you're agitated.Perhaps if you'd like to sit down,
I can radio back to H.Q.No. No, don't...
Don't radio anybody!Just give me the fucking car!Stop the car, please.
A woman is dying!Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen
to another word from you,I'm going to give you
a fucking good hiding!Fritz? What are you
talking about, Fritz?Well, that's your name,
isn't it?Count Fuckin' Asshole
Von Bismarck!- What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
- Please!You have to listen!
Katharine!<i>Katharine!</i>Excuse me.- I also need to use the lavatory.
- You'll have to wait.- It's urgent.
- Sarge!Sarge, Jerry wants
to use the lav.Says it's urgent.- Where are we going, please?
- Oh, up north to the coast.Benghazi.
Soon be there.You can get your boat
back home then.All right, go on then.
Here, you take him.I've been up and down
this bloody train all day.It doesn't open.<i>So yes,</i>she died because of me.Because I loved her.Because I...Because I had the wrong name.- And you never got back to the cave?
- I did get back.I kept my promise.<i>I was assisted by the Germans.</i><i>There was a... a trade.</i><i>I had our expedition maps.</i><i>And after the British
made me their enemy,</i><i>I gave their enemy our maps.</i><i>So I got back to the desert...</i><i>and to Katharine...</i><i>in Madox's English plane...</i><i>with German gasoline.</i>When I arrived in Italy,on my medical chart they wrote,""English Patient"".Isn't that funny?After all that,
I became English.You get to the morning and the
poison leaks away, doesn't it?Black nights.- I thought I would kill you.
- You can't kill me.I died years ago.No, I can't kill you now.We've been posted.
North of Florence.I was thinking yesterday...yesterday...The patient and Hardy.They're everything
that's good about England.I couldn't even say
what that was.We didn't exchange
two personal words,and we've been together
through some terrible things.Some terrible things.He was engaged
to a girl in the village.I mean...And us, he never once...He didn't ask me if I could spin
the ball at cricket or Kamasutra or...I don't even know
what I'm talking about.You loved him.Katharine.I'm still here.You'd better be.Don't depend on it, will you?That little bit of air
in my lungs,each day it gets less and less.Which is all right.It's quite all right.I've been speaking
to Caravaggio,my research assistant.He tells me there's a ghost
in the cloisters.I can join him.- Hana!
- It's the boy.I'll always
go back to that church.Look at my paintings.I'll always
go back to that church.So one day we'll meet.Thank you.Read to me, will you?Read me to sleep.<i>""My darling,</i><i>""I'm waiting for you.</i><i>""How long is a day in the dark?</i>""Or a week?""The fire is gone now...""and I'm horr...""

the tablecloth Rosie gave me?It's beautiful. It's got red flowers on it.Yeah. I think she made it.
No. No, not yet.No, I made omelettes.
I started 'em. Kind of Tex-Mex.No. That was the worst thing you've
ever done to me in my life, Mother!Well, I think you owe my husband
an apology.Until you apologise to my husband,
I'm not listening to any of your gossip.No. Well, he's right here.(FLAP MOUTHING)Hold on.- Yes.
- No.- Yes.
- No. No.Yes.Hello, Mrs Greenway.No, ma'am,
I am not enjoying your predicament.Momma, you be nice. I swear.As a matter of fact,
I don't need or desire an apology.All I want is for you to understand
and appreciate my position,to respect our marriage,and to maybe wait another 15 minutes
before you call in the morning.Yes, I guess I've said my piece.Okay, I'll put her on.He's so great! I told you.
I'll talk to you later. All right?(I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE
PLAYING OUTSIDE)GARRETT: I don't care about
the neighbourhood.Can't you stay a little while longer?I thought we were having
a real good time, didn't you?Listen, don't go yet.One more minute. No, I've got
something I want to show you.No, really.(CAR ENGINES STARTING)- Thanks.
- Good night.Oops!(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)- I bought you something.
- What?A tie.Emma.You didn't buy this tie for me.You were worried about
how I was gonna look to your mother.Now I wish you would stop being
such a quisling where she is concerned.Why is it every time I get happy,
you turn perverse?- Buying this tie made you happy?
- Yes! Yes!I wish you could understand this,
'cause you really don't.I mean, it made me very happy,
buying this tie.I went to two or three places
before I finally found the right place.And then describing your jacket
to the salesmanand knowing how perfect it would match
with what you were wearing,which, by the way, it certainly does.I mean, it was fun!It was a goddamn Mardi Gras,and you're just too dumb
to understand that kind of happiness!I'm sorry. I'm being terrible.Going to your mother's,
it makes me a little irrational.- Can I help?
- Yes. Thank you, Flap.Would you take this candle to Emma?
I need another one.- In the kitchen?
- Yes.That looks great.Who's that short gentleman?Not that it's any of your business, but...
Just leave it at that.What are you looking at?
She isn't there any more.She'll be back.I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend.Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart.God, isn't she something?Here she comes.I met her two weeks ago at church.I guess you might say
she's God's gift to Vernon Dahlart.- Then you like her?
- Oh, no. Does it show?(VERNON CHUCKLES)Good food.Well, this is what I used to serve
when I lived in Boston.Vernon, you haven't said a word.Is that right? I feel like I haven't
stopped talking since I came in.I guess because
I've been thinking about you so much.Can I give you a suggestion
on how to handle me, Vernon?Yes, ma'am.Don't worship me until I've earned it.Thank you, ma'am.
I appreciate any advice you can give me.- Don't talk with your mouth full, Vernon.
- Oh!(CHUCKLES)VERNON: I wouldn't do that, really.
I just did it to make you laugh.What's wrong with you?- I got some good news.
- What's that?I'm unofficially pregnant.We haven't gotten the tests back yet,
but you know me. I'm never late.Well...I don't understand.Um...If you're not happy for me...I'm gonna get so mad
if you're not happy.(SCOFFS)Why should I?(SHOUTING) Why should I be happy
about being a grandmother?Does this mean you won't be
knitting the baby any booties?(GUESTS LAUGH)Flap.Every time you get more
than two drinks in you, you confront me.And I won't have it. I won't have it,
not in this house. Excuse me.(GARRETT MUMBLES)Do you need some help?No. I'll be fine
just as soon as I stretch my legs.AURORA: Oh, God.
DORIS: Mr Breedlove.You're bleeding.Yeah.It's okay.- Come on in.
- No, thank you.- What are you afraid of, Doris?
- Afraid?Well, why not...Why not come on in then?Because you're much older
than the boys I date,'cause you're drunk,and because when I went there tonightto see a United States astronaut
give a lecture,I didn't expect him
to prowl after us all night long.I didn't expect some silly flirt
who had to keep his jacket openbecause his belly's getting too big.(GRUMBLES)I expected a hero.(MUMBLES)Well, okay, Doris, don't come in.I don't want you in my house.Lee Anne, would you like to come in?You better tend to that cut.Tommy, show me your belly.
Come on. Come on!How can you let him run around
dressed like that?He's adorable. Look at him.EMMA: (PLAYFULLY) Uh-oh!(CHUCKLES)Uh-oh!
Great, Tommy.Uh-oh!(TELEPHONE RINGING)That's Vernon, I'm sure.
So tell him that I'm...Out?No. Tell him I'm resting.Hello? Hi, Flap.Where? No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.Oh, Flap, you did not
expect I'd be happy.Let's be honest with each other
before we start pretending.Um...Look, Mom's staring at me right now,so can I talk about it later to you?Yeah. All right. Bye.(CHUCKLES)How long you going to
keep this a secret?The only school that would accept Flap
for his associate professorshipis in Des Moines.He can't even do the simple things,
like fail locally.It's gonna be fine, Momma.
It's Des Moines.FLAP: Say, ""Bye bye, house.""
TOMMY: Bye bye, house.FLAP: All right.(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)Be careful going down these steps.
I don't want you to break your leg.Come here.Come here. Come here.Oh!ROSIE: Stay sweet, honey.Rosie.That's enough, Rosie.
They have to get started.You tell Momma to drive you home
when you work late.Have some fun, Rosie.Don't act so brave. I know you're gonna
go crazy without me to nag.You be good to her,
or else we're gonna get you.- I mean it.
- (CHUCKLES)Bye, Flap. Have a good drive.Okay, fingers and toes in.
Take Momma's purse.(CHUCKLES)(LAUGHS)Momma, that's the first time
I stopped hugging first.I like that.Get yourself a decent maternity dress.You had to get one in, didn't you?Will you tell her, Patsy?She keeps thinking it's me
when I say those things.Tom.Are you gonna be good to your mother
and take care of her?- Bye, Mrs Greenway.
- Goodbye.Listen, you write
as soon as you get there,so I'll have your address and all, okay?You shape up, Patsy.Dropped my gum.We'll get you another piece, sweetheart.The phone bill is gonna be enormous,
you know that?I'll miss you, Momma.(SOBS)- FLAP: Can we go now?
- Yeah. Pull away slow.(TYRES SQUEAL)FLAP: Honey, I think it's gonna be
so good for us to be away from your...- Our families.
- I miss Houston.You don't know how lucky you are.
Everybody wants to go to Des Moines.People come from all over the worldjust to get one look at Des Moines
before they die.Some people say
it's the best city in lowa.I know you're teasing me.
Texas is the best!Well, I think you should stop worrying.We're going to see some
terrific new things. We are.(GARRETT YELLING INDISTINCTLY)Would you please, if you will,
hold it down over there?GARRETT: Sorry, I can't hear you.Hold it down! Have some respect
for other people's feelings!GARRETT: Come over a little closer.Hey, you in the bush, I can't hear you!I'm sorry, but I just took a sauna,and it's real hard not to yell
when you hit that cold water.You're not gonna ignore me
when I speak directly to you?I'm not ignoring you.
What am I supposed to say?Okay, it's kind of hard not to yell
when you hit that cold water.Hey, come here.Come here?- What is your name? Aurora?
- Yes.You want a shock?No, not especially. What?Well, we're going to have
this dinner at...A NASA dinner at the White House.You know, some cosmonauts
and all of us, and...I didn't know who I could take.'Cause all the people that I flew with,well, their wives would give me
bitch bites all up and down my backif I showed up
with one of my regular girls.I didn't know anybody old enough,
so I thought,""Well, I'll ask my next-door neighbour.""Well, anyway, they cancelled the dinner,but I was really thinking
about asking you out.Seriously, ain't that a shocker?Yes.Imagine you having a date
with someonewhere it wasn't necessarily a felony.(CHUCKLES)Yeah, well...What would you have said
if I asked you? Seriously.I would have said
I'd like to see the White House.So you would have come?What the hell? You want to have
dinner out some time?- No, thank you.
- What about lunch?You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot, don't you?You know, there's something
about your manner.It's like you're trying to toy with me.That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.No, this is the element.- This is exactly...
- Do you want to play, Aurora?You wanna go to lunch?We'll have lunch.Well, if you want to have lunch with me
in some restaurantso we could improve the atmosphere
in this neighbourhood,I wouldn't exactly say no.Come here. We're too far apart to talk.Now, Aurora.Since you've agreed,why don't we just forget
about the rest of it?I mean, I know how you feel.There were countdowns
when I had my doubts.But I said to myself,
""You agreed to do it.""You're strapped in,
and you're in the hands""of something bigger
and more powerful than yourself.""So why not just lay back
and enjoy the ride?""I'm not going.
There is something wrong with you.God, I'm such a shit.FLAP: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That must be it right over there.EMMA: Right there? Oh, God.
Flap, it's great. Is that it, really?FLAP: I think that's it.
EMMA: It's great. Isn't that sweet?- That was a bump.
- Yeah.- What is that?
- Shall we go see the house?You stay here.
I'll come around and get you.Stay right there.Come on. Let's get this off.Come on.Come on!Oh! Come on, sweetheart.
Did you hurt yourself?Nope, not yet.Do you like it? Do you like it?Oh, it's great. Flap, it's great!Oh, my God.(FLAP GROANING)(ROCK-A-BYE YOUR BABY
WITH A DIXIE MELODY PLAYING)We'll leave the mattress down here.
We can sleep here.EMMA: I'm really tired.(EMMA GRUNTING)Oh!- Ow. Ow.
- Oh.(SIGHS)You ever made love in lowa?Oh, you know what's great?Tommy's room is clear on
the other side of the hall,so we can get as noisy as we want.Good. You get to make your little
high-pitched squeak. (CHUCKLES)(MIMICS SQUEAKING)Stop it! What about you?
What about you?""Here I come. Here I come again!
Yes! Yes! Yes!""Here I come again. Yes.Yes.Oh, God. You just made me wet.How can you do that with your voice,
just like that?You just make your voice like that.God, if Tommy can't hear us,
we can't hear Tommy!- He's fine, mother!
- Don't get pissy. I'll be right back!(FOR ME AND MY GAL PLAYING)(EMMA SINGING ALONG)I have eight or nine papers left to grade.
This isn't love. It's selfishness.Well, it's been almost a whole week
since we've been together.I don't think we've gone
a whole week, Flap.- Sure, we've gone a week.
- No, only in the real pregnant months.And you're always getting home so late,
Flap. Forget it. Forget it!Just do me a favour, Flap.Don't make me feel silly,
I won't make you feel guilty, all right?Fair enough. I have to hurry.Be a good boy.Emma?Oh! I absolutely love that you came back.
You're saving our lives.You know you're saving
our lives by doing this.I love that you came back, Flap. I love it!Tommy, breakfast will be ready
in a minute. You just wait right there.Let's hurry.
I've got to grade those papers.God, I just can't believe it.- I'll give everybody a B!
- Come on. Wait! Wait!Emma, come on!(EMMA SQUEAKING)(SNIFFLES)(TELEPHONE RINGS)Hello? Hi, Mother.Look, could we talk later?
'Cause I've got to get the boys off,and it's not a good time
for me to be on the phone.Don't be so inconsiderate.I'm all set to have
a nice, good talk with you.Besides, you've got almost an hour
to get the boys off. What's wrong?- Nothing.
- Stop right here. Tell me what it is.Okay, Mother. I need some money.
I need you to loan me some money.I really and truly need it, so will you?Mother, please don't be quiet. You know
how hard that was for me to ask you.You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was just thinking.Thinking what?How much I hate to part with money.(CHUCKLES)Well, I wouldn't have asked if...Don't yell, but I really think
that I may be pregnant again.Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!And you're going to have it, I suppose?Yes, of course.
What's happening to you, anyway?Don't act like that's so terrible, Emma.I keep hearing about
lots of bright, young womenwho are having simple abortions.Simple?And then they get wonderful jobs.You can go right across the state
to Colorado and have it.I don't know why I tell you anything.I mean, I seem to like you
less and less, Mom.You know why, Emma?It is because I am the only person
who tells you the truth.Go get dressed, okay?How is your life gonna get better if you
keep having children with that man?What miracle is going to come along
to rescue you?Leave me alone. I need the money.Why don't you give me
the painting to sell?No! I won't do that. That's your security.
I will not have you using that for rent!Let's not do this. All right? All right?I'll talk to you later. All right?- All right. If the money would mean...
- No, no, don't give me the money.- It would make you crazy.
- Yes, it would.We'll talk later. You call me tonight
if you want, all right? Goodbye.Daddy just got home.Hey, no kidding?
Is it tough being a genius?Boy!Great news. I know what my topic is.
I have it all figured out.What's wrong?Where have you been all night, Flap?I'm sorry, Ems. I fell asleep
on that big sofa at the library again.I don't know what's wrong with me.I'm on to you.- I'm not doing anything.
- Yes, you are.I hate it when you
get this unhappy, okay?We go through this stage every time.No, no. Don't change the subject.What's the subject?That I'm on to you.You wouldn't try to look so innocent
unless you were guilty.You're gonna have
to take my word for it.You have no other choice.No, no, no, no, no.Oh! Whoa! (CHUCKLES)(CLEARS THROAT)Excuse me.Emma, you always get a little paranoid
in your first few months, okay?Just...If you are doing something,and you're trying to make me feel
crazy because I'm bearing our child,then you may have just sunk to a point
so low that you will never recover.You may have just panicked, Flap,
and trying to save yourself,you've thrown out your character
and your principles.Now the only way
you could possibly redeem yourselfand be the man
that God intended you to beis to admit to me anything that
you might have been doing last night.'Cause if you don't do that,
if you don't do that right now,you are a lost man.A shell, a bag of shit dust.You've got to tell me.
For us, honey. Come on.(TELEPHONE RINGS)Hello?Hello, Aurora.How are you?
Yes, she is. She's right here.Nice to hear your voice again.FLAP: (SHOUTING)
I don't know why you don't get a jobif you're worried about money.EMMA: What am I going
to do with the baby?FLAP: It's supposed to be a great day
when you get tenure!EMMA: Oh, Flap, we don't have
enough money to pay the bills now,all tenure means is,
we won't have enough money forever!FLAP: I don't see why
you don't ask your mother!EMMA: That's convenient for you!
I should ask my mother!- (BABY CRYING)
- FLAP: Go ahead! Call her!Why should today be any different?Get on the phone, Emma!
Get on the phone!EMMA: Why don't you call?FLAP: Yeah, right.
I'm gonna call Aurora, right!Get on the phone! Get on the phone!
Get on the phone, Emma!Get on the phone!
Get on the damn phone!- Mommy said to wait right here.
- Stay if you want.What are you guys doing here?I told you to wait out
in front of the house.Answer me, Tommy.I didn't want people
to think we live there.What?I said I didn't want people
to think we live there.(WHISPERING)
Cut it out.Okay. You're allowed to say
one mean thing to me a year.- That'll do till you're 10.
- You're driving Daddy away.Okay, Tommy. Stand up and follow me.
Don't make me hit you on the street.Hurry up.I said hurry. Come on!$44.Twenty, 30...Let's see. That's $38.40.You don't have enough money?I don't have any cheques. I guess
I'll have to put some things back.Can I have the register key?
She doesn't have enough money!It's not such a big thing.
I brought the wrong purse.Here, take this.$43.75.$41.35.Mom, you promised
I could have something!I'm not gonna give her
real food, all right?- Can't you give her this?
- No way!- $40.35.
- Mom!All right. Here.$40.55.$40.75. Hey, we're going
in the wrong direction.Why do you have to be
so goddamn nasty?I mean, it's not going to help anything.We're both people, you know?$40.75.I don't need it.Mrs Horton,
I'm Sam Burns from the bank.I turned you down on the second
on your house.Of course. I remember who you are.Look, can I help you make up
the difference here?Thanks. I'd appreciate it.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.Oh, no.You're a very rude young woman.I know Douglas from the Rotary,and I can't believe he'd want
you treating customers so badly.I don't think I was treating her badly.Then you must be from New York.- Be careful, Teddy!
- What?Be careful!- Where's your car?
- Right here.It was looking like
the worst time I've ever had.I didn't know I could get
cheered up so fast. I'm grateful.- No problem.
- Come on, Mom.- Wait over by the car a second, honey.
- Come on!- Wait over by the car, honey.
- No! Come on!- (STERNLY) Wait over by the car, honey.
- But...(SHOUTING) Wait over by the car,
honey! Over by the car!Now! Now! Now!Nice boys.You're great with them, too. Really.I think all three of us
are going through a stage.- Hey, thanks again.
- Oh, no thanks required.- I've had a lovely time.
- Me, too.- I'll get the money back to you.
- Oh, don't bother yourself.You could just drop it
in the mail if you like.- To the bank?
- Sure.You could even use
a cheque-by-mail envelope.Or you could come in. Whichever.Maybe I'll come in some time.Well, that'd be fine.- Hey, can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I'm used to this.And so, another birthday
for a gal named Aurora Greenway.Even though 50,
she still takes my breath away.Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky.A heavenly object, a siren's cry.You're the best. Happy birthday.- Thank you, Edward.
- Excuse me, Aurora.Thank you. Do you want one, Vernon?Would you like a kiss?You're not lying about your age,
are you?Of course not.I thought you were 52. She's really 52.Come on, Aurora, how do you expect
to fool a family doctor?- It seems to me she said her age.
- Thank you, Vernon. Thank you.My point is, the number doesn't matter,
but the effort to conceal it does.- Rosie, why does he keep talking?
- Dr Ratcher...Damn it,
I'm trying to do some good here!- Now, the way to adjust to old age...
- ROSIE: Doctor.Doctor, I think you're a mite confused,because of being
recently widowed and all.(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)You okay?Hmm?VERNON: Aurora?Aurora?Let's give her some privacy.(DOORBELL BUZZES)GARRETT: Yeah?
The door's open. Just a minute.Well, hello.Hi.I was curious if you still wanted
to take me to lunch.I wasn't aware that we...
I don't know what you...A few years back,
you invited me to lunch.- A few years back?
- That's right.I wondered if the invitation still exists.
Would you like to?Do lunch.- Not dinner, remember? It was lunch.
- Why not? No.Good.(SIGHS) When?Uh...- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?All right. All right.Good.- 12:30?
- 12:00.Good.Thank you.If you mind the open air,
I could get the top.Oh, no. Don't worry.Grown women are prepared
for life's little emergencies.Us going out together. Not bad, huh?Do you think... Do you think
you could possibly put the top up?The top's at home in the garage.Hello, there. How are you?- How are you, Ali?
- Hello. How are you?It's nice to see you.WOMAN 1: Fred, that we met at that bar.
He asked me out.WOMAN 2: Oh, God.
WOMAN 1: We went to the Cadillac Bar.Have you ever been there?It's a fun place if you're with
the right people, it really is, but I wasn't.(WOMEN CONTINUE
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)(SIGHS)
Well, I'm starving!No hidden meaning in that remark.Well. Would you like an oyster?No.- Thank you.
- It's good.I think that is extremely rude,noticing other women
when you're with me.I think we're going to have to get drunk.I don't get drunk,
and I don't care for escorts who do.You got me into this.You're just gonna have to trust me
about this one thing.You need a lot of drinks.To break the ice?To kill the bug that you have
up your ass.WAITER: May I get you something?Yes, I think I will have some bourbon,
preferably Wild Turkey.- Aurora?
- Yes?You're not fun, by any chance, are you?I don't really think we should think
about that right now.Impatient boys sometimes miss dessert.(CHUCKLING)(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC
PLAYING ON STEREO)(TURNS OFF MUSIC)(HONKS HORN)We both got here at the same time!Hi, Sam. How are you?
It's nice to see you.Oh...It's always so nice to see you.
I can hardly believe it.You, too.What I didn't expect
was that there would be momentswhere I'd forget to be scared that
someone would see us together.Sam, you don't have to be scared.I mean, contemplating sin
is all we've done.It doesn't mean anything.Oh.I'm glad that you've been
contemplating it, too.I didn't know that.Well, all these lunches,
all this hand holding?Emma.I'm not going
back to the bank this afternoon.I have to go out
and inspect a new house.It's pretty far out, and well, it's empty.- I gotta pick up my kids at 5:00.
- Oh, okay.Well, I understand.
Look, don't give it a thought.Emma.I haven't made love to a woman- in almost three years.
- How come?My wife has a disc problem.And she can't take havingany weight on her.Sam, I hope you don't mind me
asking you this,but have you ever thought
of your wife getting on top?(SCOFFS)She wouldn't do that.She may surprise you.No, I don't think so.
It would be so unlike her.Did you ask?About 600 times.(LAUGHS)EMMA: What are you thinking?SAM: Tell me,
do you prefer Texas to lowa?Oh, come on, Sam.
What were you really thinking?SAM: Really, that's exactly what I was
thinking when you just asked me that.I don't know. There seems to be
an absence of wildness, you know?Even in the people!Well, we're farmers, and we talk poor,because the farmer aspect of things is,""don't let anybody know
you have anything"",and, ""don't call attention to yourself"".My wife says...Well, I guess
we shouldn't talk about Dottie.Wind in the hair! Lead in the pencil!(LAUGHS)Feet controlling the universe!Breedlove at the helm!Just keep pumping that throttle!Keep giving it that gas!I see the Gulf of Mexico below me!- I'm not enjoying this!
- (LAUGHS) Give it a chance.- I am going to stop!
- Fly me to the moon!How are you?
It's not my fault, but I'm sorry.If you wanted to get me on my back,
you just had to ask me.AURORA: Mmm!- (GRUNTS)
- Ow!- Ow! My hand!
- Get it out of there!- I can't! I swear!
- Get it out!- I swear I can't get it loose.
- Out!I swear to God!We were having such a good time,
and you had to go do this!Please...Please, anything!
Bend down! Bend down!- Why did you have to get drunk?
- I'm not drunk any more!The pain sobered me up.Oh, no.Emma, this might be
a terrible thing to ask,but are you thinking
about your husband at all?- Oh, I was a little.
- We can go back right now.No, Sam. Stop it.Look, I want to do this.I'm glad that I don't know whether
or not Flap's been with someone else.I'd hate to think that I was doing this
just to get even.(BRAKES SCREECH)- Just... Look... Great! Fine!
- (WHIMPERS)Great!You're parked in my driveway!
You're breaking the law!Thank you!Would you like to come in?I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.Everything would have been just fine
if you hadn't gotten drunk.I was... I just didn't want you to think
I was like one of your other girls.Not much danger in that unless
you curtsy on my face real soon.Garrett!What is it that makes you so insistent
on shocking and insulting me?I mean, I really hate that way of talking.
You must know that.Why do you do it?I'll tell you, Aurora.I don't know what it is about you,but you do bring out the devil in me.- Where are you?
- (MACHINE WHIRRING ON PHONE)SAM: I'm in the laundry room
so nobody could hear me.Yes. But, Sam, I can't hear you either.(WHIRRING GROWS QUIETER)Wait a minute.

for a little sweet talk.(KNOCKING AT DOOR)- TEDDY: Mom, I have to go!
- Just a minute.- What?
- Really!Hurry up.- EMMA: What is it?
- Just how absolutely good I feel.And even though I'm scared,
and we've committed adultery,no matter what happens,
I'm just so grateful to God or the devilfor letting me feel this way again.Oh, I'm so glad you told me that.- (WHISPERING) Don't flush!
- (WHISPERING) You told me always to!EMMA: No, not this time.Emma, is everything okay?- Can you talk?
- No, it's all right.- Can I hold Melanie?
- Yes.- Honey, is everything okay?
- What?- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.- Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.
- Emma...OPERATOR: I have

anything more to do with me.Why?I don't wanna go into it.Was it because
you wouldn't go to bed with him?On a first date, Emma?(SCOFFS)
It's hardly a first date, Mother.You've been living
10 feet away from him for 15 years.Why don't you talk
about the real reason?I don't know what you mean.Because it's been about that long
since you've done it.Shut up! I mean it! Shut up!Come on, it's just me.- No.
- Call him!- No, no, no! I'm hanging up.
- No, no. Okay, I'm sorry.- I'm hanging up.
- Call him now! So long.Oh!(TELEPHONE RINGING)- Hello?
- Hello, Garrett.Yes?Well, I was just sitting here realising...Realising that I had
never shown you my Renoir.What are you talking about?I'm inviting you to come over
and look at my Renoir.You're inviting me to bed.Yes, it happens to be in my bedroom.Is the Renoir under the covers?
(LAUGHS)Don't cackle, Garrett.- Do you want to see it?
- Do I want to come to your bedroom?- Let me think.
- Do you?Just give me a minute.It's a tough one.Um...(GARRETT MUTTERS)Yeah, okay. I guess so. Sure, why not?(SIGHS)I'll see you in a bit.If I don't answer the bell,
that means that the back door's open.The back door's open.(DOORBELL RINGS)My God. He ran it.(PANTING LIGHTLY)Hi.I was doing laps when you called.Lucky for us, I only did eight.This is it. This is the Renoir.I like it.I like the painting.I like everything in here.Relax, baby...Now, just who do you think
you're talking to like this?Don't you realise I'm a grandmother?It's not flattering to look too surprised.I'll just be a minute.- I like the lights on.
- Then go home and turn them on.I'm sorry.(BOTH CHUCKLE)Come on.Dad. Come on. Wake up, Dad.- What? What?
- Melanie's sick.- What?
- Melanie's sick.- The baby's sick.
- The baby's sick?Are you coming, Flap?TEDDY: See, Mom, see?
See. What do you think is wrong?EMMA: I have to look first.(MELANIE CRYING)Come on, Dad.(CRYING LOUDLY)Thank you.You can go to bed.
She's gonna be all right. She is. Go on.- I couldn't sleep. So why can't I stay up?
- Go to bed. I'll be there soon.It's bad enough
we're making this a drama.It's not going to qualify as high drama.It's okay. It's okay.Thanks.I'm sure it's the croup.Remember? Tommy had it twice.(MELANIE COUGHING)- Guess you were in the library.
- (CRYING RESUMES)Oh.(MELANIE COUGHING)That's the worst sound in the world.FLAP: How long do you
keep her in here?Why? Are you going back to bed?I just asked how long.I don't know.Until her throat clears, or I lose
20 pounds, whichever comes first.I don't know. About 20 minutes, I guess.I've been offered a job.What? Why didn't you say something?I just wanted to think about it.It's head of the English Department
at Kearney State College.It's for about the same money.Oh.- Where is it?
- Nebraska.Ooh.(CHUCKLES)
I really don't want to move from here.I love the school, the paediatricians...It's the head of the department.(FUSSING)We'll talk about it, all right?
I like it here, Flap.Head of the department, that's...
That's great.(SIGHS)- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye.Come on, Teddy.Don't kiss the baby.
She may still be sick.Have a good day at school.Oh! You don't know the night I had!Melanie decided to get the croup,
and of course, it happened at 3:00 a.m.,so I don't think
I've even gotten any sleep yet.Anyway, I don't know if he's kidding.Flap told me that he's taking us
to some college in Nebraska.And I'm not sure,but I think Sam is becoming
someone that I need in a strange way.(WHISPERING) I'm lying here
next to the astronaut.Are you really?(LAUGHS)
How was it?I'll speak to you later.I'll let you go. Oh, I feel so good for you.I do. You call me
as soon as you can. Okay?- Bye.
- Bye.(LAUGHS)
Mel.Okay, Mel!GARRETT: I just want to
make this clear, you know.I see other women.I didn't exactly think we were engaged.- Okay, okay.
- Your ego, really!Okay. Let's stay in tonight.- Boy, you're saving a fortune on me.
- I'll cook.It's been three weeks,
and you haven't even seen my house.My best instincts had me avoiding it.What are you thinking?Oh...I'll tell you what.I think this is really sad,that you feel that you need
all this stuff to impress girls with.Need it?Sometimes it isn't enough.I don't think there's anything wrong
with using all your assets.Except, you see, I think that
it turns your profession into a sex trap.Come on. Everybody uses
whatever they have. I earned it!There's 106 astronauts in the whole
fucking world, and I'm one of them!It's as much a part of me
as anything else.I'm sorry. I didn't...I didn't mean to trip
on such a deeply felt principle.GARRETT: Do you want to
know what bothers me?None of us ever got together
in one room, locked all the doors,and compared notes on the experience.I think there was a rule we had to
pretend that it wasn't the fun that it was.You do sense the speed.I remember looking out
the window of the spacecraft.(CHUCKLES)God, I sound like somebody with
a big belly telling stories about Korea.Anyway, this one time,
I'm looking out the window.I see a piece of the spacecraft,
and it's whistling along the ground.It doesn't make a sound.The only sound you hear,
the only noise in the entire worldis your heart beating.Ah.(CHUCKLES)(SIGHS) It's indescribable.Anyway, I can't think of a better way
of saying it, but that was it.That was my moment,
the one that doesn't go away.You know what I mean?Yes.Mmm.Hey.This is my moment.(CHUCKLES)(LAUGHING)
No, don't get nervous, Garrett.(BOTH LAUGHING)(COUGHING)Flap?Anybody?(STUDENTS CHATTERING)(WHISTLING)WOMAN: You don't think it's love
because we're having fun.Love can be fun.
Would you stop making faces?(FLAP LAUGHS)(WOMAN LAUGHS)That's wonderful.FLAP: I think what we have here
is a typical grad school girl crush.Would you please, please, please
stop telling me that this is just a crush?Janice, the whole fun
with getting involvedwith someone who is unavailable
and a little bit older is thatsometimes you get to
hear what's really going on.- Flap, you are such a...
- Incredible asshole!(COOS)(STAMMERS)Excuse me.- Excuse me.
- MAN: Watch it, buddy!Emma.God damn it, Emma.
You're gonna ruin us!- 'Cause you're a spectacle!
- I am not!Stop jiggling her like that.
She's gonna throw up.Your timing was perfect.
You caught us before we did anything.I'm taking the car,
and I'm gonna take the kids.I'm gonna go to Houston.Give me the baby.You don't know what I did.
You don't know.Just like I don't know what you do
on your little afternoon drives.Take the...STUDENT: Professor Horton,
can I speak to you about my grade?You ought to be happy that I'm going off.If I stayed here, I'd make life hell for you.Don't follow me.Excuse me. Excuse me.(HONKING HORN)It's them. It's them!(WOMEN LAUGHING)- Garrett, you're gonna meet Emma.
- No, you don't need outsiders.- You're no outsider!
- I'll see them later.Please, come with me.Em, Em, this is Garrett.Oh!- The one...
- Pleasure to meet you.I've heard so much about you.Your mother's really been
looking forward to this, too.So, go ahead.- Anything wrong, Garrett?
- No.It was very nice to have met you.Must be nice to be home, huh?Oh, it's great. It's great.I'll be over later.They're probably tired anyway
and will get to sleep early,and I'd like to get to bed early.
(CHUCKLES)TEDDY: Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!Come on. Bye-bye.ROSIE: Come on out. All right.Whoa! This one likes to squeeze.Teddy likes to squeeze.
Tommy likes a squeeze.You both get a squeeze. And...The baby. Where's the baby?Oh!There is my baby.Look at the baby!Oh!EMMA: I keep thinking
she looks a little like you.A little? It's like looking in the mirror.EMMA: She loved the ride.
She hardly cried at all.- Mmm!
- (BABBLING)- Bring in the suitcases.
- Okay.- Mom.
- Well, I talk to you every day.(MELANIE BABBLING)- Mother, you look great.
- And you look terrible.Nobody wants a girl who's washed-out
and tired-looking all the time.I just drove about 1,000 miles.Besides, all the men
love me the way I am, Mother.It's just like you that when you finally
take one small step away from Flap,it's with a married,
unavailable, older lowan.- Tell me about the astronaut.
- We have to talk about it.Are you going to sleep now,
or are we gonna talk?How's the astronaut, Mother?- Really?
- (LAUGHING)- Oh, really?
- Yes!- He has a name, though.
- You really like him.Yeah.(LAUGHING)
Well, it's just so...It's so strange that relatively...Relatively late in life,
I've found that sex is so...So... So...So...So fan-fucking-tastic!Anyway, that's what he calls it.(BOTH LAUGHING)(EMMA SIGHS)A moth to flame.This affair is going to kill me.No. Maybe not. Why do you say that?Come on, Mom.(VOICE BREAKING) I never thought
I'd start to need him.Oh.You're so lucky you have a pool.Come on. Stand there. Just stand there!- Okay.
- Okay.Let's talk about Los Angeles.
Do you miss it?(CHUCKLES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)It was so interesting
dating Jews after the divorce.- They are so lively.
- Really?Yeah.In Los Angeles, they were so anxious
to make you feelas if they understood your secret
thoughts better than anybody.WOMAN: Patsy!And I was just glad I had some.Honey, there's a telephone call for you.Hello.Oh, hi, Flap. How are you?I'm fine.- I guess I look older, like everyone else.
- She does not.Flap, you sound the same, and I'm not
sure that's such a good thing.(LAUGHS)Yeah, she's right here.No, we have not. We have other things
to talk about besides you.(LAUGHS)Hello.I'm fine.What's up? Feeling contrite?You don't seem to understand, Flap.
I saw you together.What?You know, Flap, I can't believe
you're doing this to us.(VOICE BREAKING)
Well, I think you're spiteful,and I don't know
when the hell that happened.No! Goodbye. I'll... Goodbye.(SOBBING)Flap accepted the job
at Kearney, Nebraska.I gotta go back.
We're gonna move in a week.Emma, I don't know why
you don't leave him.Honestly, I don't know, either. He's cute.I've been packing for us all week.- Sure remembers her daddy.
- Yeah.So, are you gonna stay mad?I think being uprooted with my kids
without my consentis at least worth a pout, don't you?Come on.- Head of the department.
- I know. I know.Here.- Aurora?
- Garrett! I'm back here.Well, hello, stranger.
What's it been, about two days?GARRETT: Your family still around?No, they left.What?You probably know
what I'm going to say.Maybe not. I hope not.Well...You're some kind of woman,
but I'm the wrong kind of man,and it doesn't look like my shot
at being the right kind isas good as I was hoping for.You don't even know
how much you're gonna miss me.I don't want to blow smoke up your ass.Oh.(CHUCKLES)
What a relief.It's just that I'm starting
to feel an obligation here.And it makes it rough,
especially living next door.I'm starting to think
I gotta watch what I'm doing...Blah, blah, blah, blah...(MOUTHING)I am gonna miss you.And I do feel bad.You're lucky.I feel humiliated.Can I have a picture of you?Well, yeah, but the only one I have
has Flap in it.I don't mind.(CHUCKLES)Come here. Give me a kiss.When you finish this, I need this
kind of type or something close.- Hello, Emma. Hi, baby.
- Hi.She wanted her daddy
to see her dressed upbefore she went to the doctor.He'll be here any minute.- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.Excuse me.- Miss?
- Miss?Don't make me run after you.
I have a toddler here!(GRUNTS)Are you the reason
that we came to Nebraska?I think that Flap should talk to you.We discussed that.I don't want to say anything
until he does, except thatI don't think there's an emotion
that you're having I couldn't validate.(SCOFFS)Tell you what.If you see Flap,
you tell him that his wife and his babywent to the doctor's
to get their flu shots, all right?Why don't you do that?DR BUDGE: Just hold still.- That's a good girl.
- Ow!EMMA: Okay? You're all finished,
all right? It's all over.If it makes you feel any better,
Mommy's gonna get a shot, too.- Can I give her one of those?
- Sure.- Here.
- There you go.Are they gonna tell me in the other room
if my husband calls?You have a lump in your armpit.- How long has it been there?
- I don't know.Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!There's two of them.
It's not very big, though.I have to be out of town next week,
and I hate to make it wait that long.They should come out and be looked at.Come out? Should I be scared?All it means is, if you're scared, why,you'll be that much happier
when it turns out to be nothing.Dr Budge, Mom should get a pop, too,
for her shot.- (CHUCKLING) Right. Here, Mom.
- Thanks, Mel.Well, I know what it is.You don't know how to keep yourself up,
so your sweat glands have clogged up.- It's a cyst.
- So I shouldn't worry, right?It's a cyst.It's right where your oil glands are,
and they've clogged up.You never did know how to eat right,
and you've never learned how to wash.You're right. You're right. Thanks.
Talk to Melanie.- Say hi.
- Hi.Hello, how are you? I sent you a blouse.EMMA: Say goodbye.
MELANIE: Bye.Okay. Say good...
Say goodbye to your mother.- What's her name?
- Janice. What did the doctor say?I told you, Flap.The scariest thing about it
is that he wants to do it so fast.Janice. With her little folder
under her arm.""I can't say anything until he does.
We've discussed it, Flap and I.""I mean, really, Flap!
""Validate my feelings"". Your taste!But that thing that the doctor said
about feeling good when it turns out...No! No, no. Forget about it.I'm not gonna make you feel better.
I'm too mad.(SHOUTING)
Dinner!- (SIGHS) Dear, you have a malignancy.
- Malignancy.- Say it again?
- Malignancy.Rosie.Rosie, our girl is in trouble.She had a cyst, a kind of a cyst,
and it turned out to be malignant.And they're going to take her
to a hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska.We'll release her in a few days.We do more and more
on an outpatient basis.We shouldn't need to take her back
here at all unless the illness escalates.- But you're not telling me anything.
- What are you confused about?How is she?I always tell people to hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.And they let you get away with that?Look, you're wrong to take the attitudethat everything is so desperate
and serious now.And it won't do your daughter
any good to get those signals, either.What's wrong now?I am so frustrated with that doctor.
But it all boils down to this.You're getting out of here tomorrow,
and you don't have to stay here again.Unless the illness spreads.
I really don't feel sick.Emma. I want you to come to New York
for a visit. My treat.Great. I mean, we'll have to see.You guys have to see
these letters from the kids.Look, Teddy says that he couldn't sleep
at all, but Melanie slept fine.Tommy says that he really doesn't think
there's anything to be concerned about.Hey, I mean it! You have some time
before you have to see the doctor again.Come see New York for a few days.I don't think it's a bad idea,
have a vacation by yourself.Rosie and I are here with the kids.- Take advantage of your freedom.
- I know you wanna go.This isn't like when they take those kids
to Disneyland right before the end?- Stop!
- Ow!- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Patsy, I'm kidding!Okay. Okay.Do you feel funny
about leaving the kids?I'm not leaving them.
I'm entrusting them to their father.Oh, I thought as long as your mother
and Rosie are in town...Not them. You.- Emma. Emma, look! Look! Look!
- Are we there yet?- Oh, God! I can't believe I'm here!
- Isn't it beautiful?Hey, I want you to meet
some of my friends.Not friends like you and I are friends.- Hi.
- Hi.Emma, this is Lizbeth.- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi. It's Lizbeth.Isn't that what I said?No, you said ""Elizabeth"" with an ""E"".
It's Lizbeth.- Two names? Liz Beth?
- No, no, one. Lizbeth.- Lizbeth?
- Never mind.- And this is Jane.
- Thank heavens!- Here, that's Melanie.
- WOMAN 1: Oh, look at that!Teddy's the younger one,
and Tommy's the older one.(WOMEN CHATTERING)LIZBETH: The little girl, she's incredible.Yeah, don't think she doesn't know it.Oh, Patsy's got a real thing going
with her. I mean, the boys, too.WOMAN 2: Are you gonna wait till she's
in school before you go back to work?Oh, I never really worked.- Well, that's okay.
- Thanks.(SIGHS)Great.WOMAN 1: When did she find out?PATSY: About a month ago.
LIZBETH: There.- What's wrong?
- Nothing.It was a great honour
meeting you, Emma.- I hope you have a wonderful time here.
- Thank you.I think those beautiful children are lucky
to have you for a mommy.Y'all go ahead. Take the first cab.
We're not in a hurry.- You sure?
- Yeah. That's fine.See you.- Bye bye, Patsy.
- Bye, darling.- You told them, didn't you?
- You don't mind, do you?Of course not.Emma, come on. They're jerks.
They don't know anything.Why do those women
have to act like that?Emma, talk to me!It's not you, Patsy. I don't care.
I don't mind them knowing.In less than two hours, two of them
told me that they'd had abortions.Three of them told me
they were divorced.One hasn't talked to her mother
in four years.And the one that has her little Natalie
in a boarding schoolbecause she has to travel for her job?I mean, hell, Patsy!The one with the yeast disease
that thought she had vaginal herpes?If that's fit conversation for lunch,what's so god-awful terrible
about my little tumours?Yeah, of course, but...
What do you want me to do?I want you to tell them it ain't so tragic!People do get better.Tell them it's okay
to talk about the cancer!Patsy tells us you have cancer.(SPITS)(LAUGHS)We should really talk later.I'm a nutritionist,
and my husband's with Ticketron.(LAUGHS)Thanks, Patsy.- Hello.
- Hello, Flap?- Yes.
- Have you heard anything?Uh, no. Emma hasn't called you either?No. How are the children?Oh, I wish I were so carefree.Yes, well, they don't have anything
to feel ashamed about.You know something, Aurora?You always seem
to lose your manners around me.Stop it, Flap. Let me know if you hear.And if you talk to Emma, don't sound
as frightened as you do to me.I don't sound frightened!Daddy.(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)Hi, Mother. Look, they're having this
party for me, so I can't talk for very long.But I think I'm coming home
a few days early.Not really.It's about time they gave us this room.God, Mother, I can't believe you did this.- It's great.
- Sure.Careful there! These are worth more
than you'll ever make in your lifetime.I grew up with her my whole life.
You can take it for a couple of minutes.This is fine. Thank you so much.Thank you.Hmm.- Oh, they're wonderful!
- They look good next to each other.Help me with this, Melanie.
Gorgeous isn't everything.This one. This one. Two more.The response to the drugs we triedisn't what we hoped.But there are investigatory drugs
which we are willing to utilise.However, if you become incapacitated,or it becomes unreasonable for you
to handle your affairs for a block of time,it might be wise
to make some decisions now.- Any questions?
- (VOICE BREAKING) No.I know what you're saying.I have to figure out
what to do with my kids.(SOBS)(SOBBING)Excuse me. It is after 10:00.
Give my daughter the pain shot, please.Mrs Greenway, I was going to.- Oh, good. Go ahead.
- Just a few minutes.Well, please. It's after 10:00.
It's after 10:00.I don't see why
she has to have this pain.Ma'am, it's not my patient.It's time for her shot!
You understand? Do something!All she has to do is hold on until 10:00.And it's past 10:00. She's in pain!
My daughter's in pain!- Give her the shot! Do you understand?
- Are you going to behave?Give my daughter the shot!Thank you very much. Thank you.Can I have 222, please?Let's get her!Pushing Grandma in
isn't a half bad idea.Don't you dare! I mean it.Come on.- Say, ""Hi, Granny.""
- Hi, Granny.MAN: Aurora?(SOBS)Well...Who would have expected you
to be a nice guy?(CHUCKLES)- Who?
- It's good to see you.(SOBBING)Take care of yourself. I'll call you.- I'm real glad I came.
- Your coming meant a lot to Emma.It meant a lot to me, Garrett.I'll be at the hospital all the time.
I'll call you.No, if I do that,
and there's someone there,I'll hear that funny sound in your voice.I don't care. Who cares? I don't care.I'm glad you came. I love you.Garrett!Come here.I was curious.Do you have any reaction at all
to my telling you I love you?I was just inches from a clean getaway.Well, you're stuck, so face it.I don't know what else to say
except my stock answer.- Which is?
- I love you too, kid.AURORA: Goodbye.I took him to the airport,
and we were standing therein front of the door hugging,
and kissing and saying goodbye.- And you know what?
- What?I got up the nerve to tell him I loved him.You know what
his reaction was, Emma?I don't give a shit, Mom. I'm sick.Not everything has something to do
with you. I've got a lot to figure out.- I just don't wanna fight any more.
- What do you mean? When do we fight?""When do we fight?"" You amaze me.I always think of us as fighting.That's just from your end.That's 'cause you're
never satisfied with me.(FLAP SIGHS)- Have you seen her yet today?
- Yes.I've been with her most of
last night and today, as usual.I haven't really talked to the kids yet.I'm not sure how much they realise,but they know
something bad is happening.Flap.Patsy wants to raise Melanie
and maybe the boys.I think they should be with me,
don't you?What can you be thinking about?Raising three children,
working full time and chasing womenrequires a lot more energy
than you have.You know, one of the
nicest qualities about youhas always been that you recognised
your weaknesses.Don't lose that quality now
when you need it the most.You have no right nor any invitationto discuss where
or how my children live.From what the doctor says,
it's time that we have the talk now.Do you know how much I hate
the idea of losing you?Yes.Well, nobody...
Nobody seems to know that except you.- I... Well...
- What?(CHUCKLES) I'm thinking
about my identityand not having one any more. I mean...Who am I, if I'm not the man
who's failing Emma?- You didn't fail me, Flap.
- I don't wanna talk about this.I feel like I'm sucking after forgiveness,
which I probably am.You were no more terrible than I was.No. Except for the cheating.You're right. Let's not do this.Look, we had problems.It was never over
whether we loved each other.Oh, God! That tie!
I can't believe you wore that!God, the mess it must've been
for you to find it.The house still isn't in one piece.
It was in the last box I looked in.(LAUGHING) I'll bet.God, you're easy to please.I don't know why I couldn't do more of it.I'm so glad we're talking, I just am.It just means so much to me that
we can still feel like this, so much.I swear...Listen, I am getting tired.Just tell me, hon,
you really want to raise 'em?I never thought I was the sort of man
who'd give up his kids.It's a lot of work.As hard as you think it is,
you end up wishing it were that easy.Where do you want them?I don't want them to end up with Janice.Well, she's not so bad.I really don't think
they should be with you, honey.Well, to tell you the honest truth,I'd probably screw it up.I'll really miss them.Well, maybe we should let
Patsy take them.Because it'd be very easy for me
to work research summers in New York.No. Patsy really only wants Melanie.
Mother should have them.You can see them any time you want.Y'all will decide things
for them and everything.- Emma, she can make that very difficult.
- She won't.(SIGHS)Well, (CLEARS THROAT) I guess
they should be with your mother.I probably have that coming.(LAUGHING)EMMA: Oh!Flap, will you bring
the boys by tomorrow?I've got that one waiting for me.
I gotta do it.- Yeah.
- Thanks.EMMA: Come on, Pats. I gotta get ready.Patsy. Make-up!(BOTH CHUCKLE)Is it terrible for me to say that
I can't stand seeing your motherget her hands on that little girl?I'd just love to raise that little girl.Look, I'd let you,
but Teddy couldn't spare her.(SOBS)I can't stall any more, all right?You go out there and send the boys in.- Well, do I get to say something ever?
- No.(BOTH LAUGH)We don't have to do that, right?
Come here.You'll be fine. You will.(VOICE BREAKING)
It's just this.(SOBS)You're my touchstone, Emma.The boys.(BED WHIRRING)Hi. Come on.I love you. I miss you.
God, I want you to come home.Close the door.Guys, you both look so gigantic to me.- I guess I look pretty bad to you.
- Not so bad.You both have beautiful eyes,
and your hair's too long.I don't care how long it gets in the back,
but keep your bangs cut, okay?- It's too long.
- That's a matter of opinion.Just keep it short, all right?Are you getting well?Mmm-mmm.Look up.I'm sorry about this, but I can't help it.And I can't talk to you for too long,
or I'll get real upset.I want you to make a lot of friends.And I want you to be real nice
to the girls,'cause they're going to be
real important to you, I swear.We're not afraid of girls.
What makes you think that?- Well, you may be later on.
- I doubt it.- Why don't you shut up? Shut up!
- You shut up.Teddy, give me a kiss. Come on.Tommy, you be sweet. Be sweet.And stop trying to pretend
like you hate me. I mean, it's silly.I like you.Okay, then will you
listen especially close?What?- You'll listen real hard?
- I said, ""What?""I know you like me. I know it.For the last year or two, you've been
pretending like you hate me.I love you very much.
I love you as much as I love anybody,as much as I love myself.And in a few years,
when I haven't been aroundto be on your tail about something
or irritating you,you're gonna remember.You're gonna remember that time
I bought you the baseball glovewhen you thought we were too broke,
or when I read you those stories,or when I let you goof off instead of
mowing the lawn, lots of things like that.And you're gonna realise
that you love me,and maybe you're gonna feel badly
because you never told me, but don't.I know that you love me.So don't ever do that
to yourself, all right?Okay.- Okay?
- I said, ""Okay.""Okay, you two should run along.
Take care.Give me a kiss.I was so scared,
but I think it went really well, don't you?Yeah?Tommy, if you need to talk,
your dad will listen.He's a very smart man, you know.All you have to do is
go up to him and say,""Dad, I'm confused.
I need to have a talk.""You know, I met this boy
back in River Oaks where I live.He was telling me that the Cub Scouts
in Houston are the best ever.We were never Scouts. Our mother
was too lazy to check it out.No! Stop!Come on! Stop it!No!Listen to me! Listen. It's okay, Tom.It's okay. Now... Hey! Stop it!I'm sorry, but I just can't have you
criticising your mother around me.(TOMMY SOBBING)Mr Horton. Mr Horton? She's gone.(STIFLED SOBBING)Oh, God, I'm so stupid. So stupid.
Somehow I thought...Somehow I thought
when she finally went,(SOBBING)
That it would be a relief.Oh, my sweet, little darling!Oh, dear. There's nothing harder.
There's nothing...Do you want some cake?- Why are you standing over here?
- I don't know.Come on. You wanna come over
and sit with me?Everything's gonna be all right, Tommy.There's fantastic dance schools
in Houston.- Tap?
- Tap, ballet, aerobics.Anything you want.
Come over here and see your dad.He really knows a pretty girl,
doesn't he?She's too old for him.Are you eating away at bunny? Here.
Better go on over to Dad and eat it.Hi, Vern. How are you doing here?I understand you're a swimmer.- Me, too.
- But you're an astronaut, right?I'm an astronaut and a swimmer.Pretty good-looking suit, there.A little closer. A little closer.A little closer.Do you want to see my pool?Well, I don't know if the time is right.
You know, funeral and everything.I think it is. Come on.I'll show you the internationally
infamous Breedlove crawl.Just a little stroke
I picked up out in space."
Grand Hotel|1932|86|Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery|Edmund Goulding|"OPERATOR #1: Grand Hotel.
OPERATOR #2: The line is busy.OPERATOR #3: Who is this?[All talking]OPERATOR #4: I can connect you
with room service.Hello.Is that the clinic?
This is Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel.How's my wife? Is she in pain?
Isn't the child coming soon?Patience? Would you have patience?This is Otto Kringelein.
Is that you, Heinrich?Listen. I've got to talk very quickly.Every minute costs 2 marks 90.You know that will I made
before I had my operation?I want you to tear it up.I came to Berlin to see a great specialist
about that old trouble of mine, you know?It's pretty bad,
and he says I haven't long to live.[Shouting] I say, he says
I won't live much longer!No, it isn't nice to be told things like that.You plague, bother, and save,
and all of a sudden you're dead.I want to get something out of life.I'm never going back
to Friedersdorf. Never.I'm staying here at the Grand Hotel.
It's the most expensive hotel in Berlin.All the best people stay here.Even our big boss, Preysing,
is staying here.I'm going to tell him someday
just exactly what I think of him.Hello, miss.This is General Director Preysing.
I want my home in Friedersdorf, please.Hurry.Hello. Is that you, Mama?
How are the children?What news have you
from the factory, dear?Is your papa there? Good.Hello, Papa, is that you?The conference with the Saxonia company
is set for tomorrow morning, Papa.If the merger does not go through,
we are in very bad shape, Papa.Everything depends upon news
from Manchester.If the deal with the Manchester
Cotton Company does not go through...we're facing a very bad situation, Papa.I'm Suzette, Mme. Grusinskaya's maid.
Madame will not dance today.She will not go to the rehearsal.
She did not sleep all night.There is something preying on her mind.I gave her a tablet, a Veronal.
She's sleeping now.This is Baron von Geigern.Look here, I need money,
or I can't stay at this hotel much longer.I've laid the groundwork.
I know the exact position of her room.I've made friends
with her ballet master, Pimenov.Listen, Heinrich.
I've taken all my savings, everything...and Im going to enjoy spending it.
All of it.It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
But it's wonderful.I can't! I'll lose my job.
It's like being in jail.Rely on me, Papa.
I will make this merger go through.I never fail.Poor Madame. Her mind is tortured.
I'm afraid she will...I don't need advice, thanks very much.
I need money!Music all the time. It's wonderful.Grand Hotel.People coming, going.Nothing ever happens.[Classical instrumental music]Mme. Grusinskaya will not want her car.CLERK: Mme. Grusinskaya's car
is not to be brought.BARON: Here.
BELLBOY: Yes, Baron?BARON: Adolphus is very vexed with you.
BELLBOY: Yes, Baron?You didn't take him for his walk
this morning.BELLBOY: The door was locked.
BARON: You should've knocked.That's why they don't like little dogs
in big hotels.The doors are locked.
They can't get out. You see?- Yes, Baron.
- I want you to take him for a good walk.- You understand?
- Yes, Baron.- Don't bring him back till he's exhausted.
- No, Baron.Wait a minute.It's quite all right.[Phone ringing]PORTER: Hello?
SENF: That for me?PORTER: No. Mme. Grusinskaya's car's
to be brought.PORTER: Mme. Grusinskaya's car's
to be brought.Good evening.
Will you send this to Mme. Grusinskaya?SENF: Yes, Baron.
BARON: Thanks very much.PIMENOV: Good evening. My key, 168.- Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
- Good evening, Baron.- How is the beautiful lady?
- Grusinskaya?To tell the truth, Baron,
tonight we're a little bit nervous.Were you at the theater last night?I'm always there
when Grusinskaya dances.- Last night was not so good.
- I thought she was splendid.Is Mr. Preysing in? I'm Dr. Zinnowitz.SENF: Mr. Preysing. Visitor.PREYSING: Here you are.
ZINNOWITZ: Waiting long?Waiting? I've been waiting for news
from Manchester.ZINNOWITZ: No news?
PREYSING: No.That's bad. You can't hold out unless
you merge with the Saxonia company.- I know.
- The Saxonia company will never sign...unless your firm is tied up
with the Manchester people.They don't have to. I told you that.Yes, I know. I'm very much worried.
But I have my agent in Manchester.I'm expecting a telegram any minute.You have to create a good impression.
Seem optimistic.Don't even mention Manchester
to the Saxonia crowd. Be clever.No, I cannot do that, Dr. Zinnowitz.I'm used to making my deals
on a solid basis.I'm an honest businessman,
a good husband and a father.I have nothing to conceal.
I could not live happily otherwise.Yes, I know.
We'll go someplace and talk it over.I'm expecting a stenographer.Send her to Mr. Preysing's room. 166.CLERK: Yes, Dr. Zinnowitz.DOCTOR: Letters for me?
CLERK: No, Doctor.DOCTOR: Telegrams?
CLERK: No, Doctor.He always seems to be waiting
for something...but it never happens.DOCTOR: No messages?
SENF: No, Doctor.BARON: Yes, I was in the war.CLERK: Your bill.
BARON: You're not beginning that again?OTTO: Please pay attention to me.
I've no time.CLERK: Kindly wait one moment, sir.DOCTOR: Has anyone asked for me?
CLERK: No, Doctor.CLERK: We're holding
five bedrooms and two sitting rooms.CLERK: How many in your party?
WOMAN: My mother, two sisters...OTTO: This is an imposition.
CLERK: Kindly wait one moment, please.WOMAN: That makes nine.
CLERK: Yes.CLERK: You wish to have the rooms held?
WOMAN: Please. And then...Really, I won't wait any longer.
I've been here a very long time.That's all right.Look here, I waited three days
before I got a room at all.When I finally got one,
what kind of a room was it?CLERK: A nice room, inexpensive.
OTTO: I didn't ask for a cheap room.When I came here to live,
did I ask you for a cheap room? Did l?CLERK: If you wait one moment, sir...
OTTO: I can't wait.<i>Every day is precious. Every hour...</i>MANAGER: 176?
OTTO: Every minute is precious.I came to live here for two weeks,
maybe three. Heaven only knows.I can pay whatever you want.
I'm tired and ill. I can't wait.MANAGER: Do you have a complaint?
CLERK: He's dissatisfied with Room 559.Yes, I have a complaint.
I think it's a perfectly fair complaint.I came here from a great distance
to live at the Grand Hotel.I want a room, a big room.The same kind of room
you'd give General Director Preysing.I'm as good as Mr. Preysing.I can pay for a room
the same as Mr. Preysing.Would you stick him way off
in a corner in a little room...where the water pipes go ""pop"" all day?He can have my room.
It doesn't matter where I stay.That won't be necessary, Doctor.Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176.
It's one of our most expensive rooms.A large room on the front, and with a bar.- With a private bar, exclusively mine.
- Certainly, sir.Exactly what I want. That's very kind.
I'll pay for it now.MANAGER: No, I beg of you, sir.
BARON: Pardon me, sir.You dropped your little hat.- Permit me.
- Thank you.Permit me. My name is Kringelein,
from Friedersdorf.BARON: Yes. I'm Baron von Geigern.
OTTO: A Baron.Permit me to present Dr. Otternschlag.A doctor. Doctor, Im ill.I know. When a man's collar
is an inch too big for him, I know he's ill.I must go and dress now.PIMENOV: I'll see you there.
BARON: Surely, sir.- Is this gentleman a baron, too?
- Unfortunately, no.- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here?
- I have signed once.[Classical instrumental music continues]CHAUFFEUR: Got a minute?
BARON: I told you not to come here.CHAUFFEUR: Time's getting short.Haven't I told you not talk to me
with a cigarette in your mouth?CHAUFFEUR: I want to speak...
BARON: Later.Yes, sir.BELLBOY: This way, Mr. Kringelein.Mr. Preysing.SENF: Will you go up to 166?
FLAEMM: 166.Hey, wait a minute!PORTER: Hello?<i>Mme. Grusinskaya 's car
is not to be brought.</i>BARON: She said,
""On the other side of the fence.""Baron, you're incorrigible.<i>Poor Grusinskaya.</i>PIMENOV: How can she receive anyone?
BARON: No, of course not.Theater, hotels, trains.
Trains, hotels, theater.- Quite so.
- I must toddle along.- She'll be waking up and calling for me.
- I'm sorry, old fellow.[Soft instrumental music]Who are you, please?I'm the stenographer.Then you will please wait outside, please.Yes, sir.Outside, please.FLAEMM: Take your time.Listen, the burial fund and everything.
I've got it right here.I'm going to live.
I'm going to have a good time while I can.That's my creed, Kringelein:
A short life and a gay one.A short life, Baron, and a gay one.
That's very true in my case.You know, I know you won't think
Im impertinent...but perhaps you might have
a little better time...if you bought some new clothes.
Started out fresh, so to speak.Well, Baron, I didn't think
there was time for that.But it's very kind of you
to take an interest.- Friends, then.
- Friends, Baron?Thank you.- Your room is ready, sir.
- Thank you.I may speak to the Baron
anytime I see him?BARON: Of course, Kringelein. Why not?I mean,
when you're with your smart friends?- I haven't any friends, Kringelein.
- You said me, Baron.- Friend.
- Bless you, Kringelein.See you later.[Soft instrumental music]I've often wondered
what would happen to that porter...if somebody jumped on him from here.I'm sure I don't know.
Why don't you try it and find out?- Thanks very much.
- Not at all.[Baron whistles]- Don't you like dancing?
- No. Not with strangers.- Never?
- Never.BARON: Thanks very much.
FLAEMM: Not at all.- I say...
- Are you back again?He must be an awful nice fellow.- Who?
- Whoever's keeping you waiting.[Soft instrumental music continues][Flaemm laughing]Have you seen it?BARON: Seen what?
FLAEMM: It.You don't mean 166?That fat,
bulbous neighbor of mine, Mister...- Preysing.
- Not you.Oh, no.Work.- Does he sing?
- I hope not.- Weren't you playing something?
- Yes. The typewriter.- You're a little stenographess.
- Yes, Im a little stenographess.That's fascinating.I don't suppose you'd take some dictation
from me sometime, would you?- How about some tea, then?
- Tea would spoil my dinner.I only have one meal a day,
and Id rather hate to spoil it.- Are you reducing?
- Reducing?Me? Do I need to?No. It's perfect.I don't think Ive ever...But why one meal a day?- Money. Ever heard of it?
- Yes, I have, vaguely.But I always thought
little stenographers made little pennies.- Very little.
- That's too bad.Did you ever see a stenographer
with a decent frock on?I have, indeed.One she'd bought herself?I see what you mean. Poor kid.BARON: I wish I were free tonight.
FLAEMM: Aren't you?- What?
- Free.No, darn it, Im not.But there's tomorrow.- What time tomorrow?
- 5:00, downstairs.Where downstairs?In the funny yellow room
where they dance.You're funny.- Tomorrow?
- Of course.Really?We'll dance?[Murmurs questioningly]All right. We'll dance.[Murmurs][Baron laughing]I wonder if I could remind the Baron
of his promise...that I might speak to him at any time?Mr. Kringelein, how are you making out
in the royal suite?- Wonderfully, thanks to the Baron.
- Baron?- Are you a baron?
- Strangely enough, yes.OTTO: Then this isn't the Baroness?
FLAEMM: Strangely enough, no.- Do I look like a baroness?
- You're attractive enough to be anything.Thank you, Baron. You're nice.- Thank you, Miss...
- Miss Flaemm.- Miss Flaemm, this is Mr. Kringelein.
- Hello.FLAEMM: They call me Flaemmchen.
BARON: I like that better.I wonder if the Baron would take
the trouble to come to my beautiful room?I've ordered some caviar and champagne.It's very expensive,
but that doesn't matter.Perhaps Miss Flaemm would join us.Have caviar, if you like,
but it tastes like herring to me.BARON: It does, as a matter of fact.
I hadn't thought of that.I'm sure my beautiful room...will appeal to your artistic sense.It has real velvet upholstery.A-number one.
I'm in the textile trade, and I know.I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?It has hot and cold running water all day.
Nighttime, too.I can have a bath anytime that I like.- No.
- Yes.Stenographer. Please.Her master's voice.
Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein. Thank you.Goodbye, funny one.
Don't forget tomorrow. 5:00.- I won't. Goodbye, you.
- Goodbye.- What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
- Preysing.- You know him, don't you?
- I know him?I've slaved in that man's factory
for years and years.<i>I know him through and through.</i>- Sorry, old man.
- I beg your pardon, Baron.Excuse me.
Won't you join me in my room?I've ordered some champagne.Listen, Id love to. I'll join you a little later.You know the gentleman
we met downstairs, with the face?- Who? The doctor, you mean?
- Yes.- He's a gay old blade, isn't he?
- He's wonderful.<i>Please, Messieurs, Madame is asleep.</i>See you later.OTTO: Waiter!
SUZETTE: Please.BARON: Sorry.[Soft instrumental music]SUZETTE: Has Madame slept well?No, Ive been awake, thinking.SUZETTE: It is time for the performance.I think, Suzette...Ive never been so tired in my life.[Soft instrumental music continues]GRUSINSKAYA: Not even the Veronal
can help me to sleep.SUZETTE: Mme. Grusinskaya's car
is to be brought.- I can't dance tonight.
- It will pass, Madame.Pearls are cold.Everything is cold and finished.So far away.So threadbare.The Russians. Saint Petersburg.Imperial court. The Grand Duke Sergei...Sergei...is dead.[Speaking Russian]It's all gone.<i>Mon Dieu. The pearls,
if they were to break...</i>The pearls don't break.
They hold together and bring me bad luck.I hate them.SUZETTE: Orchids again, Madame!No card. I think they are perhaps
from the same young man.He is at the end of the corridor.
Tall. He walks like a soldier.Madame must have noticed
how often he rides in the elevator with us.[Telephone ringing]<i>Yes? Oui.</i>SUZETTE: Madame, the car is here.
GRUSINSKAYA: Send it away.Mme. Grusinskaya will not require her car.No. She'll not be going to the theater.- Time for the performance.
- The performance.Poor little Lisebeta.She still has her stage fright. It will pass.- It's not stage fright. It's something more.
- What? What is it?- Last night there was no applause.
- There was.That theater, half empty.
Dancing for those few.I was frantic.I finished, I waited, I listened...but the applause did not come. Nothing.[Grusinskaya sighs]They're past, Pimenov.
They're dead. It's finished.[Banging on door]PIMENOV: Meierheim.Madame! In negligée
an hour before the performance.What's this, you're cancelling your car?
Do you know the time, or are we all mad?Am I your manager?
Have we contracts? Have we obligations?- Is this the time, or I am blind?
- I'm cancelling the engagement.Madame is cancelling the engagement?Madame has chosen a funny time
for such a funny joke.Tonight there is a line
in front of the theater since 6:00.The house is jammed to the roof.GRUSINSKAYA: Is it really full?
MEIERHEIM: Doesn't Meierheim say so?<i>Packed to the ceiling.
And such an audience:</i>The French ambassador,
American millionaires, Princess Retski...All right.GRUSINSKAYA: Hurry.
MEIERHEIM: We'll wait outside.[Classical instrumental music]Poor child.- How is the house?
- Terrible.After this, no more ballets for me.
Jazz. Just jazz.If the house is empty again...
I don't know.When she gets her paint on,
hears the music, she'll be fine.I know these people. Here she is.[Classical instrumental music continues]Why did you bring the pearls?
I said I won't wear them.GRUSINSKAYA: Take them back.GRUSINSKAYA: Hurry.
MEIERHEIM: We haven't time.I don't think Ill be able
to join you fellows after all.MAN #1: Why not? We'll wait.
MAN #2: Come on.- Lift, please.
- Wait.Can I help?BARON: You go ahead, old man.
I'll be there if Im up for it.MAN #1: We'll meet anyway.
BARON: All right.[Classical instrumental music]Mme. Grusinskaya's car.BELLBOY: Mme. Grusinskaya's car
is to be brought.The car is here, Madame.Hello. Fifth floor. Good evening.It's just 9:30, madam.Yes. I'll send them up at once.CHAUFFEUR: Is he in?
CLERK: The Baron?CHAUFFEUR: Yes.
CLERK: Yes.BARON: Adolphus, I have something
very serious to discuss with you.When you meet lady dogs on the street
that are not dachshunds...you must exercise some self-control.[Door closes]We have company.You're late.
The dancer's gone to the theater.Excuse me, Im busy.This is a very peculiar thing
for one gentleman to say to another...but as a matter of fact...you're the one thing in the world
I really love.CHAUFFEUR: She's gone to the theater.
Don't you know?CHAUFFEUR: What'll you do?
BARON: Pearls are in her room.The others are getting suspicious.I had Amsterdam on the phone.
They think you're scared.I've been careful. I'm waiting my chance.CHAUFFEUR: You're too much
of a gentleman, that's the trouble.I told you Id get those pearls tonight,
didn't l?CHAUFFEUR: Need any help?
BARON: No.Have you got the skeleton key?BARON: No.
CHAUFFEUR: Why not?One reason: There's a perfectly charming
floor clerk outside who sees everything.She'd see me enter her room.CHAUFFEUR: I'll deal with her.
BARON: How?CHAUFFEUR: Chloroform
on a handkerchief.BARON: No.
CHAUFFEUR: Why not?Poor kid. In the first place,
it would give her a rotten headache.I know all about chloroform.
I had it in the war.Besides, she's rather pretty.- She has a very nice line...
- You're no good for this business.BARON: No?
CHAUFFEUR: To you it's just a joke.I don't like your tone.- No?
- No.Get out. Leave her to me.Be ready to leave on the night train
for Amsterdam.- With the pearls.
- With the pearls.Get out.There is a nasty man, Adolphus.He'd eat his young.""Both parties have fully agreed
that this merger can only result...""in mutual advantages.<i>""Mutual advantages.""</i>[Typewriter clacking]""Moreover...""- Did you get that?
- Yes, I got it.What did you say Zinnowitz called you?Flaemmchen.- Flaemm? That's odd.
- What?I mean, who were the gentlemen
you were talking to in the corridor?Some people I know.- You know a lot of gentlemen, don't you?
- Oh, not many.I haven't time.
I'm busy now looking for a job.I'd love to be in the movies.Why the movies particularly? I mean...""...only in mutual advantages.
Moreover...""You're a very unusual stenographer.You're pretty enough to do other things.- I do.
- What?You see, I have a rather nice figure,
and I pose a lot.Art studies, you know?Like that? I got 10 marks for it.Is that you? You?Well, isn't that interesting?- That's lovely.
- ""Moreover...""""Moreover...""""Moreover, the possibility
of the successful accommodation...""for the Cotton Company...""should throw a great weight
into the balance...""""Balance.""Your hands are sunburned, aren't they?- Yes, that's from skiing.
- From skiing?A friend of mine
took me to Switzerland last month.To Switzerland?
That must have been very nice.I went to Florence once, too.- With the same man?
- No.Don't misunderstand me, Miss Flaemm.I'm a married man
and have grown-up daughters...- All right.
...bigger than you are.Come in.That's all. Excuse me, please.[Preysing sighs]""Deal with Manchester definitely off.""
Is that something terrible?It doesn't mean that at all.- That's a mistake. That's wrong.
- All right. I'm sorry.- Do you want to go on?
- No.You come back in the morning...and we will go on with the dictation
before the conference.If you find out you won't need me
in the morning...I wish you'd please let me know...because men like you who come in
and out of town are often unreliable.After all, if I don't work tomorrow...
Well, good night.""Deal definitely off.""Why, we could be smashed.[Car driving away][Clanging][Telephone ringing]MAID: I'm going into 170 now, madam.[Melodious instrumental music][Telephone ringing]MAID: Hello? No. There's no one here.You're late. What have you been doing?Everyone says, ""Come back.""
They won't get out of their rooms.[Telephone ringing]Housekeeper speaking. No, she isn't here.HOUSEKEEPER: Western Theater?
SUZETTE: You've seen her?Hello. Mr. Pimenov?Have you found her?
No, she isn't here. Yes, I know...Pimenov? What's happening?
No, I haven't found her.Who's dancing? Duprez? How was it?Good. All right. You keep the show going.This trick is going to cost Madame
a suit for breach of contract.- Madame is ill. Her nerves...
- What about my nerves?Who is she?
Where does she think she is, Russia?- I want to be alone.
- Where have you been?I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract.I just want to be alone.You're going to be very much alone,
my dear Madame. This is the end.[Melodious instrumental music continues]SUZETTE: Shall l... Does Madame wish...
GRUSINSKAYA: No, Suzette.SUZETTE: All right.GRUSINSKAYA: Western Theater, please.<i>Mr. Pimenov, the ballet master.
Grusinskaya.</i>Hello, Pimenov.I'm at the hotel.I couldn't go on. I couldn't.How is it going?Who's dancing? Duprez?Well, how is it?[Slow instrumental music]I see.They didn't miss me at all.Good night, Pimenov.They didn't even miss me.[Slow instrumental music continues]Hello.Yes. I'm sorry. I've finished.Finished.I always said Id leave off
when the time came.And who would trouble
about a Grusinskaya...who dances no more?What would she do?Grow orchids?Keep white peacocks?Die.That's what it comes to at last: To die.I'm not going to wait.I'm not going to wait.Don't be alarmed, Madame.Who are you?Someone who happened
to be hiding in your room.Why?I often come here
when you're at the theater.Why?Just to be alone in your room,
to breathe the air you breathe.There's no need to call for help.
Permit me. I couldn't help hearing.I couldn't help knowing
what you were about to do just now.I could have left by the window,
unnoticed, but I risked being discovered.May I say something, Madame?
You're so beautiful.It tore my heart
to see you in despair like that.What on earth
have they been doing to you?You've everything to live for.
Please don't cry anymore.You must forgive me.I've had a very trying evening.I was so alone,
and suddenly you were there.Why do you look at me like that?BARON: I had no idea
you were so beautiful.I'd like to take you in my arms
and not let anything happen to you, ever.How tired you are.Yes, tired.And alone?So alone.[Speaking Russian]You mustn't talk Russian to me.Strange man.Am I so strange to you?Maybe not so strange now.You know, once,
when the Grand Duke was alive...I found a man hiding in my room,
a young officer.Later on, they found him dead.Well, that was Russia.GRUSINSKAYA: Who are you?
BARON: Someone who can love you.Someone who has forgotten
everything else but you.You could love me?I've never seen anything in my life
as beautiful as you are.You must go now.I'm not going. You know Im not going.Please let me stay.But I want to be alone.That isn't true. You don't want to be alone.You were in despair just now.
I can't leave you now.You mustn't cry anymore.
You must forget.Let me stay. Just for a little while.Please let me stay.[Slow instrumental music continues]For just a minute, then.No, Doctor.The champagne,
and those girls and their dancing...those beautiful silver things,
and the ice, and the caviar...Oh, Doctor.I don't care.It's life. Life.Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk.- Good night.
- Good night.DOCTOR: No. My room.
BUTLER: Yes, Doctor.[Cheerful instrumental music]Mr. Kringelein, you're drunk.Life.[Otto chuckles][Cheerful instrumental music continues]Grand Hotel.[Belching]OPERATOR #1: Hello?OPERATOR #2: Grand Hotel.OPERATOR #3: Grand Hotel, good morning.OPERATOR #4: Baron von Geigern's room

No, Doctor. No messages.[All talking]OPERATOR #7: Grand Hotel, 820.OPERATOR #8: Grand Hotel, good morning.
Who is calling Mme. Grusinskaya?<i>Mr. Pimenov.
Mme. Grusinskaya cannot be disturbed.</i>OPERATOR #9: Mr. Preysing's calls
to 162 for the day.<i>The conference room.</i>That is interesting.A man in the textile industry
must know Manchester.There's a lot of business to be done
with the Manchester Cotton Company.They have the whole English market
right in their hands.Have you any connections
with Manchester?We have a lot of good connections
in England.- Actually...
- I mean, with the Manchester people.Please, we are here to discuss the merger.
Let us begin at the beginning.PREYSING: Thank you.Is Baron von Geigern in?Too bad.PREYSING: Since June 11 this year,
when the first negotiation...I met him yesterday.PREYSING: Between
our respective firms...Ive got a date.PREYSING: This merger can result...About 5:00.PREYSING: All of us.
FLAEMM: Dancing.GERSTENKORN: Tell us about Manchester.
PREYSING: Just a second.Before I get through,
Im laying before you here...the last general statement of the concern.The capital, the plant, the machinery...For instance, we'll take mop rags.FLAEMM: I'll call back.
GERSTENKORN: Tell us about Manchester.Yes, Mr. Preysing,
that's what we want to know.I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz...before I commit myself, please.Now, to go ahead with the merger.You realize...that this merger is a great advantage
to the Saxonians, of course.Now, let's talk like adults.- When you first approached us...
- We did not approach you.MAN: This letter filed in September
exhibits you approached us.That letter is a response
to a tentative feeler sent out by you.Tentative, my foot!A month before this,
your old father-in-law...- comes to me privately, and scratches...
- Scratched?PREYSING: We didn't take the initiative!
GERSTENKORN: You did...PREYSING: We did not!
GERSTENKORN: You did!Gentlemen, I see the conference
has already begun.- I'm glad you're here, Justice Zinnowitz.
- Good morning.ZINNOWITZ: Thank you very much.
PREYSING: I beg your pardon, please.Excuse me, please. I am glad you're here.These gentlemen have cross words.
Would you try, Justice Zinnowitz...- and iron out the situation here?
- Certainly.- Right here, on the top.
- If you will allow me.Thank you.Well, gentlemen, the situation
seems to be perfectly clear.- Yes. And how clear is Manchester?
- Manchester?ZINNOWITZ: Have you said anything
about Manchester?Why, no, sir. I cannot commit myself
at this time about Manchester.Quite right. Well, gentlemen,
since June 11 of this year...when the first negotiations for a merger
were entered...Now we're going to begin
at the beginning again.As you remember it,
when you approached us...GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.
PREYSING: I'm sorry, you did!GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.GERSTENKORN: You approached us!
ZINNOWITZ: Wait.Can you imagine 100 girls
in a ballet school...each thinking she would become
the most famous dancer in the world?I was ambitious then.We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.Then I became famous soon.But why am I telling you all this?Last night I didn't know you at all.- Who are you, really?
- What?I don't even know your name.[Baron laughing]I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern.My mother called me Flix.No. Flix.That's sweet.And how do you live?
What kind of person are you?I'm a prodigal son,
the black sheep of a white flock.I shall die on the gallows.- Really?
- Really.I haven't a bit of character. None at all.- No?
- No. Really.You know, when I was a little boy
I was taught to ride and be a gentleman.Then at school, to pray and lie.And then in the war, to kill and hide.That's all.And what do you do now?Now Im a gambler...running at large, like a happy pig...devouring everything of life
that pleases me.I really belong in jail.What a picture.And what else?What else?BARON: I'm also a criminal
and a hotel thief.That's not a funny joke.You must believe one thing.You must believe that I love you.<i>That Ive never known love like this
until now.</i>What is it, Flix? What's the matter?Hotel thief.No.Did you come here just for these?That's horrible.You may keep the pearls.
I don't want them.I will not denounce you.Hadn't you better go now?I wanted money desperately.Can't you understand that?
That's why I wanted your pearls.I was threatened.I was desperately in need
of a certain big sum of money.I've been following you. I've admired you.But last night, at last,
I managed to come into your room.And now...And now?I couldn't go through with it.Don't you understand?Don't you?[Knocking on door]GRUSINSKAYA: Who?
SUZETTE: Suzette, Madame.GRUSINSKAYA: Morning.
SUZETTE: Good morning.SUZETTE: Sleep well?
GRUSINSKAYA: Yes.<i>Come back in five minutes. I'll call you.
Five minutes.</i>There, it begins.[Telephone ringing]Hello, Pimenov. Good morning.Darling.Beautiful morning. Yes, very well.Rehearsals? All right,
you can come. Goodbye.I have to go to rehearsals.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.- Our train?
- Yes, for Vienna.- Vienna?
- You're coming with me.- Of course you are.
- But I can't.I'd give my soul to go, but I can't.GRUSINSKAYA: Why couldn't you?
BARON: I'll try. There might be some way.GRUSINSKAYA: Flix, is it money?
BARON: Of course.I have money.
I have enough for both of us.No. That would spoil everything.I'll manage somehow. I'll get it.
I have a whole day. I'll be on the train.I shall dance, and you'll be with me.Then we'll go to Tremezzo.
I have a villa there.The sun will shine.I'll take a vacation,
six weeks, eight weeks. I don't know.We'll be happy and lazy.And then we'll go to South America.
It will be divine.- Be careful going to your room.
- I'll be on the train with the money.Don't do anything foolish.- I'm alarmed about you.
- Don't worry. I'll be on the train.[Grusinskaya singing in Russian][Pimenov murmurs]Hurry, Suzette.
A bright dress. It's a sunny morning.[Grusinskaya humming]PIMENOV: Meierheim is cancelling
the Vienna engagement.Meierheim is mad.
You are mad. We're all mad.<i>Suzette, come.</i>PIMENOV: Gru, you're positively radiant.Pimenov, I have an idea, a ballet.It must have mad music...
But Ill speak with you later.You go to the theater.I want a full rehearsal,
ballet, full orchestra...- Come, Suzette.
- But, Madame...Will you get me
Baron von Geigern, please?Yes. Baron von Geigern.<i>Chéri, it's you.</i>No, nothing.Good morning.No.Just to tell you that Im happy.[Lively instrumental music][People chattering]I'll have something sweet and cold, please.BARMAN: Louisiana Flip, sir?
OTTO: Louisiana Flip?Yes, that sounds very nice. Thank you.What do you do in the Grand Hotel?Eat, sleep, loaf around...flirt a little, dance a little.A hundred doors leading to one hall.No one knows anything
about the person next to them.[Woman laughing]And when you leave,
someone occupies your room...lies in your bed.That's the end.ZINNOWITZ: Let me say again,
for the tenth time...you people were quite ready
for the merger.<i>You declared yourself fully agreed
on all the terms.</i>Why should the signing of these articles
be suddenly held up?I'll admit that we were at one time
anxious for this merger.But since then, the Preysing Company
has fallen on evil days.- Evil days?
- Very evil days.Say, listen.Haven't I just shown you here...what my firm exports to the Balkans?50,000 marks worth of mop rags
each and every year.Mop rags.We're interested
in something entirely different.- What?
- Shall I tell them again?Why waste time? It's getting late.- You see...
- We're going home.ZINNOWITZ: But Mr. Preysing has
great regard for the certainty...GERSTENKORN: You've been talking
all day. You're hoarse now.Good night, Preysing.You have decided against the merger?- Yes.
- The deal is off?Yes.BUTLER: Here's your coat, sir.
GERSTENKORN: Thank you.BUTLER: Here, let me help you.
GERSTENKORN: Thank you.Preysing, I hope you pull through.It's a very bad time
to be in such a crisis. Sorry.ZINNOWITZ: Dining in town?
GERSTENKORN: No, I have to get my train.Here! So you're breaking off
the negotiations.All right.But don't you think for one moment
that Im such a fool...as not to have something
to say about Manchester.GERSTENKORN: What? Manchester?No. The deal is over.
Good night, gentlemen.If you have something definite
to say about Manchester, we might...Im at liberty to announce at this time
that the deal between my firm...and the Manchester Cotton Company...has been successfully negotiated.Are you joking?
Under those circumstances...- Where are those articles?
- I thought it was all over.Under these circumstances,
it's a different matter.Yes, but under these circumstances
we might refuse to sign now.Now, come, come.
Business is business. Now, Ill sign in here.Preysing, you sign here.We should celebrate this
with a bottle of wine.Good night. We'll see you next week
and settle all the details.PREYSING: Next week.
GERSTENKORN: Come on.Good night, Preysing. You're a sly one.ZINNOWITZ: Dr. Waitz?
WAITZ: Yes.ZINNOWITZ: I'll be at your office tomorrow.You let me talk myself hoarse...and you had Manchester
signed up all the time. Why?- The deal has been put through.
- Yeah.The deal has been put through.- What's the matter with you?
- Here.""Deal with Manchester definitely...""definitely off."" Preysing!Yes, if that's what the world wants, bluff...I can be just as big a bluff as anyone.You must go to England yourself at once
and really see this through!Yes, I must go to England.
I was desperate.I didn't know what I was doing.
Now I don't care.This thing goes to a man's head.ZINNOWITZ: You need some relaxation.
PREYSING: Yeah!That's it! I want to break loose.I want to drink.
I want to maybe go dancing.I want to do anything.I can understand that, after this...Yes, go on, say it. My lie.But that's the first time in 30 years that...Where is my stenographer? Miss Flaemm?ZINNOWITZ: Why do you want her?
PREYSING: Pardon?ZINNOWITZ: What do you want?
PREYSING: What?Here. I want to do some dictating.I want to tell my father-in-law about...She had an engagement
in the Yellow Room at 5:00.She was in a hurry.- In the Yellow Room?
- Yes.Do you think that she's pretty?- Pretty as a picture.
- You think so?Let's go find her. We'll go get a drink.- You come along, Zinnowitz.
- Yes.I don't know much about women.I've been married for 28 years, you know.
Come along, Zinnowitz.- Good evening, Mr. Kringelein.
- Good evening, Miss Flaemm.- Have you seen the Baron?
- I'm waiting for him.I've been with him all day.
We had a marvelous time.We were in a motor car,
100 miles an hour, in an airplane.- Really?
- We had a marvelous time.[Band playing lively music]My, how you've changed.
You look awfully nice.Thank you, Miss Flaemm.
I had a manicure, too.Really?I'm sorry, Miss Flaemm.
Would you have something to drink?A Louisiana Flip. Louisiana Flip, please.- Absinthe.
- Oh, that.[Otto whistling]- You like music, Mr. Kringelein?
- Yes. I love it.It's so stimulating.- A man could...
- A man could what?- He could do almost anything.
- He could.- Hello, funny one.
- Hello.BARON: Sorry Im late.
OTTO: Baron, won't you have a drink?OTTO: A Louisiana Flip.
BARON: Mr. Kringelein, how are you now?OTTO: I feel a little strange, Baron.- I'd given you up.
- Sorry.OTTO: Please, Baron, do have a drink.
A Louisiana Flip.No, thanks, old man.
I'm keeping my head clear.- Dance, then?
- What?- Dance?
- Yes, Id love to.- Watch this, will you, Mr. Kringelein?
- I really ought to learn to dance.I suppose it's very important.Yes, you should learn
as quickly as the time allows.Believe me, Mr. Kringelein,
a man who is not with a woman...is a dead man.- What have you been doing all day?
- Chasing around.- Chasing what?
- Money.[Band continues playing lively music]- You were very different yesterday.
- That was yesterday.I served as a surgeon in the Great War...till the end.Grenade in my face.I carried diphtheria bacilli
in the wound till 1920.Isolated two years.- Drink, Mr. Kringelein.
- Yes.That was lovely.Listen, funny one,
do you want to make a man happy?FLAEMM: I'd love to.
BARON: Dance with old Kringelein.Why?I don't know. He's a dear old duck.
I feel rather sorry for him, don't you?[Piano playing]You know, you're not a bit
like you were yesterday.Yesterday?No, perhaps not.I fell in love last night.The real thing.There's no real thing. It just doesn't exist.I thought that, too.But now I know that it does.It's wonderful.Come along.- Dance with old Kringelein?
- Of course. Anything for you.BARON: You're sweet.Here you are. I must speak with you.- Presently, Mr. Preysing.
- No, now. This is very urgent.This lady has urgent business with me
at the moment.PREYSING: Insolence. Berlin manners.Good evening, Mr. Preysing.
You're staying here, too?- I'm sorry, but I cannot place you.
- Kringelein, at the plant.One of our agents.No. Assistant bookkeeper,
Room 23, Building C, third floor.- I am away, sick.
- That's very interesting.Good day.[Band playing swing music]FLAEMM: Would you like to dance,
Mr. Kringelein?Miss Flaemm, Ive never danced in public.- Come along and try it.
- I'd be afraid.There's nothing to be afraid of.
You'll love it.Miss Flaemmchen, I must speak to you.
This is about a dictating job.- When do we start? Tomorrow morning?
- No, right now.We were just going to dance.Do you know each other?
Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend
and not accept your invitation to dance.I couldn't think of not accepting
the invitation to dance.I understood you to say
that you reported to our plant ill...and you're here in Berlin
indulging in diversions...which are very much beyond your means?This is very extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein.I think we should look over your books.Come along now, children. No fighting.
Save that for the office.Does the world belong to you,
Mr. Preysing?Haven't I got any right to live?I will wait 10 minutes for you.If you're not back, it will be necessary
to engage someone else.BARON: What happened to your dance?We're going now, thank you, Baron.
Come along.I shall remember this, Mr. Kringelein.Let the poor devil alone.
Death's staring him in the face.I did not ask your advice.I think you'd better go away.We will see
who will remain here the longer.BELLBOY: Baron von Geigern, please.Mr. Kringelein, you must look at my face,
and not the floor.Yes.- Why, you're trembling.
- I never danced in public before.- You dance beautifully.
- Thank you.- That's right.
- I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.Are you really?For the first time in my life, Im happy.Are you all right?Yes. Excuse me, I just stopped a second.FLAEMM: All right. Here we go.I'm very tired. Do you mind if we stop?OTTO: Thank you.- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now.
- Must you?Yes, business.
One has to earn a living, you know.Not you, Miss Flaemm.Just another desk slave. Money.PREYSING: I'm glad you're here.
FLAEMM: Here I am.- Did you enjoy your dance?
- Yes, thank you.- Excuse me. Go away, please.
- Where's the Louisiana Flip?- Would you like a little cognac?
- Yes. You wanted to see me?PREYSING: Yes.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.Mr. Preysing, I am not taking orders
from you here.What is this insolence? Please go away.OTTO: You think you have free license
to be insulting?<i>Believe me, you have not.</i><i>You think you're superior,
but you're quite an ordinary man...</i><i>even if you did marry money...</i>and people like me
have got to slave for you...for 320 marks a month.- Go away, please. You are annoying.
- You don't like to see me enjoying myself.When a man's working himself to death,
that's what he's paid for.You don't care if a man
can live on his wages or not.You have a very regular scale of wages,
and there's the sick fund for you.OTTO: What a scale, and what a fund.When I was sick for four weeks...you wrote me a letter
telling me Id be discharged...if I were sick any longer.Did you write me that letter or not?I have no idea of the letters that I write.I know that you are here
in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.You are probably an embezzler.- An embezzler!
- Yes, an embezzler.You are going to take that back!Right here in the presence
of this young lady!Who do you think you're talking to?
You think Im dirt?If Im dirt, you're a lot dirtier...Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing!PREYSING: You're discharged.
FLAEMM: You can't do that.I don't know the man or what he wants.
I never saw him before.I know you.I've kept your books for you,
and I know all about you.If one of your employees
was half as stupid in a small way...OTTO: As you are in a big way...
PREYSING: What do you mean?MAN #1: Gentlemen, please! Please!MAN #2: Stop that!PREYSING: You're discharged! You hear?
OTTO: Wait!You can't discharge me.
I'm my own master...for the first time in my life.You can't discharge me. I'm sick.I'm going to die. You understand?I'm going to die, and nobody
can do anything to me anymore.Nothing can happen to me anymore.Before I can be discharged, Ill be dead!The man's crazy.
I don't know him. He's annoying.- Baron!
- Excuse me.BARON: What is it? What's happened?
FLAEMM: He's ill.- I'm sorry, Baron.
- Poor old Kringelein. You're all right.- Give him some whiskey.
- No.A Louisiana Flip.SENF: Five minutes to 7:00.
Time drags when you're tired.I was in the hospital the whole night,
walking up and down the corridor.They wouldn't let me see her.
And I have to stay chained to this desk.PORTER: Did you find that lady
for Mr. Preysing?BELLBOY: Yes, they're over there.
PORTER: That's all.His secretary.Come on, waiter.[Soft instrumental music]- Would you like a little cognac?
- No, nothing.PREYSING: Nothing?PREYSING: One cognac for me.
WAITER: Very good, sir.You wanted to see me?Yes. Pardon me. I must go to England.It's very important. I must go at once.
I have some very big deals...involving hundreds of thousands
of marks...and I thought
I would take along a secretary...to take care of my correspondence.You know what I mean.I understood you to say
that you travelled and...<i>You understand?</i>I understand you perfectly, Mr. Preysing.PREYSING: What would you want
for such a trip?FLAEMM: Marks? You mean money?
PREYSING: Yes.I don't know. I'd have to figure it up.I'd need clothes and shoes...and it's cold in England in March.
And Id need a suit.- You'd want me to look nice?
- Of course, Miss Flaemm.Yes, I thought you would.I should say 1,000 marks.FLAEMM: Is that too much?
PREYSING: No.That is all right.Would you like me
to get you a room here...at the hotel? Now?PREYSING: And that would...
FLAEMM: Hello, Baron.- Would you please pay some attention?
- I'm paying attention.BARON: How do you do?
PREYSING: Insolence.You mean the Baron?PREYSING: Baron what?
BARON: What?He's a gentleman.Is the Baron tired?No, not tired exactly.I thought this evening
we could go to the casino.That place we passed
with the wonderful bright lights.Kringelein, Id adore it.
I can't go anywhere.- What?
- I'm broke.- No, you're joking.
- Yes. Isn't it odd?A baron, broke.Excuse me, old man.- I quit.
- You can't.I'm not getting those pearls,
neither are you.- What about the money?
- I'll pay you back.- How?
- I have an idea working in my head.You might find a bullet through that head.If you do that you'll get nothing,
except maybe the police after you.MAN: Mme. Grusinskaya's car!If you wait, Ill pay you back your 5,000...Ill see you later.Go on, Suzette.Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight. How I shall dance!I want to feel that you're there.<i>I came too far.</i>- I'm worried about you.
- Don't be.- You'll be on the train?
- Yes.- Until then.
- Bless you.- Was the Baron joking?
- What?- Is it really true?
- What are you talking about, Kringelein?Is the Baron really in financial straits?To tell you the truth, I must get
some money somehow right away.- If the Baron will permit me.
- What?I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.Three hundred?If I could get into a game of some kind,
I think I might win.Gambling! I'd love that!I've got over 6,800 marks right here.If we could scare up some men to play.- We could go up to my room.
- That's a grand idea.Come on.- Cab, miss?
- What?- Cab?
- No, thanks. I'll walk.BARON: 4,000 marks.
DEALER: 4,000!BARON: Too high?DEALER: 4,000 marks.DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.Thanks.PLAYER #1: 8,000 marks.
OTTO: 8,000!BARON: I take it all.
PLAYER #2: That's a lot of money.I need it, thanks.DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.Baccarat.PLAYER #2: Too bad there.[Men chattering]- Now, Mr. Kringelein.
- Baron!Will you help me again, please?I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.- Make your bets, gentlemen.
- How much shall I bet?BARON: How much is left in the bank?
BANKER: 2,500 uncovered.- Do you feel like going that far?
- All that money, Baron?Come on, you're killing them tonight.
Go ahead, old man.Do you want a card?What have you got?The old highwayman. He has nine again.I win again!Come on, gentlemen. Please drink! Drink.It's wonderful and sweet champagne!Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?Yes! Surely. I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.Come on, now. Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne.It's expensive and good.What will I take the bank for?- I'll play for 500.
- Baron, all at once?Suppose you lose it?It's all the same thing, Kringelein.
Come on, now, old man.Deal me two cards.One to me first. One to yourself.One to me. One to yourself.Baron, if all that money...What have you got?I've got a nine!Isn't that a wonderful thing?Kringelein, you old robber,
you're hopeless.Baron! Baron, please.It's no use, old man. It's sweet of you...- but you have all the luck.
- It's true.I have luck, for the first time in my life!
I have luck!Baron, are you out?
Have you finished playing?Yes, thank you.I'll recover again presently,
in 10 or 20 years.OTTO: Look, Doctor. I've won again!PLAYER #3: There you are.OTTO: Baron, I win and drink,
and drink and win!Gentlemen, please don't go.Be my guests. Don't go. I beg your pardon.I know I oughtn't to presume,
but Im so grateful to you.It's been so marvelous.For the first time in my life,
Ive gambled and Ive danced.You gentlemen can laugh...but for the first time in my life,
Ive tasted life!- Splendid!
- Life is wonderful, but it's very dangerous.<i>If you have the courage to live it,
it's marvelous.</i>PLAYER #4: Wonderful!
OTTO: You don't know about that.<i>You're healthy and happy.
But l, believe me...</i>if a man doesn't know death,
he doesn't know life.PLAYER #5: It's a short life, but a gay one.
OTTO: Please, gentlemen, don't go.Come on. Drink to life...to the magnificent, dangerous...brief, wonderful life.BARON: Kringelein!
OTTO: And the courage to live it.You know, Ive only lived since last night...but that little while seems longer
than all the time that's gone before.All of...Take him over to his bed.<i>Turn him around.</i>BARON: How is he, Doctor?DOCTOR: It will be over in a minute.
OTTO: Over?OTTO: It's only just begun.
DOCTOR: Quiet, Kringelein. Don't be afraid.I'm not afraid, Doc.- I'm not afraid to die.
- There, there.You'll be all right.
Too much iced champagne.- What?
- Hello, Baron.Hello, Kringelein.You old drunkard.It's late.DOCTOR: What is it?
OTTO: My pocketbook.I've lost my pocketbook.
14,000 marks in that pocketbook.OTTO: I've got to find it.
DOCTOR: No, stay where you are.OTTO: No, Ive got to find that.DOCTOR: Kringelein!
OTTO: 14,000 marks.<i>14,000 marks were in that pocketbook.</i><i>I can't see anything.</i><i>You don't know what that money means
to a man like me.</i>You've never lived like a dog in a hole...and scrimped and saved.You did not see his pocketbook,
did you, Baron?No.My life hangs on that money, Baron.Nobody ever gives you anything
for nothing.You have to buy everything,
and pay cash for it.<i>I wanted to pay for my last days
with that money.</i><i>I must find it!</i>I haven't anything in the world
but that pocketbook!<i>Every hour costs money. I must find it!</i>Here's your pocketbook,
you silly old thing.BARON: There's your money.
OTTO: You found it!That's it. You found it.I'm very glad he got it back. 14,000 marks.Yes. It's a lot of money, isn't it?- Good night, Kringelein.
- Don't go, Baron. Don't leave me.- I must, old man. It's late, Im sorry.
- No. Please don't go!I must, old man. It's late.Good night.<i>Good night, Kringelein.</i>OTTO: Stay a while, Baron.I'm sorry. I can't, old man.I have no time.[Soft instrumental music]Wait a minute.- Hello, funny one.
- Hello.What are you doing here at this time?Looking for my room. 164.- Do you live here?
- Yes, for tonight.Oh!Oh.Such is life, Flaemmchen.[Soft instrumental music continues][Whistles]You're nice.Good night...funny one.Good night.Come on.- Thank you, madam. Good night.
- Good night.[Preysing snoring][Soft instrumental music]MAN #1: You were superb tonight.
What a success!Yes. It was a triumph, wasn't it?MAN #2: Madame will return
to Berlin soon?<i>Who knows, monsieur?</i>[Grusinskaya singing]Do be sensible.Shall I come and talk
about the music now, or not?No. Not tonight.Pimenov, go and find him.PREYSING: Flaemmchen.
FLAEMM: Hello.I've been waiting in there for you.I had to arrange about the trip.- You're very sweet.
- Thank you.FLAEMM: Won't you sit down?PREYSING: You know, you are entirely
different from what I expected.FLAEMM: Different? How?
PREYSING: I don't know.<i>I thought you were more of a coquette...</i><i>not so ladylike.</i>What did you expect?Wouldn't you like to call me
by the first name?No, I couldn't do that.PREYSING: Why not?
FLAEMM: I don't know.One can't get intimate just offhand.I could go to England with you
and all that, but...I always say that nothing
should be left hanging over.And names are like that.Supposing I met you next year and I said:""How do you do, Mr. Preysing.""And you said, ""That's the young lady
who was my secretary in Manchester.""That's all quite proper.But supposing I saw you and yelled:""Hi, baby! Remember Manchester?""[Preysing chuckling]And you were with your wife.
How would you like that?We will leave my wife out of this,
Flaemmchen, please.FLAEMM: Sorry.
PREYSING: I didn't mean that.You are very slender, aren't you?- Think so?
- Are you going to be nice to me?FLAEMM: Yes.- Very nice?
- That's what you expect, isn't it?You like me just a little bit, don't you?You're still a stranger to me,
but that doesn't matter.PREYSING: It's you, Baron.
What are you doing in this room here?- This your room, Preysing?
- Yes, this is my room.Sorry. I must've made a mistake.We shall see whether you made
a mistake or not.PREYSING: That door is locked, Baron.Yes. I came through here.Here. I want that pocketbook.- What do you mean?
- I want that pocketbook. Give it to me!- Certainly.
- So that's how we stand, Baron.Look here, Preysing...Im completely at your mercy.
I was desperate.It's a matter of life and death.I had to get some money tonight,
somehow.Yes, you did have to get
some money tonight...but you're going to jail.
You're going to be locked up.- Why, you're a thief!
- Be quiet.Quiet? Yeah, quiet!You danced with Flaemmchen when
I wanted to transact business with her.You, the nice friend
of the nice Mr. Kringelein.- Do you want to wake up the entire hotel?
- I will wake up the hotel!I'll show them what a baron you are.
You are a thief!I'll have you locked up.
Here, you wait here.Thief! You!Strike me, would you?OPERATOR: Hello. Operator. Operator.<i>They're having a nice little game up there
with that telephone.</i>Oh, God.PREYSING: Baron! Speak to me!PREYSING: Baron.He tried to rob me. He's a thief.Here, Miss Flaemm.Miss Flaemm, please don't leave me.
Please, Miss Flaemm.[Screaming]WOMAN #1: Look!
MAN: What a grand hotel!WOMAN #1: Hurry. They're waiting.
WOMAN #2: She was in a hurry.No wonder she was running.Mr. Kringelein!Wake up!Hear me? Wake up!- The Baron.
- The Baron?Go quickly. The Baron. Do you hear me?- Where?
- Preysing's room.Hurry![Sobbing]Here. Take it. You thief, you.I must get out of here.Mr. Kringelein, he robbed me.
He struck me. He's dead.Baron. Dead, just like that.Look. His eyes are still open.He looks so peaceful.It can't be so hard to die.That pocketbook he stole from me.It's just like it was.
I haven't touched nothing.Maybe he did try to take
your pocketbook...but you don't kill a man for that.You don't kill a man about a pocketbook.Poor Baron, he wanted money so badly.- Where is Miss Flaemm?
- I'll take care of her.That's it. She's working with that man.She enticed me into her room
while he robbed me here.- I'll tell that to the court.
- To the court?Yes.Mr. Kringelein, I must talk with you
before the police come.Miss Flaemm is in your room?- Yes.
- She's in your room.No one will know that I was with her.You were with her.They will not interrogate you.
They will not ask you any questions.You cannot give no testimony.
Neither can she say anything.But what you are proposing
is falsification of the evidence.My existence is hanging by a thread.A scandal with that woman
would mean ruin for me.- But you've just killed a man!
- That makes no difference!I beg your pardon.
It makes all the difference in the world.OTTO: We're going to call the police.
PREYSING: No!Please, Mr. Kringelein.I will give you money, anything.
You can go away. Please.- I have enough money.
- Mr. Kringelein, please help me.- My life is in your hands.
- Your life.What about my life,
when you had it in your hands?But I can send you back to Friedersdorf.I can give you a very good position
in Friedersdorf.Many, many thanks,
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing...- but I am never going back to Friedersdorf.
- Don't, please.Worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.No, Mr. Kringelein, please don't call...Hello! There's been a murder here.OPERATOR #1: I don't understand you.
Murder?OPERATOR #2: They're drinking.

SUZETTE: It's 3:00 in the morning.Tired, Suzette?SUZETTE: Is Madame not tired?
GRUSINSKAYA: No, Suzette.SUZETTE: Madame has changed her dress.
GRUSINSKAYA: Yes, Suzette.The music has stopped.How quiet it is tonight.It was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel.Those flowers make me think of funerals.GRUSINSKAYA: Don't they you?
SUZETTE: It's just nerves, Madame, nerves.Suzette, we're going to
take a holiday soon.Six weeks in Tremezzo.I'm going to live like a real woman...perfectly simple, perfectly quiet,
perfectly happy.- Yes, Madame.
- We'll have a guest.SUZETTE: Certainly, Madame.<i>But Madame must sleep now.
The train will soon go.</i>I suppose so.Call Baron von Geigern's room, please.[Humming][Telephone ringing]Keep ringing. He must be asleep.<i>Come and fetch me, chéri...</i>Im longing for you.I haven't been asleep.I kept thinking that you might come to me.But he must answer. Ring!Why don't you answer the phone, please?Yes.Yes. Ring.Where are you?[Men singing][Men laughing]MAN #1: Thirty-four!<i>Thirty-six.</i><i>Thirty-eight.</i><i>Forty.</i>MAN #1: Forty-two.
MAN #2: Let's go to work, boys.MAN #1: Forty-four.[Men laughing]MAN #1: Forty-four, forty-six pounds.<i>Forty-eight.</i>PREYSING: Are these things necessary?
POLICEMAN: I'm afraid so, Mr. Preysing.All right.CLERK: We've taken care of all that,
Mr. Preysing.The night porter's gone. You're late.SENF: I was at the clinic the whole night.- My wife, poor girl.
- The child hasn't come yet?No. But I mustn't let it interfere
with my duty.MAN: You won't forget?
PORTER: No, sir.- I'm going now.
- Yes, Doctor.- What's this?
- A killing in 166.Killing? Who?The big manufacturer Preysing
killed Baron von Geigern.SENF: Good heavens! What for?- I don't know.
- That's terrible!- He was a nice fellow.
- They say he was a thief.I don't believe it. He was a real gentleman.I know people.I'm so tired
I can't hardly see out of my eyes.No sleep for two nights, here all day,
and now this killing at the hotel.HEAD BELLBOY: Halt! Front!SENF: Good morning.

when he came along.SENF: Always friendly, an agreeable fellow.
PORTER: I'll tell you a funny thing about...Be quiet. Good morning, madam.Where are you taking that dog?- Baron von Geigern.
- Give it to me.Better take charge of this dog.
It belonged to the Baron.Yes, sir.- They have taken him away?
- Yes. Wasn't it terrible?Madame must not know. You understand?
Madame must not know!All right, I can tell it to the maids,
but I can't answer for downstairs.- Are you all right, Miss Flaemmchen?
- Yes.I was just thinking about the Baron.Lying there, with his eyes so open.You loved the Baron, didn't you?So did l.He was friendly to me as no man ever was.What if he was a burglar?- They don't kill a man for that.
- He was desperate.He was?He tried to raise money all day.And he laughed, poor devil.And a man like Preysing has to kill him.You know, I didn't like Preysing right off.Why did you have anything
to do with him?- Money.
- Money.- You don't understand that, do you?
- Yes, I do.- Do you really?
- Yes, I do.I could take care of you,
Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.I have enough money.<i>There's 10,200 marks in this pocketbook...</i><i>and there's 3,400 that I won last night.</i>That would last a long time.
I could win some more. We could travel.FLAEMM: Travel?
OTTO: Yes, to Paris.FLAEMM: I've always wanted to go there.
OTTO: Anywhere you like. Here.I'll give you this money
I won last night. 3,400...- and then later you can have some more.

We'll find a great doctor. He'll cure you.- They can cure anything these days.
- You think so?FLAEMM: Of course. You'll see. Here.Do you think you'd have
as good a time with me...as you did with Preysing?FLAEMM: Why, of course.
OTTO: Really?FLAEMM: Yes.
OTTO: You like me better than him?You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein.
A very good man.You know, I never thought
anything so beautiful could come to me.FLAEMM: We'll catch the first train

down at the Onyx?It's been a month
since you told him about me.And I know
'cause that was the nightVelma Kelly plugged
her husband and her sister.You know they say that she found
'em in the kip together?Gosh , if I ever found Amos
slipping it to somebody else. . .I'd throw him a great big
going-away party.It's getting late.I have been thinking a lot
about my act.Whenever I get a good idea
I write it in my diary.It occurred to me the other daythat all the really, really
knockout acts havesomething a little different
going on .Like a signature bit.And I thought that my thing
could be aloof, you know?Give 'em just enough
to get 'em good and hungry,but always leave 'em
wantin' more.Hey, once I get a name
for myself,maybe we could open up a club
of our own .You could run it,
and I could be the headliner.What's the idea?Wake up, kiddo. You ain't
never gonna have an act.Says who?Face it. You're a two-bit talent
with skinny legs.I'm just a furniture salesman .Yeah , but you got connections.-That guy at the club.
-There is no guy.That night. . .It was the first time
I set foot in that joint.I was collecting on a bet
from the trombone player.So you never
told anyone about me?Sugar, you were hot stuff.I would have said anything
to get a piece of that.And now? Now?We had some laughs.
Let's just leave it at that.You can't do this to me.Would you get off?You touch me again ,
I'll put your lights out!-Wait.
-Your husband will be home soon .Wash yourself before hitting
those sheets again .You're a liar, Fred .Yeah , yeah , so what?You lied to me.That's life, sweetheart.
That's life.You son of a bitch !

the murder weapon?AMOS : I keep a gun
in the underwear drawer.Just in case of trouble.That's just fine.

when you get on the stand .No, I gave myself up.
Surrendered of my own free will .Isn't he the cheerful murderer?ROXIE :
Shootin' a burglar ain't murder.Just last week,
a jury thanked a man .I'm grateful for citizens
who know the law.Get in there.You too.Sit down .Okay. From the top.A man's got a right to protect
his home and loved ones, right?Of course he has.I come home from the garage,and I see him climbing
through the windowwith my wife, Roxie,
laying there,sleeping like an angel .That true, Mrs. Hart?It's the God's honest truth .My wife had nothing
to do with it.She wouldn't hurt a worm ,
not even a worm .It wasn't till I fired
the first shotshe even opened her eyes.I always said she could sleepthrough
the St. Paddy's Day Parade.When I think of
what would have happenedif I went out for a beer
instead of coming home.It makes you sick
even thinking about it.BANDLEADER: For her first

to her dear husband , Amos.* Sometimes l'm right ** Sometimes I'm wrong ** But he doesn't care ** He'll string along ** He loves me so ** That funny honey of mine ** Sometimes Im down ** Sometimes Im up ** But he follows round ** Like some droopy-eyed pup ** He loves me so ** That funny honey of mine *After I shot him ,
he kept coming at me,so I had to pull
the trigger again .* He ain't no sheik ** That's no great physique ** And Lord knows
he ain't got the smarts ** But look at that soul ** l tell you, that whole ** Is a whole lot greater
than the sum of his parts ** And if you knew him like me ** l know you'd agree ** What if the world
slandered my name? ** Why, he'd be right there
taking the blame ** He loves me so ** And it all suits me fine ** That funny, sunny honey ** Hubby of mine *Supposing , just supposing ,

some cock-and-bull storyand how I ought to say I did it
'cause I was sure to get off.''''Help me, Amos,'' she says.
''It's my goddamn hour of need .''* Now he shot off his trap ** l can't stand that sap *- * Look at him go *

sensational activities. . .they think
they can get you $2 ,500.$2 ,500?Jeez, the most me

have the right representation .I always wanted to play

you can get me that?-Big Jim's?

take another phone call .How much is that gonna cost?You know how I feel about you .You're like family to me.

can I ask you something?You know that Harrison guy?He said that what I done
is a hanging caseand that he's prepared to ask
for the maximum penalty.-Yeah , so?

some advice.Especially from someone

on using for grounds?Grounds?What are you gonna tell
the jury?I just figured
I'd tell them the truth .-The truth?
-Yeah .That's a one-way ticket
to the death house.Holy Mother of God .Oh , relax.In this town , murder's
a form of entertainment.Besides, in 4 7 years,Cook County ain't never hung
a woman yet.So the odds are 4 7 to one
that they won't hang you .Jesus, Mary, and Joseph .You're talking
to the wrong people.What you need is Billy Flynn .-Who?
-Billy Flynn .He's only the best
criminal lawyer in Illinois.What he don't know
about juries and women . . .How do you get Billy Flynn?Well , not by praying , dearie.First, you give me $ 100.

from the guys at the garage.There's $ 7 00 from
the building-and-loan fund .$2 ,000.And that's all I got so far.But I'll give you $20

guilty or innocent.I didn't ask if she was
a drunk or a dope fiend . No.I said , ''Do you have $5,000?''

Mr. Flynn .On the other hand . . .your devotion to your wife
is really very, very touching .I took your wife's case,

my own horn ,but if Jesus Christ
had lived in Chicago todayand if he had $5,000

turned out differently.All right, this is what
we're gonna do.By the end of the week,
I'm gonna have Roxie's nameon the front page

-That's for trial .Nobody's gonna care a lickwhat your defense is

sympathy from the press.They're not all pushovers

that they can never resist. . .and that is a reformed sinner.So, what was your
favorite subject in school?Oh , I was a real dummy.There must have been something
you were really good at.I got high marks
on courtesy and hygiene.Perfect.
You wanted to be a nun .A nun?Where were you born?On a chicken farm
outside of Lubbock.Southern home filled with
every luxury and refinement.Where are your parents?Probably on the front porch
in their rocking chairs.Parents dead .Family fortune swept away.You were educated
at the Sacred Heart.Then you fell
into a runaway marriage.Left you miserable,
alone, unhappy.You got all swept up
in the mad whirl of the city.Jazz, cabarets, liquor.You were drawn

with the good ideas.I am sick of everybody
telling me what to do.You treat me like dirt.You treat me like I'm some
dumb common criminal.But you are.Well, it's better than being
a greasy Mick lawyer.Who happens to be
saving your ass!Who's out for all he can steal !Maybe you'd like
to appear in court without me.Well, maybe I could .Have you read
the morning papers?They love me!Wise up! They'd love you
a lot more if you were hanged .You know why?
'Cause they'd sell more papers.You're fired.I quit.Any lawyer in this town
would die to have my case.You are a phony celebrity.

-That's right.-That was the deal , right?
-Right.You asked me back.
I do all the talking this time.Absolutely, Billy.
Whatever you say.Mr. Flynn .
His Honor's here.Thank you .You ready?Yeah .I'm scared .Ah, don't be.I've been around a long time.Believe me. You got
nothing to worry about.It's all a circus.
A three-ring circus.These trials, the whole world .It's all show business.But, kid . . .You're working with a star.* Give 'em

with lots of flash in it ** And the reaction
will be passionate ** Give 'em
the old hocus pocus ** Bead and feather 'em ** How can they see

Amos.Amos, when did you file suit
for divorce?A month ago.Was there any reason
at this time?I'll say.The newspapers said Roxie
was expecting a little stranger.That's hardly grounds
for divorce, is it?A little too much
of a stranger.You mean you doubted
the paternity of the child .Well , sure.Tell me, Amos.
You share a bed with your wife?Yes, sir, every night.And you expect
this jury to believethat you slept
next to this woman every nightwithout exercising your rights
as a husband?Well , I could've
if I wanted to.-Oh , but you didn't.
-No, I did .-Did what?
-Want to.-But you didn't.
-Didn't what?-What you wanted .
-Wait. I'm getting confused .Did you ever question
Roxie herself?Did you ask her if you were
the father of her child?No, sir.But if you became convinced
that you were wrong . . .you'd be man enough to admit it.You'd take her back
if Roxie sworethat you were the father.-Which she does.
-She does?She does! She does!No more questions!You can step down now.Well done, Andy.Oh , Roxie, I'm so sorry.ALL: Aw![ Applause ]* Give 'em
the old razzle dazzle ** Razzle dazzle 'em ** Show 'em the first-rate

we've been waiting for.Roxie Hart
finally takes the standin her own defense.* And they'll make you
a star *Order! Order!Proceed , Mr. Flynn .Roxie,
I have here a statementin which you admit to having
illicit relationswith the deceased ,
Fred.Is this true or false?I'm afraid that's true.You're an honest girl , Roxie.When did you first meet
Fred?When he sold Amos and me
our furniture.Your personal relationship
with him --could you tell the jury
when that began?When I permitted him
to escort me home one night.I don't think
I would've gone with himif Mr. Hart and me hadn't
quarrelled that very morning .-Quarrelled?
-Yes, sir.Well , I suppose
it was his fault.Oh , no, sir.
It was my fault.I suppose I just couldn't stop
pestering him .Pestering him?
About what?I didn't like him working
those long hours at the garage.I wanted him home with me. . .to darn his socks
and iron his shirts.I wanted a real home
and a child .So you drifted
into this illicit relationshipbecause you were unhappy
at home.Yes. I was most unhappy.Roxie Hart!The state has accused you
of the murder of Fred!Are you guilty or not guilty?I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.I killed him .
I did , but I'm not a criminal .I'm not a criminal !Do you recall
the night of January 14th?Could you tell the jury,
in your own words,the happenings of that night?Well , when Fred came over,
I told him my good news.And what was that?That me and Amos
were gonna have a baby.And that it was all over
between us.What happened then?Well , then . . .Then . . .Did he threaten you , Roxie?Objection , Your Honor.
Counsel is leading the witness!Sustained .What did say
when you told him the news?''I'll kill you before I'll see
you have another man's child !''Could you tell the audience --
the jury -- what happened next?Well , in his passion ,
he tore off my robe. . .and he threw me on the bed .And Mr. Hart's pistol
was lying there between us.And then?We both reached for the gun ,
but I got it first.Then he came toward me with
this funny look in his eyes.He was angry and wild !-Wild !
-Wild !Did you think
he meant to kill you?Oh , yes, sir.
Yes, sir.So it was his life or yours?And not just mine.I closed my eyes, and I shot!In defense of your life!To save my husband's
innocent, unborn child ![ All gasping ][ Indistinct shouting ]-Roxie!
-Order!What a bull's-eye, huh?Order in this court!I'll clear this court
if necessary.There's pandemonium
here in the courtroom .Order! Bailiff!Mrs. Hart's behavior
throughout this ordealhas been truly extraordinary.Yeah , I bet it has.Opening her eyes,
she fans herselfwith her attorney's
handkerchief.-Handkerchief?
-Poor child has had no relief.She looks around bewildered ,
seeming to want something .Oh , it's a glass of water.Oh , Mama, that was my bit!I told Billy I was gonna
do that at my trial !But now her eyes
flutter wildly, and she --Mrs. Hart has fainted again .Oh, jeez.She slumps over, her chiffon
dress up around her knees,revealing a glimpse of a blue
garter with a rhinestone buckle.Oh , Mama, she stole my garter.-She stole my garter!
-Don't break my radio!First, the slob
steals my publicity.Then she steals my lawyer,
my trial date.Now my goddamn garter!What do you expect?These days
you get a little success. . .and it's good riddance
to the people who put you there.There ain't no justice
in the world .And there ain't nothing
you can do about it.Nerts to that.You think I got you up here just
so you can listen to my radio?People write some
pretty interesting thingswhen they think
no one's looking .Oh , Mama.The state
calls a rebuttal witness.[ Spectators murmuring ]Left hand on the Bible,
raise your right hand .You swear to tell the truth ,
so help you God?And then some.Have a seat.Would you state your name
for the record , please?Velma Kelly.Miss Kelly,
will you please tell the courtif the object I am holding
is the oneyou happened to come upon
in the defendant's jail cell?Yes, it is.I submit this as Exhibit ''X.''Roxie Hart's diary.I object!My client has never kept
a diary.And even if she did , this
would be invasion of privacyin violation
of the Fourth Amendmentand illegal search
without a warrant.Yeah .
And she broke the lock.[ Laughter, gavel banging ]Order! Order!Well , that settles that.
I'll allow it.What's the big deal?
It's just a bunch of doodlings.If you would read
for us, please.I haven't worked in a while.''What a laugh ,
plugging Fred.The big baboon had it coming .I'm just sorry
I only got to kill him once.''I never wrote that!You . . .Hey, she made that up!-Order! Order!
-She made that up!Please, Mr. Flynn ,
get control of your client.I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It won't happen again .Sit down . Shut up.
It's only making it worse.I have no more questions.Your witness, Mr. Flynn .Ladies and gentlemen ,
a tap dance.Miss Kelly, did you make a deal
with Mr. Harrison?Maybe to drop
all charges against youin exchange for testifying?Well , sure.
I'm not a complete idiot.[ Laughter ]Good . Good .Since you gave
such an impressive performancefor Mr. Harrison , maybe
you'd do me the same honor.-I'd be delighted .
-Thank you .''Fred assured mehe'd get me an audition
down at the Onyx.Then he reneged on his pledge,and that was my motive
for attacking him .''Pretty fancy way of saying
''He's a big fat liarwho welshed on a deal ,
so I shot him .''''Amos accused me
of having an affair. . .so I told him that the charge
was erroneous.''Objection , Your Honor!Mr. Flynn is twisting
this evidenceto draw conclusions
that are specious and . . .-Erroneous?
-Exactly![ Laughter, gavel banging ]Order! Order!Miss Kelly, do you know
the meaning of the word perjury?-Yes, I do.
-Do you know it's a crime?Yes.If it turns out that you knew
that this diary was a fake. . .I'd hate to think of you rotting
in prison for the next 10 years.Since you won your freedom .Look, all I know
is what I was told .Oh , so, all right.So you didn't find
this diary in Roxie's cell?No.Mama -- Miss Morton
gave it to me.She said someone sent it to her.Someone? Any idea who this
mysterious benefactor might be?No. She didn't know.All right, let's see
if we can work this out.Someone who writes
about reneging on pledgesand erroneous charges.Call me crazy. Doesn't that
sound like a lawyer?A lawyer who had a sample
of my client's handwriting .Mr. Harrison ,
didn't you ask Roxieto write out a confession?Yes. You're not suggesting
I tampered with evidence?No. I wouldn't.
Don't be ridiculous.No. That's thoroughly
and utterly absurd.Now that you mention it. . .Your Honor,
this is outrageous!I know. I agree.To even suggest
that the prosecutorwould make a thieves' bargain
with Velma Kelly. . .then fabricate the very evidence
that set her free!Just so you can win
another caseand move one step closer
to the Governor's Mansion !Why, it's simply beyond
all imagining !I'll hold you in contempt!No, it is not even conceivable!But if it were,
wouldn't it be time to say:''Come clean , Mr. Harrison''?Even in Chicago, this kind
of corruption cannot stand !Will not stand !That's enough , Mr. Flynn !I agree, Your Honor!It is enough !The defense rests.[ Rim shot, cymbals crash ]Ladies and gentlemen ,
this is Mary Sunshine. . .reporting live from
the Cook County Courthouse.The city of Chicago has come
to a complete standstill . . .as the trial of the century
finally draws to a close.Mrs. Hart sits quietly
at the defense table.Hands folded .Wondering what fate
has in store for her.And now a hush
falls over the courtroom . . .as the 12 men of the jury file
slowly back to their seats.[ Gavel banging ]Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?We have, Your Honor.The jury has reached
a verdict.Will the defendant please rise?What is your verdict?We, the jury,
find the defendant. . .Roxie Hart is innocent!
She's innocent!Get your paper!Roxie Hart is free!
She's free![ Gunshots, screaming ]Come on ! Move it!First she shoots the husband ,
then she plugs the lawyer.Don't you want
to take my picture?I'm the famous Roxie Hart.Hey, what happened?Billy, what the hell happened?This is Chicago, kid .You can't beat fresh blood
on the walls.But my publicity, Billy.
My name in the papers.I was counting on that.Your gratitude
is overwhelming , kid .I just saved your life.Yeah , and you got $5,000.And what do I get?
I get nothing?It's $ 10,000
once I collect from Velma.I get nothing?Oh , don't forget
your blessed diary.Hope you don't mind .
I added a few erroneous phrases.Sorry I couldn't tell you .Couldn't take a chance.I never lost a case.You're a free woman ,
Roxie Hart.And God save Illinois.What do you want?I want you to come home.You said you still wanted to.
And the baby.Baby? What baby?Oh , Jesus.What do you take me for?There ain't no baby.There ain't no baby?They didn't even want
my picture.I can't understand that.Why didn't they even want
my picture?* It's good ** Isn't it grand? ** Isn't it great? ** Isn't it swell? ** Isn't it fun? ** Isn't it? ** Nowadays *Ladies and gentlemen . . .Miss Roxie Hart says

Ben-Hur|1959|86|Charlton Heston, Jack Hawkins, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet|William Wyler|"In the time of the Messiah,the Roman Empire grows
to span thousands of miles.It is an empire nourished by bloodand secured by fear.They will take everything you have.They will invite you
to their games to watch others sufferand forget what you have lost.They will leave you with
nothing but bitterness......and desire for revenge.You should have stayed away.You should have killed me.I will.Don't burn out
your horse too soon.Three laps to go!Try keeping up, Judah!Don't embarrass yourself!Watch your back, brother!You're a prince, not a warrior!Prince Judah Ben-Hur, a Jew.Messala Severus,
his adopted brother, a Roman.They were as devoted to each
other as they were competitive.You're a cheat!Cheat? All is fair to you Romans!Oh, that's low!Judah's father passed awayholding onto the hope
that the two brotherscould be an example of unity
in this divided land.Cheat!One more lap to go!Judah.Judah!Judah!Help!Mother?Judah's hurt! Someone help!Mama!Nanny. Nanny, help.
Take him. Take him.- Careful, careful.
- What happened? Judah?Judah!- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Is he all right?- What happened?
- There was a rock.Mother?Quick, fetch a doctor for your brother.Tirzah! Run!- Esther?
- Yes, Father?Prepare the room for Master Judah.- Get water.
- Hurry, Esther.Careful, careful.Get some water.Up.He's badly hurt. What have you done?I haven't done anything.
It was an accident.Judah was thrown from his horse.- We were riding and...
- Racing!Mum...What should I do?You've done enough. Now pray.My son, will he live?- Minerva...
- He will recover.- The doctor reassured us.
- ...Mother Goddess,restore him by the skin.But, Mother, he looks
like he's in so much pain.Thank your Messala for that.Be strong, Master Judah.Wait. Wait.You are like an angel.Tirzah.Go to bed.Good night.We have different gods, Messala.Did we have fun?- Esther, dance with me.
- I'm not allowed.Well, we can give people
something to talk about.We can cause a scandal. Come on.Oh, let me help you.I have it. It's not your place.You know there's a whole
world beyond Jerusalem.Greece, Persia, Egypt.I just want to experience it.I'm tired of reading about it,hearing about it from travelers.- Are you?
- Yes.- But you make it sound so easy.
- It's not easy.But that's life.Tirzah.Could you help me
to my bedroom, please?You spend
too much idle time with Messala.If I didn't,
you'd have nothing to complain about.""Oh, have mercy on me, world!""Not one of my 359 gods
will smile upon me.""Don't mock.What's wrong with you?
It's supposed to be a celebration.It's a celebration of your faith, not mine.Well, that's the virtue of wine.
It doesn't discriminate.So what happened with you and Tirzah?Your mother doesn't want us speaking.And who cares what Mother wants?Your mother cares.And?- Listen, Judah, I...
- You have feelings for Tirzah.Messala, admit it.What am I supposed to do with them?You and your family are royalty.And what does that matter?I'd rather she was paying attention to youthan some other brute.Thanks.I'm not saying you're a brute,
I'm saying you're brutish.Oh...Simonides, go to bed. Messala!- You and Tirzah would be like...
- Like what?Like we were family.
We're not family, are we?Are we?I'm just a lowly orphan
your family took in.Oh, my God. Of course we're family!You're my brother.
You'll always be my brother.Everything I own is yours.No. I'll never have your name.And every time my name is spoken,it will be spoken alongside
stories of my grandfather.Until I earn it back.Messala, wait. Wait!Messala.- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Rome.Wait. What do you mean,
you're going to Rome?Messala, stop.The Emperor's called for men to put
down the rebellion in Germania.He's called for idiots to fight and die.I can't believe this.After everything we've done for you,you still want to go and fight
for those murderers!The pay's steady.""The pay's steady""?So I can come back to Tirzah
with stature and wealth.But wealth doesn't mean anything.- It never does if you're rich.
- Messala, please.Look, tell Tirzah...If you have something
to say to her, say it yourself.Otherwise you're just walking away.Judah?Where's Messala?Messala,I hope this letter finds
you well, if at all.As with all the others
I've sent over the past three years,I expect no response.I can only hope that it is by your choice
and not by the way of your demise.I always prefer
not to see my food before I eat it.That's probably the best idea.You would hardly recognize
your Jerusalem now.What? What are you looking at?The circus.The Romans continue
to leave their markand build their circus.When you come home,
I will honor the monstrosityby humiliating you in one of those
chariots you Romans so love.Yes, of course.But, brother, I do have news to tell you.Here, try it.Two months ago,Esther's father found
a wealthy Roman for her to marry.- Hmm.
- Hmm.We still have to find you
something special.Oh, no, that's okay. I don't want anything.I gave my blessing knowing
in my heart it was a mistake.I was reminded of how
I used to jest to Motherthat one day we would wed...Go with God....knowing the thought
of her son, a prince,marrying a servant
would send her to an early grave.I couldn't let her go.If you leave me,
you leave me with nothing.She is now my wife, brother.Despite the wonderful life
we have together,Rome has come to lay
a hard hand on the city.Repeated attacks have left
them with little patience.Thankfully,
we've been able to retain their favor.Well, for now.Hear my plea.Be safe. Return home.I will listen to stories of your travels.Judah.- What have you found?
- I don't know what it is.I know what this is!
This is a Senet board.- How much for this?
- Five shekels.A Zealot,
and that he will be subject todayto the customary punishment
of crucifixion.- No!
- May his punishmentstand as a warning.- Ah, the Zealots.
- All they want is freedom.And at what cost?If they had their way,they'll bring the whole
of Rome down on us.Then where will our freedom be?- How much is it? Five?
- Thank you, My Lord.There's freedom elsewhere.Excuse me?Love your enemies.""Love your enemies.""
Well, that's very progressive.It's the truth.God is love.
He made us to share that love.And where will your love be
when the Romansturn their anger on the rest of us?Hate and fear are lies.They turn us against each other.Those are the lies that make us slaves.He has a path planned for you.If He has a path planned for me,how am I better off than a slave?Why don't you ask her?Esther.There's truth to what he's saying.There must be something better.Better than what?Look around you.The roads are lined
with the sick and poor.We should be grateful
we're not one of them.- Can you spare something, please?
- We can be more than grateful.Esther, I'm not denying
the fact that the world is a cruel place.But it's our responsibility
to take care of ourselvesand the ones we love.If people took care
of themselves, we'd all be saved.If God is righteous,
then we should do righteous things.If there is a God, then why
doesn't He do right by the world?Come. Follow me.Follow me.
Follow me. This way.Let's go. Stay with me.Who's there?Jacob, stop. He's my brother.Put the knife down.Put it down.Judah.- What happened to him?
- He's wounded.- Yes, I can see that. How?
- The cemetery.Romans take the stones of our ancestorsto build their circus.Not anymore.- You're Zealots!
- We fight for your freedom.From what I can see,
you get young boys injured.We need a doctor.No, a doctor would
inform the centurions.Go and get a candle. Go.I need your knife.What's your name?- Dismas.
- Dismas.I hope you're proud of yourselves.You know our aim.Independence from Caesar,
ending the occupation of the Holy Land.- By killing Romans?
- We settle scores.Not here. Not in Jerusalem.Dismas, it's a little bit
of pain and then it's done.Let me see.You're a part of this?The man you love is a Roman!We don't kill all Romans.Well, that's not very
comforting to the dead ones.If your father was alive,
he would support us.You, I don't know,
so you can shut your mouth.This is your home,
this is your land, too.They turn our brothers into slavesand that doesn't move you?Killing doesn't get us up from under.- Being passive has done what?
- It keeps the peace.You confuse peace with freedom.Jacob.The High Priests,
you in the privileged class...You get Caesar's favor
in exchange for obedience.The rest of us get scraps.I won't condone violence.Nobody's asking your permission.You keep my family
and my house clean of this.Now get out.- The boy?
- He's safe here.Safer than with you.I said get out!You know, Mother has
hopes for a grandchild.She asks me every day. I tell her, ""Soon.""But I know ""soon""
isn't soon enough for her.That sounds wonderful.Judah Ben-Hur?- Yes?
- Follow us.Where are you taking him?Don't worry, we've done nothing wrong.It's all right, go inside.I've brought the Jew.I haven't changed that much, have I?You look like one of those statuesyou Romans insist on
putting everywhere.You look like the clay
they make them from.Statues are made of marble, not clay.Not the one they'd make of you.Look at this.Wow.Well, come on, tell me.
Tell me everything.Up Mars!Move forward!Move forward!I'm not sure
you want to hear everything.And you were right
about life as a soldier.Sleepless nights in the mud.
Cold and wet.Drusus, move forward!- If we stay here, we'll die!
- Then you go!One night in Persia...Your name?...I met him.- Your name!
- Messala Severus.Captain Messala Severus.
These are your men now.- Start leading!
- Sir!His name was Pontius Pilate.He gave me a chance.He reminded me of
what we were fighting for.Things you and I believe in, Judah.A civilized world, progress,
prosperity, stability.I battled and marched through countriesand across continents
I'd once dreamed of.I led my men from battle to battle,
to the heights of glory.But we crushed the freedom
of innocent civilizationssimply because they were different.I saw much blood spilled.More than I can describe.Attention!My true fight became
with my commander,Marcus.Why haven't you attacked the city?An attack wasn't needed.
My orders were to pacify the city.Leaving no able-bodied man alive.Well, who will till the field or harvest...We need to stamp out
revolt in every corner of the Empire.If you want to offer up
another lifeless husk- to the Empire...
- Messala Severus?We've heard the stories
about your grandfather.His hand in betraying Julius Caesar.And how he wailed
when he was crucified.In spite of that,
I'm thankful Pilate's on my side, brother.More thankful to see you.Me, too.To think you were just
a lowly Hur before you left.Well, Mother missed you every day.Ah, I'm sorry I left you alone with her.Tirzah?How is she?Tirzah's good, she's well.Judah, will you tell her...No, you can tell her yourself.
She's not yet married.My God, you still have it.Why didn't you write?What would I say?I don't know.
That you're alive? That you're well?Anything would have sufficed.Judah,I had to be able to come back
on my own terms.Your family gave me everything.I wanted to be able to return the favor.Now I can.Mmm. Judah, listen.- I need your help.
- Messala.You're needed outside.
There's been another attack.Stretcher bearer, over here.What's being said about Pontius Pilate?To be honest, nothing good.In a few days, he wants
to ride through Jerusalemat the head of a legion.Why?The Zealots.I've tried to deal with them peacefully.
Peace doesn't work.- So now you try a legion.
- That's not my choice.All they want from Rome
is their land back.It was never their land.
It belonged to you, the wealthy.You don't really believe
in a return to the Age of Solomon.When the Zealots
are done with us, they'll turn on you.I don't care about their politics.
I just care about keeping the peace.Then we're agreed!Look, Zealots are the common enemy.Listen, you're a prince.
You have the ear of your people.Pontius Pilate has to
ride through Jerusalem with no trouble.That's all I'm asking.Brother, I've been away a long time.If I come back now,
believe me, it's important.I want to give you this.I've done a lot of work with this.It would give me nothing but joyto know it was in your hands
and lay forever idle.I'll speak to my people,
find out what I can.Thank you.- But you must come to dinner.
- I will.But nothing special. Just a simple meal.I promise. A simple meal.What's this about?There's been an attack
at the cemetery. Zealots.Breathing still?This is Vilarius. I know him.Pull him out. Brother...Lost quite a bit of blood.Messala.What happened, Lucius?Zealots.They poured through
the encampment under cover of night.We had no way of...The people's gratitude
for your bloodless suppression.What were your men doing here?Orders were to gather stones
to build the circus.You understand this is sacred land.These are Judean graves.I'm informing Pilate.If you rule as occupiers,
you will be met with disaster, I promise.Are you as treasonous
as you are useless?That's my brother's bow.You should be resting.I'm fine.I need to redress the wound.Sit.Well, if you want to
call anywhere home again,you'll need to be more careful.The people you run with now are trouble.I see they've sold you
on the romance of fighting,but the reality is very different.How would you know?I know when I found you,
you were almost dead.And for what?So you can say
you evened up with the Romans?We're not trying to balance anything.We want the freedom we were born with.And if the Romans won't give it to us,
we'll have to take it by force.How many Romans do you even know?Have you ever had a conversation
with a single one in your life?Don't spit your hate for all
when you don't even know one.Now, you're welcome to stay
here as long as you need.When you're well,
you should go back to your family.I should.But my father was able-bodied,
so the Romans killed him.My mother was fertile,
so they did other things to her.Everybody, just act normal.He's coming.Oh, for God's sake, more normal.Welcome home.This is Captain Drusus,
my second-in-command.- Greetings.
- To you, Prince.I owe this man my life.We have something in common, at least.I have a small gift from my travels.The finest silk in all of Egypt.It reminded me of you.Your return is gift enough for me.Soyou never got married.Don't they teach subtlety
in Caesar's army?You must have a hundred men
fighting over you.A few.But you spoiled me for others.- Oh, don't say that!
- It's true.Well, you should be happy.
You deserve to be.I know. I look like a monster.Nothing like one.You know this scar, of course.- This one I got in Germania.
- Germania?The other one I can't show you. I...I was run through,
I thought fatally, and...As I lay there, I...I wished I could see you again.Talk to you one last time.Messala!Let me show you something.I may kill your brother one day.I may kill him first.You know, your mother
used to interrupt us.Now you do.- We have a lot to catch up on.
- Indeed.It is striking.Now tell me something
honestly. Look me in the eyes.How many men does it take
to get you dressed in the morning?- That's an honest question.
- Yeah.Doesn't he look just like Zeus?You know, he's twice as fast, though.And I knew you'd appreciate him.Cost me a small fortune.He really is a beautiful horse.Yes, he is.So you spoke with your people.Yes. I spoke to some of the local rabbisand opinion makers,
and most of them want peace.So who's against us?Some local thugs and radicals.
No one of any importance.Right, but who?Messala, they don't matter.But, Judah, if they don't matter,
then tell me who they are.What are their names?I'm not going to name names.So you're going to stand idle,even though you know who the guilty are.To be honest, no one's guilty of anything
except being sick of Rome's oppression.Are you aware who's riding to this city?Did I make that clear?Death or peace.I've tried every other way.And they spit my grandfather's
name in my face- and ridicule me!
- Oh, my God.After all these years, you still sound likethat Roman orphan who
turned up on our doorstep.Judah, you promised to help me!No, I said I would speak
to the people. And I have.I don't need you to speak to them.
I need you to sway them.And if you can't do that,then I need you to tell me
who our enemies are.Because we've run out of time.Judah, please.Please, I need you to help me.Messala, I won't be bullied
into this decision.Judah!- Messala! Dinner!
- Oh...Come on, let's get something to eat.This is how Jerusalem welcomes us?Tribune Messala has promised
there'll be no trouble.I've spoken to prominent citizens.Your safety is their highest priority.What is that?- Stay here.
- Why?Please.Tirzah?Tirzah, wait for me.No!Sir!Testudo!- Testudo!
- Protect!Shields up!Ready arrows!Judah!Down! Mother, get Tirzah down!Find the ones who did this and kill them!You're responsible! Fix it!Tirzah, move! Get inside. Inside!Move!Step aside!Open this door!Break down the door.Open the door!Open this door!Dismas!What have you done?Do you realize what you've just done?Then get ready
to down this door!- Run!
- Take cover!Go. Go!We're friends of Rome.This house is sovereign. This house...Simonides!On the ground
with all of them!- Search every room.
- Mother!Drag every one
of them in here, now!I have to speak
to Messala Severus. He knows me!If they resist, kill them.- Come with me!
- Please, don't leave them!- Tirzah!
- Get down here!What are you doing?
Leave my daughter alone!Wait, please! Please! No!Please!Listen to us!I'll take all collaborators!Judah!Who shot the arrow?Who shot the arrow?Who shot...No, wait! Please!Wait!Confess your crime!We've done nothing.
We've done nothing!Confess your crime,
or they all stand accused!Accused of what?Messala!Messala, help us!Messala, please help us!Search every room!Messala!The arrow!Who shot the arrow?Who shot the arrow?Brother, don't!Ah, here's your friend.Messala?Messala, please help us.So you don't harbor Zealots.Messala? Messala?No one here has done anything.
I beg you, please,defend this house.You make the order.It was me.It was me, I did it. I confess!Judah, what are you doing?Please, take me.My family, they have done nothing wrong.I confess, please.He's confessed.Zealots don't use women, Marcus.There's no reason to keep them here.You promised entry without incident.Did you lie or do you collaborate?- You're calling me a traitor?
- Messala, what's the order?Messala, please don't do it.Take them all.Take them all!- Come on then.
- No!Get up. On your feet.No!Be quick about it.
Bring the servants, too.Please, Messala! No!Drusus, this is insanity!
You know we've done nothing wrong.Women to the cross, men to the galleys!- No! No!
- Judah!I've taken the blame!I've taken the blame!
I've taken the blame!Stop it.Calm down, Judah!Stay back.Stay back!Stay back! I'll kill him!I'll kill him.I swear, I'll kill him!It won't save them.Where have they taken them?- Where are they?
- They're gone.They're beyond us both.Step back!They'll kill them.Messala, please, I'm begging you.I begged you!I asked you
brother-to-brother to help me.And you chose the traitors over me!And they betrayed you.Rome's calling for blood.
I have to give them some.Look at me, please, brother.I would never do this to you.
I would never...You killed them both.Whatever happens now, you did this!Keep moving!All the way back. Back!Judah!Judah!Esther.Where are you going?- Hold!
- Please!- On your feet.
- Please show mercy!On your feet!I said on your feet!- Not here.
- Please, he needs water.- Please!
- No water for him!Someone help us.Drink.Thank you.You would do the same.Get up, Judah.- Now.
- Move.Judah!- Where are you taking them?
- To the Port of Tyrus.To the galleys?- You can't!
- My family.Judah.- Move!
- Go on.Move! Move!Number 61.Sit down.Sit down.Starboard side clear!Stand by, bow!Hands on.Let's lift the line, oarsmen!Please, sir, this has been a mistake.- My family, they're innocent...
- You won't see them again.Not in this life.- Put it down!
- Follow me now!Drum! And...Row!Trident!Move!Wake up!Quickly.Ionian water!Contact imminent!Give yourselves over to the drum!Why are we so slow?We will not lose this battle
before we start.- Ladder down!
- Coming down!Prepare for battle!Full speed! Stick to it!Oars up.Oars up!Why are we so slow?We need to wake them up.Change him out.- No, please. Please, I'm fine.
- Get out!I'm... Please.- I said, out!
- Please!You're done!- Get out!
- I can row! I am a strong man.- Give me that!
- I beg you. No, please!Enough!No, don't.Take him out.Don't care.Just survive.Forget about them!For there is no ""you"" anymore!This ship is your body.That drum is your heartbeat!And your godis the glory of Rome!If this ship goes down,so do you.Chains.Raise the trident!Free to engage! Quickly!Ready!Get ready!Chains!You, too!Catapults ready!Fire pit ready! Open the oil barrels!We should do something.- We should do something.
- We should.When they pass,
you should bow your head.When they strike, take it.You can't beat them.Climb the ladder!All you can do is outlive them.We ram! We ram hard!Reverse with everything we have.Oars!Sink them.Not one Greek will step aboard my ship.Do you understand me?Drum!All together!And...Row!- Catapults.
- Catapults ready!Fireballs.And move!Let us make this
a glorious dayfor Rome!Battle speed!Battle speed!Approaching!Twenty-nine!Twenty-eight!Twenty-seven!In the pitch!Twenty-five!Ramming speed!Ramming speed!Twenty-two!Twenty-one! Twenty!Ship down
on the starboard side!Thirteen!Twelve!Eleven! Ten!Blades in!Brace for impact!Drum! Where's the drum?Reverse!And row!Greeks on board!Reverse!Reverse!Reverse on my count!- Help me!
- Die!Hands on! Hands on oar!Arrows!Watch the oil!Keep rowing
if you want to live!- All hands on deck!
- Reverse!Keep rowing!Pull back!Heed my drum!Keep rowing if you want to live!Get away from me!All you Romans will die!Keep rowing!This is a Greek sea now!Reverse!Reverse!We need to keep moving.We need to keep moving!Everyone! Listen to me!
We need to keep moving!If we stay idle, we all die.Hands on oars!Hands on oars! On my count!And row!And...Row!Together...And row!And...Row!And row!And row!Battering ram
on the starboard side!Messala!Messala, a notice has come
from the Ionian Sea.The Astroea was lost in battle.Greek rebels ambushed our ships.Any survivors?The entire third fleet is lost.All are dead to the last man.Caesar demands that we retaliate.How long were you
a galley slave?One never knows.Dangerous territory.
Pirates and marauders.And which are you?The one not in chains.You wash ashore shackled,
your back striped.You were a galley slave. How long?Five years.What were you accused of?- I committed no crime.
- And I lay no blame.I asked what you were accused of.Sedition.That's a serious charge.I'll have to turn you over to the Romans.No. No.You are an escaped prisoner.To do otherwise would put
my camp in jeopardy.They'll kill me.I'm sure they will.We will discharge him
outside the garrisonbefore we leave for Jerusalem.Jerusalem.That's where I'm from.I have family there.Your private affairs
are no concern of mine.You race chariots?Young men race chariots.Old men wager on young men
who race chariots.How will you race
with only three horses?Aliyah is sick, but that's my dilemma.No. She's dying.I can help her.I know horses.I've seen it before. It's called farcy.It can be treated with charcoal.I can help her.All I ask in return,take me with you.Let me find my family.Or at least let me find out
what happened to them.What is your name?Judah.Judah Ben-Hur.The bargain is this, Judah Ben-Hur.You owe me your life.I expect that bill to be paid.Release him.Kill the leper!Look at yourself!Kill the leper!Don't! Please don't!- This man is your neighbor.
- Wait!- The Torah tells us to...
- Wait! Stop!...love your neighbor
as we love ourselves.Wait. Stop! Stop!Stop. Stop.Hate, anger, fear.Those are lies they
use to turn you against each other.When you set aside the hate
they force you to carry,that's when you knowlove is our true nature.Do you see what's
happening here?Mark my words, Messala,
this is the poison.But that man offers
the people something more,and calms them with compassion.This Jesus of Nazarethis more dangerous
than all of the Zealots combined.Wake up. Come on.Up we go, come on. Up. Up.Up we go. Good girl.Up we go. Come on. Come on.Ilderim.Good girl. Good girl.Good girl. Here we are.Here we are.Good girl.She looks well.No, not yet.She is taking the charcoal, though.Very nice.Aliyah.I had one just like her.- Did you now?
- Yes.So you do know something about horses.Thank you,Judah Ben-Hur.They're harnessed wrong.
Aliyah should be here.Kadeem?Mind your business.Listen to me.
If you take them into a gallop...Judah....they're going to bolt.The horses! Get the horses!Stop those horses!- Stay away! Stay away!
- Hold it! Hold it!Ilderim, be careful.Ilderim, move out of the way!Whoa, now! Whoa!Get out of the way!Kadeem!Aliyah!Stop! Stop! Stop her!- Kadeem!
- Hold it! Hold it!- Aliyah!
- Judah, no!Aliyah... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!No, Judah!Hang on!Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aliyah.Here, take the reins.Is she hurt?Oh. Oh, Aliyah. Shh.It's all right.- You're fine.
- Easy, girl. Easy.- Easy, girl. Shh.
- How did you know?I told him Aliyah should be on the inside.She hasn't run in a while.
She couldn't keep the pace.When she broke stride,
she incited the others.Kadeem.How's he?Not good.How is it you weren't put
directly to the sword?I was born to station.A rich Jew sentenced to a slow death.I imagine there were many in Rome who
found that very entertaining.Was there ever a kind
more obsessed with the obscene?People starve, the masses are enslaved,and Caesar answers with
less bread and more circuses.But I can't complain.Their excessive nature lines my purses.Is that why you're going to Jerusalem?There'll be opportunities to race.The Prefect is celebrating
himself with a tremendous circusand his champion, Messala.Messala Severus?- I hope this keeps you warm.
- Thank you.My love to your family.- Thank you.
- God bless you.Esther.Good to see you, Simon. God bless you.Esther, what is it?My husband.Oh, I've missed you.I've missed you so much.Oh, Judah.Judah. Judah.Judah.I shouldn't have run.They would have killed you, too.I would have died with my family.That's better than
being alone with my guilt.I've filled my life in other ways.By serving others?I've found people to care for.
People who care for me.When I can, I spread the Word.The message of Jesus.That carpenter, he showed you kindnesswhen no one else would.I've seen him do acts of grace so small,but so much more than other people do.Every day for five years
I asked myself the same questions.What happened to you?What happened
to my mother and sister?Were they crucified?Where are they buried?I don't know.Someone must know.Messala.He's become the pride of Roman Judea.He's the commander of the garrison,races chariots in Caesar's name.You couldn't go near him.You won't go near him.Get up.You can't stay in Jerusalem.
This isn't the place...No, no, no, I'm safe. I'm staying
in a cabin outside the garden gate.I will find
a way for us if that's what you still want.Wait to hear from me.Judah?So, charlatans,
religious indoctrinators,holy men.We will work with local people.We will make arrests.Anyone who doesn't get the message,we'll find an answer for.What's this?A gift brought by a messenger
with an invitation to meet.- Meet where?
- He said you would know.Have no fear of the Zealots.They fight, they disrupt.I haven't changed that much,
have I, brother?What do you want?Where is my mother and sister?They're dead.It was a quick death?Where are they buried?You forced my hand, Judah.You chose the Zealots over me.Listen, Judah, your pride...Onwards! Quickly!Surround this house!Walk through the portal!Coward.Catch him! Do not let him escape!Esther.Faith brought you back to me.The same faith that kept you alive.That wasn't faith.Faith wasn't strong enough.That was hate.I became hate.That's what kept me alive.Let Messala go.Don't you see
we've been given a second chance?Spend it on hatred,
then you're still a slave.What else do I have?Me.You have me.Messala was down
when we entered.There was at least one man.
He escaped over this balcony.Were they Zealots?I don't know, Prefect.And at the house of Hur.You were in uniform.An attack on you is an attack on Rome.An example needs to be made.What's the value of a Jew to a Roman?Ten to one.Twenty, I would say.Pull twenty Jews from the streets.Execute them
in the name of the Emperor.And let the people know, Messala,the days of forgiveness are behind them.Five, six, seven, eight, nine,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...What are doing?
We've done nothing!- Marcus!
- ...17, 18, 19.I have two!We have 19! Take one, leave the other!Judah!Have you been to the hillside?Have you seen the twenty
they've crucified?What twenty?There's talk. A Roman
attacked at the house of Hur.You did that.If people are dead, that's on Rome.You tried to kill Messala.I told you to stay away from him, Judah.
I warned you!I won't let him
go unpunished for what he's done to us.I can't.I watched my father be killed.I know what it's like to
want to take your feelings out on others.They deserve justice
for what's happened to them.There's nothing here for you anymore.Nothing.Know the world you live in, Judah.The world you live in is Rome's.Their laws.Their power.You cannot fight them in the streets.But there is another way.The circus.In the circus,there is no law.There is no right,no wrong.What happens there is sport,not vengeance.Do as you please.Give them a show,
the people will cheer you.How pathetic it must be
when your sole motivator is greed.You feed my beauties.Don't think you know me.Five years in the gut of a slave ship.I know what motivates.Five years of pain
after twenty of privilege,and now you think you know
something about suffering.Your situation is not unique, Judah.Neither are you.My son spoke up for liberation.He was branded a rebel.Dragged through the streets,
his throat slit like a hog.I traveled my
""all Romans must die"" phase,same as you.All Romans won't die.They can't die.You can't kill them quickly enough.If Messala is the pride of Rome,take their pride.Beat him in their circus.Give them a shame they will understand.I was accused.I'm meant to be dead.They won't let me race.They're Romans, Judah.For the right price,
they'll let you do anything.I bring greetings
and congratulationson the opening of your games, Prefect.This is a private gathering,
old man. Move on.I'm not here to cause trouble.Same as you, I'm here
for the love of sport.So, where do I have to go to make a bet?What's the wager?My chariot.The entries are long closed.Three thousand gold pieces.That enough to make you reconsider?If that's not enough, how about this?I'll give 3-to-1 odds on all bets.My book is open.That's very generous
against a strong field.I'm not betting the field.I'm betting that my driver
will be victorious overMessala.A bet like that's not customary.And it's not appropriate.Not appropriate for who?All of those citizens who stand to
gain when you beat my man?You will beat him, won't you?He's just a Jew.Oh, I'm sorry. I failed to mention that.But you've crushed an entire people.I should think
crushing one man wouldn't be difficult.You're on soft ground.My moneyagainst your pride.Seems even.3-to-1 not enough? How about 6-to-1?With the agreementthat should my driver cross the line first,any and all claims against him are quit.Any, and all.Good.I will leave this with youuntil the race is settled.African! What's the name of the driver?You know his name.Judah!Shorten those reins!Go, go, go!Go!Step forward!Good. Steady.Okay.Okay.Good. It will get better.I couldn't see anything.In the circus,be aware of the drivers' tricks.Two riders part,
suck you in between them,and crush you under their wheels.It's called the ""gate.""I just need to get to Messala.Well, you think they're just
gonna give it to you?No. The circus is a blood sport,but it is sport.There is strategy,
and you have to know it.Good?Esther.Esther, I need to ask something of you.There's nothing to speak of.I'm going to race Messala in the circus.It's the only way to end this.Please.You always cared deeply for my family.If you ever find their graves,bury us together, put us all to rest.Judah, you can't give up hope.You must believe there's a better way.There's not.Messala rides like the devil.He will do whatever he must to win.Now, when you cut first,
they'll tend to put you up on one wheel.So, you have to learn how to tilt.It's all about balance, Judah.It's a dangerous maneuver, of course,but with courage and practice,
it can be mastered.This is the spina.This is where I'll be.And I will try to guide you.Now, when the race begins,
do not try to take the lead.Lay back.
Let the other drivers fight for position.- And the best strategy...
- But if I'm in the back,how do I get to him?The race will bring him to you.With each successive lap,there will be fewer and fewer chariots.Which is why it's important
for you to stay back.And remember, Judah, first to finish,last to die.Messala.She wants you.Messala! Messala!Calm down.Messala! Messala! Messala!Messala! Messala!You can't race him.There's no stopping it.I'm asking you to remember
that Judah is your brother.The Hurs are your family.My past is lost to me.Each one of us has a choice.You and Judah can make things right.How?Disqualify him,or, disqualify yourself.And be branded as a coward?
I'll die first.Yes, one of you will die.There is no victory in this.Oh, so, you've come
to ask for my public humiliation.No, Messala.I've come to tell you
of the hell you'll unleash.God punishes just as God forgives.We have different gods.Marcus!She's asking for too much.Judah.Get up.You recognize him?No.Then he's a thief.Take him, and give him a thief's reward.No, Judah Ben-Hur.You don't remember.I remember you.You never forget a man
who's held a knife to your throat.I'll kill him!I'll kill him! I swear!Drusus. What's happened to you?I know where your family is.- My family are dead.
- No, they're not.He's lying.Rome doesn't keep prisoners,
it executes them.Pilate ordered your family to be crucified,but I had them intercepted.Sent to the caves at Timnath-Serah.Please, pay me,and I can take you to your family.I have to go with him.Ilderim, you must allow me this.I beg you. If there's even
a chance they're alive...They are.Let him up.Prepare a horse for him.I'll be back, I swear.- Take this.
- What for?He's a Roman.
That's all the reason you need.Why would you save them?I did it for Messala.
He cherished your sister.If he wouldn't save her himself,then I would save him
from his own mistake.Judah, please, wait.Mother?Oh, my God, you're alive.Mother, it's me. It's Judah.It's Judah.Judah?It's Judah.It's your son.I miss my boy.- Mother, I'm here.
- No.He's outside playing in the sun.No, I'm Judah. I'm Judah.You can't help us.Tirzah, what's happened?If you love us, forget about us.What's happened?- You are not my boy!
- Mother, what's wrong?We're lepers. Get out.- We're unclean, Judah!
- We're lepers!- Get him out now!
- We're lepers!- Get him out! Get him out!
- Judah, get out!- Go away!
- Get him out!You go away!Gesius, they are dying. Let us take them.- They have leprosy.
- Judah, please.I did what I could. It's better this way...I'll be back for them.They're lepers,
they'd be stoned in the street!I will be back for you!Judah, I tried.
I saved them. I saved them!You didn't save them!You condemned them
to a life worse than death.A life worse than death!He'll pay for what he's done to us.People of Jerusalem.Friends of Rome!We celebrate the power of man!You idiot!Get it now!Men gathered here todayhailing from Persia,Greece,Arabia,Syria......Ethiopia,Egypt,Judea.And the unbeatenRome!Going to run this.

the bet's simple.Half a C-note.
Most hot dogs in an hour wins.With toppings.- What the hell you weigh?

- Hey, Lip.Some guy called over here.
A doctor.He's looking for a driver.- You interested?
- Yeah.They're interviewing guys
tomorrow afternoon.The address is, uh,
881 7th Avenue.2:15.Hey. Excuse me.We're not open right now,
but you're welcometo purchase tickets
to tonight's performance.Nah, that's all right.I, uh... I think
I got the wrong address,but, uh, is there
a doctor's office in here?A doctor's office?Dr. Shirley?You have the correct address.Dr. Shirley lives upstairs,
above the Hall.How you doing?I'm here for the driver job.Tony Lip.No Tony Lip.No, I should be on there.Uh...no, um, I have a Tony Val...
Valle-la-la...Vallelonga. Yeah.That's me.Fill it out while you wait.What?Fill it out while you wait.Oh. Yeah.Have a seat.Mr. Vallelonga.
Sorry to keep you waiting.Oh.I'm Dr. Donald Shirley.Tony.Yes. Please sit down.Some place you got here.Are them horns real?Elephant tusks, yes.What about that?Is that a molar?A what?A molar, a-a shark tooth.Or a tiger's, maybe.It was a gift.I thought, uh... I thought
I was going to an office.They said a doctor
needed a driver.That's all they told you?Yeah.Actually, it's a bit more
complicated than that.Have you ever driven
professionally before?Yeah. Sanitation.Garbage trucks.Plus, I drive my boss home
at night.But I can drive anything.Limos. Tow trucks.Snowplows. Whatever.I see.What other experience
do you have?I worked a lot of joints.Wagon Wheel,
Peppermint Lounge, Copa.In what capacity?What do you mean?What did you do there?Uh...Public relations.Well, first of all, Tony,
I'm not a medical doctor.I'm a musician.You mean, like, songs?Yes.And I'm about to embark
on a concert tour,the majority of which
will be down south.Atlantic City.No.The Deep South.First, we're starting
in the Midwest,and then we're taking
a hard left.Kentucky, North Carolina,
Tennessee,and on down through the Delta.Do you foresee any issues
in working for a black man?No.No, no, no.It was just the other day,
me and the wifehad a couple of colored guys
over at the house.For-for drinks.Hmm. I see.You're married.Yeah. Two kids.I'm not sure this is the
proper job for a married man.Why? Are we bringing broads?My point is we'll be gone
for eight straight weeks.No breaks,
right up until Christmas.You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?Depends what you're paying.A hundred dollars a week,
plus room and board.Hmm.But let me be crystal clear.I'm not just hiring
a chauffeur.I need someone
who can handle my itinerary.Be a personal assistant.
I need a valet.I need someone who can launder
my clothes and shine my shoes.Good luck, Doc.Tony.I had my record label
ask around townto find me the right man.Your name came up
more than once.You've impressed several people
with your...innate ability
to handle trouble.And that is why I called
and inquiredabout your availability.Okay, here's the deal.I got no problem
being on the road with you.But I ain't no butler.I ain't ironing no shirts,and I'm not polishing
nobody's shoes.You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?You need someone to make surethere's no problems
along the way?And believe me,
you and the Deep South,there's gonna be problems.So, if you want me,it's a buck and a quarter
a week.Or go hire that little Chink
just pranced out of here.See how far you get.Well, Mr. Vallelonga,thank you for stopping by.Hey, Bobby.Give me a Rheingold.Ice cold.Mr. Tony.Augie asking about you.Come on!
I'm dying of thirst over here.Shut up!I'm talking.When?Now. He in his box.Tony Lip.What the hell happened
at the Copa?I hear you almost split
a guy's face open.That guy you hit,
Mikey Cerrone,part of
Charlie the Hand's crew.Guess he should have
known better.Hand asked me to look into it.I spoke to Podell.Whole thing was, uh,
over a piece of ass, right?Yeah.Beef like that should never
happen inside the club.They were out of line.So we squashed it.You, uh, looking to earn
a little extra <i>scharole?</i>I can keep you busy
while the Copa is down.What do I gotta do?Things.Appreciate it, but, uh,I want to spend some time
with the family.Don't be stupid.You make yourself a few extra
bucks, you buy something nicefor that pretty little wife
of yours.Hmm.Nah, I'm good.I'm flush right now.âª So long, Lover's Island- âª Dee
- âª Dee-oohâª Ee, ah, ooh, ay...Here's 50.Here. Pay me 60 by New Year's,
you get it back.Hey, Lip.Everything okay?What, you got
beak trouble, Charlie?Mind your business.âª Lover's Island...So, come on.
I'm dying to hear.What happened
with the doctor interview?He ain't a real doctor.He's a piano player.Well, I don't understand.Why did they say
that he was a doctor?I don't know.
I think he's, like,a doctor of, uh,
piano playing or something.You can be that?I guess.He lives on top
of Carnegie Hall.You should've seen
this place, Dee.It was filled with statues
and all kinds of fancy crap.And he was sitting on top
of a friggin' throneall dressed up like, uh, like
the king of the jungle bunnies.He's colored?Well, you wouldn't last
a week with him.For the right money, I would.Yeah.Oh.Look...Really?- Uh, okay.
- You okay?Okay, hang on a sec.It's, uh, Dr. Shirley,
the piano guy.He wants to talk to you.- Me?
- Yeah.What? No.Come on.- Take it.
- No. Tony...Just... just talk.Hello?Uh, good morning, Doctor.It's nice to talk to you.Well, uh, yes,
that is a long time.It is.Yes. I'm sure.Thank you.Thank you for calling.Bye, now.What'd he say?He wanted to know
if I'd be okaywith him taking my husband away
from his family for two months.He said he'd pay you
what you asked for.- Hey.
- Hmm?It's good money.We need it.Can't be eating 26 hot dogs
every day.I know.I told him it was okay
for you to go.All right, hey, look, so here's
the first half of your pay.You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.No, I gotta get paid
every week.Sorry. That's not how
the record company does it.We got to have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.Why wouldn't I finish the job?
I took it, didn't I?Well, then we got nothing
to worry about.Here's the deal,
Mr. Vallelonga.Okay, it's your job to get Don
to all his tour dates on time.Now, if he misses any shows,you're not getting
your back end.- He's not gonna miss any show.
- Good.Oh, you're gonna need this.Now, this is the book
I was telling you about.Now, sometimes you guys
are staying in the same hotel,sometimes you're not.- Oh, yeah, the...
- Yeah, yeah.All right, don't let me down.
Let's go.<i>Madonne,</i> is this the new one?Yeah, the record company
rented it.- It's nice, huh?
- Beautiful.So, what'd my sister
have to sayabout you being gone
for three weeks?Eight weeks.Ten to one,
you slap this moolie out,you come home in under a month.- Come here.
- All right, boys, huddle up.- Say good-bye to your father.
- Frankie, Nicky. Come here.All right.- You gonna be good boys?
- Uh-huh.- You'll listen to your mother?
- Mm-hmm.Yeah? All right, give me a kiss.I'm counting on youse.- Don't go too far.
- We won't.- Did you go to the AAA for the maps?
- Yes.No. I mean, the record
companies gave me the mapsand the itinerary,
and this thing.<i>The Negro Motorist's
Green Book.</i>Yeah, it lists all the places
coloreds can stay down south.Like a... you know,
traveling while black.- ""Traveling while black""?
- Yeah, if you're blackand you gotta travel,
for some reason.- Got a special book for that?
- I guess.- Did you pack the iron?
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.- Come on.
- How are you gonna press your pants, Tony?I'll put 'em
under the mattress.I want you
to write me a letter.- Every chance you get.
- I can't write letters.Yes, you can.- I can't write.
- Take you five minutes.- Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.It ain't gonna be no good.It's a lot cheaper than
calling long-distance, Tony.Promise me you're gonna write.I promise.Dee, put this in a bank today.It's half my pay.Oh. Here.
There's a couple of sandwichesfor you and Dr. Shirley.Thanks.Be careful.- I will.
- I love you.I love you, too, baby.You better be home
for Christmas,or don't come home at all.I got it, Pop. I got it.âª I got a letter from my babyâª Mailman brought it todayâª She said she's so sorryâª Uh, that she went awayâª She said,
""Daddy, don't worry âªâª ""Because it won't be longâª Hey, before
I'll be back home"" âªâª Oh, yeah...Hey.I'm Tony.His driver.Bum a smoke?Thanks.So, you're the band?Oleg. Cello.George. Bass.And we're not a band.

when we arrive in the city...- Hmm?
- ...is check the piano where I'm playing.Make sure it's a Steinway
as per my contract.âª Good-bye, my lover...And can you see to it that
there's a bottle of Cutty Sarkin my room every night?Every night?Well, if you ever need
any help with that...I won't.Ten and two
on the wheel, please.âª My lover...Hey, Doc.I noticed
on the itinerary thing,the last show's
on the 23rd of December, right?Birmingham, yes.
It's a Christmas show.So, any way we could, uh, maybe
hit the road early next morningso we'd be home in time
for Christmas Eve?We'll see.Appreciate it.Could you
put out the cigarette, please?Why?I can't breathe back here.What are you talking about?Smoke's going in my lungs;
I'm doing all the work here.Thank you.âª Can plainly seeâª And I knowâª I'm the oneâª You really love...âª Your ruby lipsâª Your lovely eyesâª Made my life romanticâª When you took
advantage of me... âªâª Now I seeWhat are you looking at?âª That you're
the only one for me... âªYou speak German, huh?That was Russian.Yeah, I was stationed
in Germany in the Army.I could pick up a little bit
of what you were saying there.Watch out for them krauts.They're all sneaks.Kennedy should've bombed them
when he had the chance.Plus, now them Cuban bastards.Ain't they supposed
to be following us?They have the itinerary.As long as they get
to the show on time,I'm not worried about it,
and neither should you.I ain't worried about nothing.In fact, when you
see me worried, you'll know.- Tony...
- You'll know if I'm worried.How about some quiet time?- Hmm?
- Sure.âª Your ruby lips...It's amazing you said that.""How about some quiet time?""Dolores, my wife,
used to say that all the time.Well, not all the time,
but you know.She says it when... when I
come home from work sometimes.You know, she's been
with the kids all day,and she'll say, ""Tony,
how about some quiet time?""Exactly like how you said it.I mean, it's amazing.How is that?Salty.Have you ever considered
becoming a food critic?No. Not really.Why? Is there money in that?I'm just saying you have
a marvelous way with wordswhen describing food.""Salty.""So vivid,
one can almost taste it.Hey, I'm just saying
it's salty.And salt's cheating.Any cook can make things salty.To make it taste good
without the salt,with just the other flavors,
that's the trick.I mean, you take
the basic ingredients...We should really get going soon
if we expectto get to Pittsburgh by dinner.Hmm. Hey,
when I was in the Army,I knew a guy from Pittsburgh.Except he called it
""Titsburgh.""'Cause he said all
the women there had huge tits.That's absurd.Why would women in Pittsburgh
have larger breaststhan, say, women in New York?Guess we'll find out, huh?Hey, you know,
when you first hired me,my wife went out
and bought one of your records.The one about the orphans.Orphans?Yeah.Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire.Orpheus.Yeah.<i>Orpheus in the Underworld.</i>It's based on a French opera.And those weren't children
on the cover.Those were demons
in the bowels of hell.No shit.Must have been naughty kids.What are...
what are you doing?Gotta take a leak, Doc.Here? Now?You want me to piss my pants?âª Whatcha gonna do?- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Good afternoon.Take this for any incidentals
we may need.If you want to buy something,
you don't have to ask.Just keep the receipts, please.When it runs low, let me know.Oh. Thanks.One more thing.We'll be attending many events
before and after the concerts.Interacting
with some of the wealthiestand most highly educated people
in the country.It is my feeling
that your diction,however charming it may be
in the tristate area,could use some... finessing.You mean diction...
like in what way?Like in the only way
the word is ever used.- Okay.
- Your intonation, inflection,your choice of words.Hey, I got my own problems.Now I gotta worry
about what people think- about the way I talk?
- There are simple techniquesI can teach you that are quite
effective. I can help you.I-I don't need no goddamn help.
People don't likethe way I talk,
they can go take a shit.The profanity is another issue.Why are you breaking my balls?Because you can do better,
Mr. Vallelonga.Which brings me
to one more point.As the guest of honor,
I'll be introducedwhen entering
these intimate events.You will be introduced as well.In my humble opinion,""Vallelonga"" may be difficult
to pronounce.So I was thinking...Valle would be more appropriate.Tony Valle. Short and sweet.Eh...nah.They got a problem
with Vallelonga,they can call me Tony Lip.These are genteel people.""Tony the Lip"" may be
a little...worldly for them.Well, then it's
Tony Vallelonga.All these high-class people,
so much smarter than me,with their intelligence
and speaking abilities,you're telling me
they can't pronounce my name?They don't like it,
they can shove it up their ass.I'll just wait outside.A sound compromise.Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are privilegedto present
a great American artist.He gave his first
public performanceat the age of three.At age 18,at Arthur Fiedler's invitation,our guest made
his concert debutwith the Boston Pops.He holds doctorates
in psychology, in musicand in the liturgical arts.And he has performed
at the White House twicein the past 14 months.He is a true virtuoso.- And it's a...
- ""Virtuoso.""- It's a special treat for me...
- That's Italian.Means, uh, means really good.So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcomethe Don Shirley Trio.A new pair of shoes!- Hard ten! Lady's friend.
- He keeps on winning!It's your dice.
I'm just having a lucky night.You cheating, brother!- Tony.
- Get him again. Get him again.- Boss man's calling.
- He ain't my boss.I work for the record company.Yeah, I work
for the record company, too.Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on, man.Hey, give us a chance
to win back our loot, huh?I'm sorry, fellas, duty calls.- Come on, man.
- ""Duty calls""?My man, my duty is
to get my money back.I've been looking for you.Yeah, sorry. The guys
were having a little game.Next time you need
extra money, just ask me.It's more fun winning it.And what if you lost?Grab some cards.
I don't lose, Doc.I don't lose.So stooping down in the gravelpitching dice for pocket change
makes you a winner?What are you
giving me shit for?Everybody was doing it.They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.You did.Now, wipe off your knees.
You have dirt on them.<i>Dear Dolores: How are you?</i><i>I am fine.</i>""I'm eating real good.
Hamburgers, mostly.""So don't worry about me
not eating good.""I saw Dr. Shirley
play the piano tonight.""He don't play
like a colored guy.""He plays like Liberace,
but better.""He's like a genius, I think.""When I look at him
in the rearview mirror,""I can tell he's
always thinking about stuff""in his head.""I guess that's
what geniuses do.""But it don't look fun
to be that smart.I miss you very, very much.""Who is this?Who?On the radio.Little Richard.Really?
That's Little Richard?Yeah.Think you could play
something like that, Doc?âª Lucille...I don't know.
Sounds fairly complicated.Got that right.So, where did this ""Tony
the Lip"" moniker come from?It's not Tony the Lip.It's Tony Lip. One word.I got it when I was kid,
'cause my friend saidI was the best bullshit artist
in the Bronx.Why are you smiling?What do you mean?It doesn't bother you
that your friends,the people closest to you,
consider you a liar?Who said ""liar""?I said ""bullshit artist.""And what's the difference?'Cause I don't lie. Ever.I'm just good
at talking people into...you know, doing things
they don't want to do.By bullshitting them.And you're proud of that?Well, it got me this job.âª Lucille, please don't...âª Baby, baby,
baby, baby, take it easy... âªWait a minute.
You're full of shit.You never heard
of Chubby Checker?Of course I've heard of him.- I've just never heard his music before.
- I mean...But I like this.
This is nice.He's got a silky voice,
very smooth.Yeah, he's terrific.This is what everybody's
dancing to now.- This stuff...
- Eyes on the road, Tony.âª Baby, here I am...You know this song.I don't think so, no.How could you
not know this music?Aretha Franklin.Chubby Checker,
Little Richard, Sam Cooke.I mean, come on, Doc.
These are your people.âª And it won't be longâª No, it won't be long...Do you want anything?
I'm getting a pack of smokes.No, thank you.Grabbed the rock
and put it in his pocket.Thank you, Oleg.Nice turtleneck.Way to mix it up.Got you an apple, Doc.Before we pull out, Tony,
we need to have a talk.Yeah?Oleg told me what you did.What'd I do?You stole a jade stone
from the store.- No, I didn't.
- He watched you do it.I didn't steal no stone.You picked it up
and put it in your pocket.I picked up a rock
off of the ground.I didn't steal from a box.Now, why would you pick up
a rock off the ground?I don't know.'Cause it ain't stealing.It's just a regular rock.And why would you want
a regular rock?To have.For luck, maybe.A lucky rock.- Yeah.
- Let me see it.Mm-mm.Take it back and pay for it.I told you that kraut
was a snake.Rats me out for something
I didn't even do!Pay for the stone, Tony;
you'll feel better.I feel fine. And I ain't paying
for no regular rockI found in the dirt.Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.Put it back.- Feel better?
- No.If you'd like, Tony,
I'd happily buy you the stone.Don't bother.
You took all the fun out of it.Excuse me. Sir.I'm with the band.You're all set up.This isn't the piano, right?That's it.It ain't a Steinway.So what?Dr. Shirley only plays
on Steinway grand pianos.It's in his written contract.Who's Dr. Shirley?Dr. Shirley.
The Don Shirley Trio.They're playing tonight.Does it really matter?Yeah, it does.
It's in his contract.Come on, man.
Man, these coonscan play on anything
you put in front of them.But it's a piece of shit.And there's garbage in there.So take it out.What'd you say?You heard me.Hey. You got two, three hours.Just get
a clean Steinway in here.Oh, there ain't a Steinway
on campus.Not my problem.I bet
there's not two Steinwaysin the whole state of Indiana.I guess you'd better move
your ass, then.Who you think you're
talking to, greaseball?<i>Dear Dolores:</i><i>This morning
I had steak and eggs</i><i>for breakfast.</i><i>The band has been playing
at very ritzy joints.</i><i>Dr. Shirley and I
are getting along pretty good.</i><i>But sometimes
I think he gets sad,</i><i>and that's why
he drinks too much.</i><i>I never knew how very beautiful
this country was.</i><i>Now that I'm seeing it, I know.</i><i>You won't believe
how beautiful nature is.</i><i>It is as beautiful as they say.</i><i>And the traffic out here
in the country is nothing,</i><i>which is fine by me.</i><i>Right now I'm eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner</i><i>that tastes like ketchup
on Chinese noodles.</i><i>We are heading down south now.</i><i>I will write you another letter
when we get down south.</i><i>I love you. Your husband, Tony.</i><i>P.S. Kiss the kids for me.</i>Got any family, Doc?Not really.Not really?
Either you do or you don't.It's a long story, Tony.What, we're in a hurry now?Let's hear it.I have a brother somewhere.We used to get together
once in a while,but it got more and more
difficult to stay in touch.Curse of being
a musician, I guess.Always on the road.Like a carnival worker.- Hmm.
- Or a criminal.Took quite the toll
on my marriage as well.- You're married?
- Was.June.Good person.Terrible grammar,
but a kind soul.You'd quite like her.June.Like, uh, like Lassie's mom.Unfortunately,
I couldn't do a husband actand a concert pianist act.Couldn't seem to manage
both worlds.Kentucky Fried Chicken.In Kentucky!When's that ever gonna happen?All right!Hey, you want some?I'm fine. Thank you, Tony.All right.Mmm. I think this is
the best Kentucky Fried ChickenI ever had.Probably 'cause it's fresher
down here, right?I don't think I've ever met
anyone with your appetite.No. I got the bucket
so you could have some.I've never had fried chicken
in my life.Who you bullshitting?You people love
the fried chicken,the grits
and the collard greens.I love it, too.
Negro cooks used to make itall the time
when I was in the Army.You have a very narrow
assessment of me, Tony.Yeah, right? I'm good.No. No, you're not good.
You're bad.I'm saying, just because
other Negroes enjoycertain types of music,
it doesn't mean I have to.- Nor do we all eat the same kind of food.
- Whoa.Wait a minute.If you said
all guineas like pizzaand spaghetti and meatballs,
I'm not gonna get insulted.You're missing the point.For you to make the assumption
that every Negro...- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.Here. Come on.- Tell me that don't smell good.
- It...- Huh?
- It smells okay.I prefer not to get grease
on my blanket.Ooh, I'm gonna get
grease on my blankey.Come on, have a piece.
It ain't gonna kill you.- Come on, take it, eat it.
- No.Take it.
I'm throwing it in the back.- You... Don't you dare.
- Then you better take it.How? Do you have plates
or utensils?Eat it with your hands!- That's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.Eat it. Come on.
Take it, take it, take it.I gotta drive.
Ten and two on the wheel.- Come on. Take it, take it, take it.
- Tony...Come on, come on.There you go.Huh?I-I can't do this, Tony.Eat the goddamn thing!Jesus.- What, no good?
- Mm.It just seems...so un... unsanitary.Who gives a shit?Just relax and enjoy it.You know,
my father used to say...""Whatever you do,
do it a hundred percent.""When you work, work.
When you laugh, laugh.When you eat,
eat like it's your last meal.You want another piece?Here. Have a breast.Delicious.Take it. Here you go.What do we do about the bones?We do this.This is what we do.âª If you go to New Orleansâª You ought to go see
the Mardi Gras âªThere you go.âª You ought to go see
the Mardi Gras âªâª When you see
the Mardi Gras... âªWhat's the big deal, Doc?The squirrels
would've ate it anyway.Pick it up, Tony.Nature takes care
of the Earth.- Pick it up.
- Aw, geez.âª If you wanna go
through New Orleans... âªThis can't be right.It says right here,""Cozy as your own home.""Place looks like my ass.This is the place.The square one, please.- Just this one?
- Thank you.Hey, uh...if you need anything,I'll be right up the street
at the Easton Inn.Thank you, Tony.- Hey, Floyd, we ready.
- I told you,- I can't play. My shoulder.
- You and that damn shoulder.Hey!Hey, fancy-pants.You want to play?I beg your pardon?Come on, brother,
we short a man.Oh, I-I'd rather not.What, you too high and mighty?No, no,
let him alone, let him alone.He just afraid of getting that
butler uniform a little dusty.Mm.I'm just, um...I'm on my way to meet a friend.Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.Floyd, come on, man.Shut your ass up, man,
and leave me alone!Mm.Eh.""For vacation
without aggravation.""Hmm.""Delightful dinners
for particular people.""- Yeah?
- Get up. It's George.Get up.Tony, come on. Hurry up.Dr. Shirley's in trouble.I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,and Dr. Shirley's in there
getting bounced around.I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do.Who let him out of his cage?And they put that little tie
on him, too.- Why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.Get your hands off him.What in the good goddamn
we got here, fellas?Hand him over.We walk out.
Won't be a problem.I just wanted a drink, Tony.Hey, I told you we'll leave.- Not a big deal. Come on.
- He ain't going nowhere.We need a Brillo Pad
to wash these dishes with.Listen, assholes.Do yourselves a favor
and let him go.Now!Say it nice.I just said it nice.This boy is gonna get
what he's got coming to him.And you, you ain't got no say.Maybe.But whatever happens here,
I'm gonna put a bulletright in the middle
of your thick skull.He ain't got no gun, Ray.He's full of shit.What if he ain't?Well, I sure ain't.And I ain't about to let this
come to pass in my place.Let the spook go.Let him go.Come on.Get him out of here.I want these Yankees
off of my property.- Go on.
- Go on, George. Go. Go.I got you, Doc.Go on.- You out of your mind?
- I'm sorry.I didn't mean to put you
in that position.Wait, wait, wait.Are you gonna throw up again?I'm okay.Honest to God, Doc,
I don't understand you.You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.I just needed some air.Air?Do you know where you are?Does geography really matter?What?If I was in a bar
in your neighborhood,would the conversation
be any different?From now on, you don't go
nowhere without me.Nowhere!- Got it?
- I-I understand.Where's your room?Tony.What?Do you really have a gun?Course not.Doc, where's your goddamn room?- Come on.
- There it is.Over there?You gotta get to bed, Doc.You got a big show
tomorrow night. Come on.Thank you.Louisville.Thank you for
your warm hospitality.Bravo!Thank you. Thank you.âª Why oh whyâª Has my baby...Don't be lazy, Tony. Enunciate.- I am.
- Betty bought a bit of better butter- to make the bitter butter better.
- Betty bought...B-Bought... Betty bought
butta-er, butta...Who says that? Butta-er.You have to start
somewhere, Tony.A singer does vocal exercises.An athlete warms up
before they rehearse.Athletes practice.
They don't rehearse.Ah, shit.Ladies and gentlemen,
a very special guestfrom the far north,Don Shirley.Accompanying Mr. Shirley,
the members of his trio,Oleg Malacovich, George Dyer,
and his associateTony Valle... Valle...
Vallelong-longia.Oh, this is my lovely wife,
Margaret.If you gentlemen don't mind,we're going to steal
Donnie awayfor some, uh, introductions.I'd like you all
to meet Don Shirley.- Yeah. I'll take one.
- Hmm.What's that?A pimento and cheese
sandwich, sir.Yeah, I'll try one of them.Oof.Sorry. Not for me.Earlier this week,
we asked our helpwhat Mr. Shirley
might like for supper.So the boys in the kitchen
whipped up a special menu- in honor of our guest.
- Oh!Gentlemen.Home-cooked fried chicken.There we go.Bring it in. Serve it up hot.Thank you. Thank you.We'll return after
a brief intermission.Excuse me, Don.- Lovely work in there.
- Why, thank you.Uh, are you looking
for the commode?- Yes. I...
- Yeah, here. Let me help you.It's right out there
before that pine.I'd prefer not to use that.Well, don't be silly, Don.It looks a lot worse
from the outside.And I suppose you'd know
from experience.Well, I've never had
any complaints.Well, I could return
to my moteland use the facilities there,but that would take
at least a half an hour.We don't mind waiting.<i>Why don't I just pull over?</i>You can piss in the woods.Animals go in the woods.It's gonna be
at least 20 minutes,I gotta go all the way back
to your motel.So let's just get thereso I can go back
and finish the show.See, that's the
difference between you and me.I'd have zero problem
going in the woods.I'm well aware.What are you sore at me for?I don't make the rules
down here.No?Then who does?Oh.You're saying just 'cause
I'm white and they're white?You know, that's a very
prejudiced thingyou just said there.A very prejudiced thing.I got more in common
with the Hymiesat 2nd Avenue Deli than I dowith these hillbilly pricks
down here.Eyes on the road.You always say thatwhen you don't like
what I'm saying.Eyes on the road.I don't get it.How does he smile and shake
their hands like that?They try to pull
that outhouse shit on me,I'd piss right
on the living room floor.Don't-don't do that.We have many
concert dates left.Yeah? So?You realize we're contractually
obliged to perform them?Course I do.You don't play,
we don't get paid.What's your point?Ugly circumstances
are going to happen again,so control yourself.Don't lecture me, you rat.Dr. Shirley could have
stayed up north,getting rear end kissed
at Park Avenue partiesfor three times money.But he ask for this.Why?What on God's green Earth
are you doing?A letter.Looks more like
a piecemeal ransom note.May I?""Dear Dolores.""D-E-A-R.This is an animal.""I'm meeting all
the highly leading citizens""of the town.""People that use big words,
all of them.""But you know me. I get by.I'm a good bullshitter.""Two T's in ""bullshitter.""""As I'm writing this letter,

""P.S. Kiss the kids""?A P.S.?Yeah, like, at the end.That's like clanging a cowbellat the end
of Shostakovich's Seventh.Right. And that's good?It's perfect, Tony.Everybody talks
about Willie Mays, 1954.It wasn't even the greatest
catch in the Polo Grounds.That was Joe DiMaggio, 1936,second game
of the World Series.Final out, 500 feet...You like that, Doc?That's a handsome suit.- Sharp.
- Mm-hmm.Guy looks just like you.He does?Well, size-wise. Yeah.It is about a 42.- Why don't you try it on?
- Hmm...What, you gotta wear
a tuxedo onstage every night?You could mix it up
a little, Doc.Come on, let's see
how it looks on you.We got plenty of time.I'll be right back.- How you doing?
- May I help you, sir?Yeah, we want
to try on that, uh,beautiful gray suit
in the window.You got it in a 42?Of course.That's the one.Dressing room
is in the back, sir.Thank you.- I'll be just a moment.
- Take your time, Doc.I'll check out
some ties for you.Uh, e-excuse me.Uh, you're not allowed
to try that on.I beg your pardon?Uh, if you'd like
to purchase it first,we'd be happy
to tailor it to your needs.I see.Yeah.That's me.Hey, Officer.I got a call about Dr. Shirley.Come on.His friend's here.Thank you.Get a guy a towel,
for Christ's sake.You a lawyer?- No.
- Well, you should call one.- We're taking your auntie in.
- For what?Manager caught him
and the other guy.Well, can we get
the cuffs off him,let him put his pants on,
we talk about this?Sure, we could.But we ain't.Okay, look, we're out of here
tomorrow morning.You'll never see us again.There's gotta be something
we can do to work this out.What if you let him goand I give you something
to thank you?- You bribing us?
- No.Hell no.A gift.A thank-you.What kind of thank-you?Like a...you know, donation
to the police force.Youse guys.Whatever you want.You like suits?I was walking through
your nice town today,and I seen a store
that was selling suits.Primo suits.What if, as a thank-you...
a donation...I buy youse each a suit?You get all dressed up,you take the wife out
for dinner.I mean, guys like you,
you work hard.You deserve it.They were wrong
for the way they treated me,and you rewarded them.I was hired to get you
from one show to the next.How I do it
shouldn't matter to you.I just wish you hadn't
paid 'em off.I did what I had to do.You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.Okay, Tony.I need you to stop it
with the phony altruismand concern for my career.What the hell does that mean?You were only thinking
about yourself back therebecause you know,
if I miss a show,it'll come out
of your pocketbook.Of course I don't want you
to miss a show,you ungrateful bastard.You think I'm doing this
for my health?Tonight, I saved your ass.So show a little
appreciation, maybe.Besides, I told you never
to go nowhere without me!I assumed you'd want this
to be the exception.Want me to get some makeup
or somethingfor the show tomorrow?No, I'm fine.You sure? Bruise kind of shows.I said I'm fine.Okay.He didn't ask me to do that.Dom, I'm telling you,
that's what he told me.He didn't ask me.Oh. Tony Lip.- Dominic, Mags.
- What the hell...?What the hell you guys
doing down here?Hey, Brooklyn sent us down.- Take care of a few things.
- Yeah.I'm working here.Sorry, Doc. They're some
friends from New York.Hey, can you get
Dr. Shirley's luggage?All right.Called his room.Be down in a minute.Hey, Doc.Where are you off to?Just going downstairs.To have a drink.Tony...I think you're doing
a wonderful job.So...I'd like to formally offer youthe position
of my road manager.With the title also comes
more responsibility, but...that also means a raise in pay.No. No.No, thanks.We agreed on 125 a week,
plus expenses.That's our deal, right?I ain't going nowhere, Doc.I-I was just going down
to tell them.Tony.I'm sorry about last night.Don't worry about it.I've been working nightclubs
in New York City my whole life.I know it's a...
complicated world.<i>So, where'd you learn</i>how to play like that?- My mother.
- Your mother?- Really?
- Mm-hmm.She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.Soon as I could walk, we'd...travel around
the Florida Panhandle,put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.Fortunately,
a man who had seen me playarranged for me to studyat the Leningrad Conservatory
of Music.I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.It's all I ever wanted to play.But I was persuaded
by my record companyto pursue a career
in popular music instead.They insisted that audiences
would never accepta Negro pianist
on a classical stage.Wanted to turn me into just
another colored entertainer.You know, the guy who's smoking
while he's playingand sets a glass of whiskey
on his piano,and then complains
because he's not respectedlike Arthur Rubinstein.You don't see Arthur Rubinsteinputting a glass of whiskey
on his piano.I don't know.
Personally, I think,if you stuck
to the classic stuff,it would've been a big mistake.A mistake?Performing the music I trained
my entire life to play?Trained?
What are you, a seal?People love what you do.Anyone could sound
like Beethoven or...""Joe Pan""
or them other guys you said,but your music, what you do......only you can do that.Thank you, Tony.But not everyone
can play Chopin.Not like I can.âª I love my baby...<i>""The trees have shed

you're driving him around.You're half a nigger yourself.Hands in the air!Now! Now!Excuse me.Excuse me, sirs.I-I understand why my associate
is being held,but what exactly am I
being charged with?You seem like reasonable men.Perhaps you could let me outso that we could discuss
the situation further.Just put the apple butter
away, boy.You ain't going nowhere
no time soon.You cannot hold me
without cause.Well, I got cause.'Cause you let the sun set
on your black ass.I want to speak to my lawyer.I want my call.This is a flagrant violation

that stage, I go right backto being just another nigger
to them.Because that is
their true culture.And I suffer that slight alone,because I'm not accepted
by my own people'cause I'm not like them,
either.So, if I'm not black enough
and if I'm not white enoughand if I'm not man enough,
then tell me, Tony, what am I?I need some sleep.All right.I'll stop at the next place
we seeand sneak you into my room.No. No.I refuse to stay
in an establishmentwhere I'm not welcome.Yeah. Okay.Tony, do you have
to smoke everywhere?I didn't know it bothered you.You should have told me.All you gotta do
is say the word, Doc.You do realize you'll be home
before that letter arrives.Yeah, I know.Just thought I'd bring it
with me.Save on stamps.All right.Tony, give it here.
I'll fix it.No offense, Doc,but I think
I got the hang of it now.""Dear Dolores:""Sometimes you remind me
of a house.""A house with
beautiful lights on it,where everyone
is happy inside.""Yes, Tony. You got it.Yeah?Thanks.Hey, Doc, thanks for helping me
with, uh, the letters.You're really good
at writing 'em.My pleasure, Tony.You know, um,
when you get home,maybe you should write...
write one to your brother.He knows where I am
if he ever wants to reconnect.Eh. I wouldn't wait.You know, world's full
of lonely peopleafraid to make the first move.Yeah, I'll finish this
tomorrow.You know, Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.Hmm?That Titsburgh
was a major disappointment.I didn't notice
any difference at all.Did you?Good night, Tony.- Good evening.

I'm the general manager.It is a pleasure to meet you.Thank you, Mr. Kindell.This is Mr. Tony Vallelonga.- Nice to meet you, Tony.

our Christmas showis our biggest show
of the year,and we are so happy
to have you here, Mr. Shirley.So, if you need anything,anything at all,
you let me know.- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Now, here we are.We got about an hour
before showtime. Any questions?Where's the restaurant?Well, you continue
down the hall here, Tony,to the right
and across the lobby.- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.Well, he said we got an hour.You must be starving, Doc.Go ahead. I'll meet you there.May we join you?Mm. Go ahead.Cocktail, gentlemen?I'm good.Three shots vodka.Oh.Last show. Cold War over.Time for truce.Is Dr. Shirley
in his dressing room?Yeah.
More like half a broom closet.Tell you, I don't know
how he puts up with that shit.Six years ago, in 1956,Nat King Cole
was invited to performat the Municipal Auditorium
here in Birmingham.Mr. Cole was the first Negro
asked to playat a white establishment
in this city.As soon as he started playing,
a group of menattack him for playing
white people's music.They pull him off stageand beat him badly.Jesus Christ.You asked me once
why Dr. Shirley does this.I tell you.Because genius is not enough.It takes courage
to change people's hearts.Thanks.Thank you.No?<i>Danke schÃ¶n.</i>- Good evening.
- Can I help you?Oh, um...Um, there.
Some friends of mine.Uh, y-you-you can't come
in here.- I understand, but...
- Hey. What's going on?This... gentleman says that I'm
not permitted to dine here.No, you don't understand.He's playing tonight.
He's the main event.- Come on.
- I-I'm sorry, but...it is the policy
of the restaurant.Everything all right?Uh, no, it's not all right.This guy's saying Dr. Shirley
can't eat here.Oh, well, I apologize,
but...these are long-standing
traditions, club rules.I'm sure you understand.No, I do not understand.In 45 minutes,
I will be right up thereon that stage
entertaining your guests,yet I can't eat here?I'm sorry.Wait a minute.
Are you telling methe bozos in his bandand all these people
who came here to see him play,they can eat here,
but the star of the show,the-the parking spot of honor,
he can't?I'm afraid not.Well, he's gotta eat.
I mean, he's gotta have dinner.Okay.
I'll tell you what.Why don't we bring something
to his dressing room, huh?John, show him a menu.No.I'm not eating
in that storage room.Okay, uh, well, if you prefer,there's a very popular
establishmentright down the road,
the Orange Bird,they'd be happy to feed you.Doc, come here.Just one second, one second.You know what, maybe that
other place is better anyway.I mean, the dinner rolls here
are like rocks.You just go over and...
you go over and come back.It's the last show.It's the bottom of the ninth.Let's just get it over with,and we can go home,
get away from these pricks.Huh?Ah, there you go.The fish is wonderful tonight.Either I eat in this room,or I'm not performing tonight.May I have a word with you?No.Mr. Villanueva,you have to talk sense
to Mr. Shirley.Please make him understand.We're not insulting him
personally.This is just the way
things are done down here.Yeah, well,
he's not from down here.Yeah, just-just ask him
to be reasonable.I got 400 guests in thereexpecting to be entertained
tonight.And Dr. Shirley expects
to eat tonight.Why can't you just make
an exception this one time?Let me tell you a story.You ever hear of the
Boston Celtics basketball club?- Yeah.
- Well...those boys came through herecouple years ago
on a barnstorming tour, and...seeing as they was
the world championsof the league and all, we were
tickled to have them here,and we rolled out
the welcome wagon.So, do you know what tabletheir big coon ate at
that night?No.I don't, either,
but it wasn't one of ours.Now, let's cut the bullshit.Tell me what it's
gonna take, huh?Say, uh, a hundred dollars,
you get your boy to play?You think you can buy me?With all due respect, sir,you wouldn't be in a job like
this if you couldn't be bought.Stop.Tony.It's all right.I'll play if you want me to.All right.Let's get the fuck out of here.What do you mean,
""Let's get out of here""?Where the hell
do you think you're going?Don, don't do this. Now, you
signed a contract, and I...I know you're the kind of man
who honors a contract.Connie, Bill, everything's

the next day</i><i>about 2,000 meters from Cambodia</i><i>into a battalion perimeter.</i><i>It felt like we were returning
to the scene of a crime.</i><i>Alpha Company had been hit hard
the day before by a sizable force,</i><i>and Charlie Company had been probed
that night.</i><i>There were other battalions in the valley.
We weren't the only ones.</i><i>But we knew we were gonna be the bait
to lure them out.</i><i>Somewhere out there
was the entire 141st NVA regiment.</i>Caught those motherfuckers
trying to pull some shiton Charlie Company last night.They found maps on them, man.Got a friend at battalion,says they had every fucking foxhole here
fixed on it.Distances, tree-lines, our claymores,
everything.This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.I also heard we're in fucking Cambodia
right now.Cambodia? Man, you kidding me.You wanted to see me, sir?Yeah, Ramucci.
Looks like you got Elias' squad now.Squad, sir?I didn't know we were still referring
to this platoon in terms of squads.All right, look.I want you to take those two holes
right there and there.You're tying it off with Barnes up here,
King down there.Yeah.Begging your pardon, sir.My two holes are far enough apart
you can run a regiment through themand never see them.I have five live bodies left, sir.Look, I don't wanna hear your problems,
Ramucci.You'll get new men any day.Meantime, you make do
like everybody else. Okay?- I didn't ask for this job.
- I don't want to hear it.- Oh, you don't wanna hear it?
- Yeah, that's right.I don't wanna hear it, 'cause to tell
the truth, I don't give a shit, okay?- I just don't give a flying fuck any more.
- Right.<i>(MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO)</i>I'm glad I ain't going with them.Somewhere out there is the beast

on that chopper with King out of here.What do you say, chief-a-rooney?I can't do that for you, Red.We need every swinging dick in the field,

You can talk to me, for Christ's sake.All I'm asking for is three fucking days,

- Sister Bernice.- I simply cannot find her.
- Maria?She's missing from the abbey again.Perhaps we should have put
a cowbell around her neck.Have you tried the barn?
You know how much she adores the animals.I have looked everywhere, in all of the usual places.Sister Bernice, considering that it's Maria...I suggest you look in someplace unusual.Well, Reverend Mother, I hope this new infraction...ends whatever doubts you may still have
about Maria's future here.I always try to keep faith in my doubts, Sister Berthe.After all, the wool of a black sheep is just as warm.We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.Of all the candidates for the novitiate...- I would say Maria is the least likely-
- Children, children!We were speculating about the qualifications
of some of our postulants.The mistress of novices
and the mistress of postulants...were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.Tell me, Sister Catherine, what do you think of Maria?She's a wonderful girl, some of the time.Sister Agatha?Itâs very easy to like Maria...except when it's difficult.And you, Sister Sophia?I love her very dearly, but she always
seems to be in trouble, doesn't she?Exactly what I say.âª She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee âªâª Îer dress has got a tear âªâª She waltzes on her way to mass âªâª And whistles on the stair âªâª Înd underneath her wimple âªâª She has curlers in her hair âªâª I've even heard her singing in the abbey âªâª She's always late for chapel âªâª But her penitence is real âªâª She's always late for everything âªâª Except for every meal âªâª I hate to have to say it âªâª But I very firmly feel âªâª Maria's not an asset to the abbey âªâª I'd like to say a word in her behalf âªThen say it, Sister Margaretta.âª Maria makes me laugh âªâª Îow do you solve a problem like Maria âªâª Îow do you catch a cloud and pin it down âªâª Îow do you find a word that means Maria âªâª Î flibbertigibbet âª- âª A will-o'-the-wisp âª
- âª A clown âªâª Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her âªâª Many a thing she ought to understand âªâª But how do you make her stay âªâª And listen to all you say âªâª Îow do you keep a wave upon the sand âªâª Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria âªâª Îow do you hold a moonbeam âªâª In your hand âªâª When I'm with her, I'm confused âªâª Out of focus and bemused âªâª And I never know exactly where I am âªâª Unpredictable as weather âªâª She's as flighty as a feather âª- âª She's a darling âª
- âª She's a demon âªâª She's a lamb âªâª She'd out-pester any pest âªâª Drive a hornet from its nest âªâª She can throw a whirling dervish out of whirl âªâª She is gentle, she is wild âªâª She's a riddle, she's a child âª- âª She's a headache âª
- âª She's an angel âªâª She's a girl âªâª Îow do you solve a problem like Maria âªâª Îow do you catch a cloud and pin it down âªâª Îow do you find a word that means Maria âªâª A flibbertigibbet âª- âª A will-o'-the-wisp âª

- Oh!Oh, Reverend Mother, I'm so sorry.I just couldn't help myself.The gates were open,
and the hills were beckoning, and before I-Dear, I haven't summoned you here for apologies.Oh, please, Mother, do let me ask for forgiveness.If it would make you feel better.Yes. Well, you see, the sky was so blue today...and everything was so green and fragrant.I just had to be a part of it.And the Untersberg
kept leading me higher and higher...as though it wanted me
to go right through the clouds with it.Child, suppose darkness had come and you were lost?Oh, Mother, I could never be lost up there.That's my mountain. I was brought up on it.It was the mountain that led me to you.Oh?When I was a child,
I would come down the mountain...and climb a tree and look over into your garden.I'd see the sisters at work,
and I'd hear them sing on their way to vespers...which brings me to another transgression,
Reverend Mother.I was singing out there today without permission.Maria, it is only here in the abbey
that we have rules about postulants singing.I can't seem to stop singing wherever I am.And what's worse, I can't seem to stop saying things-everything and anything I think and feel.Some people would call that honesty.But it's terrible, Reverend Mother.You know how Sister Berthe always makes me
kiss the floor after we've had a disagreement?Lately I've taken to kissing the floor
when I see her coming just to save time.Maria, when you saw us over the abbey wall...and longed to be one of us...that didn't necessarily mean...that you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?No, Mother, but I- I pray, and I try...and I am learning, I really am.What is the most important lesson
you have learned here, my child?To find out what is the will of God
and to do it wholeheartedly.Maria.It seems to be the will of God that you leave us.- Leave?
- Only for a while, Maria.Oh, no, Mother, please don't do that.
Don't send me away.This is where I belong. Itâs my home, my family.Itâs my life.- But are you truly ready for it?
- Yes, I am.Perhaps if you go out into the world for a time...knowing what we expect of you...you will have a chance to find out
if you can expect it of yourself.I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it.- I promise I can.
- Maria.Yes, Mother.If it is God's will.There is a family near Salzburg...that needs a governess until September.- Until September?
- To take care of seven children.- Seven children!
- Do you like children, Maria?Well, yes, but seven!I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.Uh, Captain?A retired officer of the Imperial Navy.A fine man and a brave one.Îis wife died several years ago,
leaving him alone with the children.I understand he's had a most difficult time...managing to keep a governess there.Uh, why difficult, Reverend Mother?The Lord will show you in his own good time.[ Female Choir ]

- What?Turn.Îat off.[ Sighs ]
Itâs the dress.You'll have to put on another one
before you meet the children.But I don't have another one.When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes were given to the poor.What about this one?- The poor didn't want this one.
- Hmm.I would have made myself a new dress,
but there wasn't time.I can make my own clothes.Well, I'll see that you get some material.Today, if possible.- Now, FraÃ¼lein, um-
- Maria.FraÃ¼lein Maria, I don't know how much
the mother abbess has told you.- Not much.
- You are the 12th in a long line of governesses...who have come to look after my children
since their mother died.I trust that you will be an improvement
on the last one. She stayed only two hours.What's wrong with the children, sir?There's nothing wrong with the children,
only the governesses.Oh.They were completely unable to maintain discipline.Without it, this house cannot be properly run.- You will please remember that, fraÃ¼lein?
- Yes, sir.Every morning you will drill
the children in their studies.I will not permit them to dream away
their summer holidays.Each afternoon they will march about
the grounds, breathing deeply.Bedtime is to be strictly observed, no exceptions.Excuse me, sir. When do they play?You will see to it that they
conduct themselves at all time...with the utmost orderliness and decorum.- I'm placing you in command.

and I will not have anyone shouting.You will take this, please.
Learn to use it. The children will help you.Now, when I want you, this is what you will hear.- [ Sharp Whistling ]
- No, sir. I'm sorry, sir.I could never answer to a whistle.Whistles are for dogs and cats
and other animals, but not for children...and definitely not for me.It would be too humiliating.FraÃ¼lein...were you this much trouble at the abbey?- Oh, much more, sir.

Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?FraÃ¼lein Josephine, four governesses ago.I'm Brigitta.You, um, didn't tell me how old you are, Louisa.I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.She's 13 years old, and you're smart.I'm 10, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.Why not? Don't you think it's ugly?Of course, but FraÃ¼lein Hilda's was ugliest.I'm Kurt. I'm 11. I'm incorrigible.Congratulations.What's ""incorrigible""?I think it means you want to be treated like a boy.Mm-hmm?I'm Marta, and I'm gonna be seven on Tuesday.And I'd like a pink parasol.Well, pink's my favorite color too.- [ Stomping ]
- Yes, you're Gretl.And you're five years old?My, you're practically a lady.[ Girls Chuckle ]Now I have to tell you a secret-
I've never been a governess before.You mean you don't know anything
about being a governess?Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.Well, the best way to start...is to be sure to tell Father to mind his own business.- You must never come to dinner on time.
- Uh-- Never eat your soup quietly.
- [ Slurps ]And during dessert, always blow your nose.Don't you believe a word they say, FraÃ¼lein Maria.- Why not?
- Because I like you!- Yes.
- [ Clapping ]All right now, children!
Outside for your walk. Father's orders.Now, hurry up, hurry up.
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!- Uh, FraÃ¼lein Maria.
- Mmm.- I'm Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.
- How do you do?How do you do? I'll show you to your room. Follow me.[ Maria ]
Poor little dears.[ Gasps, Screaming ]- Oh!
- You're very lucky.- With FraÃ¼lein Helga, it was a snake.
- [ Exhales ]Good evening.- Good evening, children.
- Good evening, FraÃ¼lein Maria.[ Screams, Laughing ]- [ Groans ]
- Enchanting little ritual.Something you, um, learned at the abbey?No, um, it's, um-um-
[ Patting ]rheumatism.Îmm.Excuse me, Captain.
Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.- Amen.
- [ Children ] Amen.I'd like to thank each and every one of you
for the precious gift...you left in my pocket earlier today.Um, what gift?Itâs meant to be a secret, Captain,
between the children and me.Uh-huh. Then I suggest that you keep it and let us eat.Knowing how nervous I must have been...a stranger in a new household...knowing how important it was for me to feel accepted...it was so kind and thoughtful of you...to make my first moments here so warm...and happy and pleasant.[ Cries ]- What is the matter, Marta?
- Nothing.[ Children Crying ][ Von Trapp ]
FraÃ¼lein.Is it to be at every meal, or merely at dinnertime...that you intend leading us all through this rare...and wonderful new world of indigestion?Oh, they're all right, Captain. They're just happy.[ Crying Louder ][ Doorbell Rings ]- Rolfe, good evening.
- Good evening, Franz.- I trust everything is under control?
- Yes. Yes.Good.- Are there, uh, any developments?
- Perhaps.- Is the captain at home?
- He's at dinner.- With the family?
- Yes.Please give him this telegram at once.Certainly.- A telegram for you, sir.
- Mmm.Franz, who delivered it?That young lad Rolfe, of course.- Father, may I be excused?
- Hmm. Children.In the morning, I shall be going to Vienna.[ All ]
Not again, Father!How long will you be gone this time, Father?I'm not sure, Gretl. Not sure.[ Louisa ]
To visit Baroness Schraeder again?Mind your own business!As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.Why can't we ever get to see the baroness?[ Kurt ]
Why would she want to see you?It just so happens, Marta,
that you are going to see the baroness.I'm bringing her back with me to visit us all.[ Children ]
Good!And Uncle Max.- Uncle Max!
- Uncle Max!Rolfe!Oh, Rolfe.- No, Liesl, we mustn't.
- Why not, silly?- I don't know. Itâs just-
- Isnât this why you're here waiting for me?Yes, of course. I've missed you, Liesl.You have? How much?So much that I even thought
of sending you a telegram...just so I'd be able to deliver it here.Oh, that's a lovely thought. Why don't you, right now?But I'm here.Please, Rolfe, send me a telegram.I'll start it for you. Dear Liesl-Dear Liesl.I'd like to be able to tell you
how I feel about you. Stop.Unfortunately, this wire is already too expensive.- Sincerely, Rolfe.
- ""Sincerely""?- Cordially.
- ""Cordially""?Affectionately?Mmm!Will there be any reply?Dear Rolfe. Stop.Don't stop. Your Liesl.If only we didn't always have to wait...for someone to send Father a telegram.Îow do I know when I'll see you again?Well, let's see.I could come here by mistake...with a telegram for Colonel Schneider.He's here from Berlin, staying with-No one's supposed to know he's here.- Don't tell your father, now.
- Why not?- Well, your father's so- so Austrian.
- We're all Austrian.Well, some people think we ought to be German...and they're very mad at those who don't think so.They're getting ready to-Well, let's hope your father doesn't get into trouble.Don't worry about Father. He's a big naval hero.- He was even decorated by the emperor.
- I know.I don't worry about him,
but I do worry about his daughter.Me? Why?- Well, you're so-
- What?You're such a baby!I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?âª You wait, little girl, on an empty stage âªâª For fate to turn the light on âªâª Your life, little girl, is an empty page âªâª That men will want to write on âªâª To write on âªâª You are sixteen going on seventeen âªâª Baby, it's time to think âªâª Better beware, be canny and careful âªâª Baby, you're on the brink âªâª You are sixteen going on seventeen âªâª Fellows will fall in line âªâª Eager young lads and rouÃ©s and cads âªâª Will offer you food and wine âªâª Totally unprepared are you âªâª To face a world of men âªâª Timid and shy and scared are you âªâª Of things beyond your ken âªâª You need someone older and wiser âªâª Telling you what to do âªâª I am seventeen going on eighteen âªâª I'll take care of you âª[ Thunder Rumbling ][ Thunderclap ]âª I am sixteen going on seventeen âªâª I know that I'm naive âªâª Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet âªâª And willingly I believe âªâª I am sixteen going on seventeen âªâª Innocent as a rose âªâª Bachelor dandies âªâª Drinkers of brandies âªâª What do I know of those âªâª Totally unprepared am I âªâª To face a world of men âªâª Timid and shy and scared am I âªâª Of things beyond my ken âªâª I need someone older and wiser âªâª Telling me what to do âªâª You are seventeen going on eighteen âªâª I'll depend on you âªâª[ Thunder Rumbling ]Whee![ Thunderclaps ]- [ Knocking ]
- Come in.Frau Schmidt.For your new dresses, FraÃ¼lein Maria.The captain had these sent out from town.Oh, how lovely.I'm sure these will make
the prettiest clothes I've ever had.Tell me, do you think the captain would get me
some more material if I asked him?- Îow many dresses does a governess need?
- [ Window Bangs ]No, not for me. For the children.I want to make them some play clothes.The von Trapp children don't play. They march.Surely, you don't approve of that.Ever since the captain lost his poor wife...he- he runs this house
as if he were on one of his ships again.Whistles, orders.No more music, no more laughing.Nothing that reminds him of her.- Even the children.
- But it's so wrong!Oh, well. How do you like your room?- There'll be new drapes at the windows.
- Mmm.New drapes? But these are fine.Nevertheless, new ones have been ordered.Oh, but I really don't need them.- Good night now.
- Frau Schmidt.Do you think if I asked the captain tomorrow
about the material-He's leaving for Vienna in the morning.Oh, yes, of course. Well, how long will he be gone?That all depends.The last time he visited the baroness,
he stayed for a month.Oh.I shouldn't be saying this- not to you.I mean, I don't know you that well.But if you ask me,
the captain's thinking very seriously...of marrying the woman before the summer's over.Oh, that would be wonderful.
The children will have a mother again.Yes. Well, good night.- Good night.
- [ Thunder Rumbling ][ Thunderclap, Rain Falling ]Dear Father, now I know why you've sent me here.To help these children prepare themselves
for a new mother.And I pray that this will become
a happy family in thy sight.God bless the captain. God bless Liesl and Friedrich.God bless Louisa, Brigitta, Marta and little Gretl.And, oh, I forgot the other boy. What's his name?Well, God bless what's-his-name.God bless the reverend mother and Sister Margaretta...and everybody at Nonnberg Abbey.And now, dear God, about Liesl-Îelp her to know that I'm her friend.And help her to tell me what she's been up to.- Are you going to tell on me?
- Shh.Îelp me to be understanding
so that I may guide her footsteps.In the name of the Father and of the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.I was out taking a walk, and somebody
locked the doors earlier than usual...and I didn't want to wake everybody up.So when I saw your window open-You're not going to tell Father, are you?Îmm.Îow in the world did you climb up here?Itâs how we always got into this room
to play tricks on the governess.Louisa can make it
with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.Spiders?Oh. Liesl.Were you out walking all by yourself?You know, if we wash that dress out tonight,
nobody would notice it tomorrow.You could put this on.Take your dress in there.
Put it to soak in the bathtub.Then come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.I told you today I didn't need a governess.Well, maybe I do.[ Thunderclap ]Gretl? Are you scared?[ Thunderclap ]You're not frightened of a thunderstorm, are you?You just stay right here with me. Oh!- Where are the others?
- They're asleep. They're not scared.[ Thunderclap ]Oh, no? Look.All right, everybody. Up here on the bed.- [ Brigitta ] Really?
- Well, just this once. Come on.Now, all we have to do is wait for the boys.You won't see them. Boys are brave.[ Thunderclap ]Uh, you boys weren't scared too, were you?Oh, no. We just wanted to be sure that you weren't.- That's very thoughtful of you, Friedrich.
- It wasn't my idea.It was Kurt's.Kurt! That's the one I left out. God bless Kurt.[ Thunderclap ]Why does it do that?Well, the lightning says something
to the thunder, and the thunder answers back.- The lightning must be nasty.
- Not really.Then why does the thunder get so angry?It makes me want to cry.[ Thunderclap ]Well, now, when anything bothers me
and I'm feeling unhappy...I just try and think of nice things.[ Louisa, Marta ]
What kind of things?Oh! Well, let me see. Nice things-Daffodils!Green meadows.Skies full of stars.Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens.âª Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens âªâª Brown paper packages tied up with strings âª- âª These are a few of my favorite things âª

is to be strictly observed in this house?The children were upset by the storm,
so I thought that if I-You did, sir.And do you or do you not have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?Only during thunderstorms, sir.- [ Kurt Giggles ]
- Liesl?- Yes, Father?
- I don't recall seeing you anywhere after dinner.Oh, really? Well, as a matter of fact-Yes?Well, I- I was-What she would like to say, Captain,
is that she and I...have been getting better acquainted tonight.But it's much too late now to go into all that.Come along, children, you heard your father.
Go back to bed immediately.FraÃ¼lein, you have managed to remember
that I'm leaving in the morning?Is it also possible that you remember...that the first rule in this house is discipline?Then I trust that before I return,
you will have acquired some?Captain.Uh, I wonder if, before you go...I could talk to you about some clothes
for the children, for when they play.- FraÃ¼lein Maria.
- If I could just have some material-You are obviously many things,
not the least of which is repetitious.- But they're children!
- Yes.And I'm their father.

- Mm-hmm?Can we do this every day?Don't you think you'd soon get tired of it, Louisa?I suppose so. Every other day?[ Kurt ] I haven't had so much fun
since the day we put glue...on FraÃ¼lein Josephine's toothbrush.I can't understand how children as nice as you...can manage to play such awful tricks on people.- [ Brigitta ] Oh, it's easy.
- But why do it?- How else can we get Father's attention?
- Yes.Oh, I see.Well, we'll have to think about that one.[ Maria Claps ]
All right, everybody! Over here![ Marta ]
What are we going to do?Let's think of something to sing
for the baroness when she comes.[ Marta ]
Father doesn't like us to sing.Well, perhaps we can change his mind.Now, what songs do you know?- We don't know any songs.
- Not any?- [ Louisa ] We don't even know how to sing.
- [ Liesl ] No.Well, let's not lose any time. You must learn.[ Gretl ]
But how?âª Let's start at the very beginning âªâª A very good place to start âªâª When you read you begin with âªâª A-B-C âªâª When you sing you begin with âªâª Do Re Mi âª[ Children ]

I'm taking back my invitation.You didn't invite me to your villa. I invited myself.Naturally.You needed a chaperone, and I needed
a place to stay where the cuisine is superb...the wine cellar unexcelled and the price, uh, perfect.[ Laughs ]
Max, you are outrageous!Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.- Îmm.

is waiting for Max Detweiler...to pluck it out of obscurity and make it famous

But someday that'll be changed.- I shall get the fame too.

Good heavens, what's this?Oh, it's nothing. Just some local urchins.[ Children Laughing, Chattering, Whooping ][ Sighs ] This really is exciting for me, Georg,
being here with you.[ Laughs ] Trees, lakes, mountains-
when you've seen one, you've seen them all.That is not what I mean, and you know it.Ah, you mean me. I'm exciting.- Is that so impossible?
- No, just, uh, highly improbable.- There you go, running yourself down again.
- Well, I'm a dangerous driver.[ Laughs ]You know, you're much less of a riddle
when I see you here, Georg.- In my natural habitat?
- Yes, exactly.Are you trying to say that I'm more at home here...among the birds and the flowers...and the wind that moves through the trees
like a restless sea, hmm?Îow poetic.Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?More at home here than in Vienna...in all your glittering salons...gossiping gaily with bores I detest,
soaking myself in champagne...stumbling about to waltzes by Strauss
I can't even remember.- Is that what you're trying to say?
- More or less, yes.Now, whatever gave you that idea?[ Sighs ]
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.Itâs so lovely and peaceful.Îow can you leave it as often as you do?Oh, pretending to be madly active, I suppose.Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.Could it be running away from memories?Mm-hmm.Or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay.Oh, I hope that's why
you've been coming to Vienna so often.Or were there other distractions there?Oh, I'd hardly call you a mere distraction, darling.Well, what would you call me, Georg?Îmm. Lovely.Charming, witty, graceful. The perfect hostess.And, uh- Î¥ou're gonna hate me for this-Oh, how unromantic.I would be an ungrateful wretch
if I didn't tell you at least once...that it was you who brought
some meaning back into my life.Oh, I am amusing, I suppose.And I do have the finest couturier in Vienna...and the most glittering circle of friends.- And I do give some rather gay parties.
- [ Laughs ] Yes.But take all that away, and you have just...wealthy, unattached little me searching just like you.[ Chuckles ]More strudel, Herr Detweiler?- Îow many have I had?
- Two.- Make it an uneven three.
- [ Chuckles ]Still eating, Max, hmm? Tsk, tsk. Must be unhappy.That marvelous mixed quartet I've been trying
for months to steal away from Sol Hurok-- What happened, darling?
- Yesterday, Sascha Petrie stole them first.If there's one thing I hate, it's a thief.Max, you really must try and learn to love yourself.For this, I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.- On Georg's telephone, of course?
- How else could I afford it?Oh, dear, I like rich people.I like the way they live.
I like the way I live when I'm with them.I wonder where the children are.Obviously they must have heard
I was coming and went into hiding.I was hoping they'd be here to welcome you.Uh, Max, do step out of character for a moment
and try and be charming.[ Door Opens, Closes ]Well?Well what?Have you made up Georg's mind yet?
Do I hear wedding bells?- Pealing madly.
- Marvelous.- But not necessarily for me.
- What kind of talk's that?That is none-of-your-business talk, Max.I'm terribly fond of Georg,
and I will not have you toying with us.But I'm a child. I like toys.So tell me everything.Oh, come on, tell Max every teensy weensy...intimate, disgusting detail.Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.- Well, I approve of that. How can you miss?
- Far too easily.If I know you, darling, and I do, you will find a way.- Oh, he's no ordinary man.
- No. He's rich.When his wife died,
she left him with a terrible heartache.And when your husband died,
he left you with a terrible fortune.Oh, Max, you really are a beast.You and Georg are like family to me.That's why I want to see you two get married.We must keep all that lovely money in the family.[ Chuckles ]- What are you doing there?
- Captain von Trapp! I was just looking for-I didn't see- I mean,
I didn't know you were- Heil Hitler!Who are you?I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.I'm Herr Detweiler.Yes, sir.All right, you've delivered your telegram. Now get out.Oh, Georg, he's just a boy.Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.What's gonna happen's going to happen.
Just make sure it doesn't happen to you.Max, don't you ever say that again!You know I have no political convictions.
Can I help it if other people do?Oh, yes, you can help it! You must help it.Îello.You're far away. Where are you?In a world that's disappearing, I'm afraid.Is there any way I could bring you
back to the world I'm in?[ Children Chattering ][ Chattering, Screaming ]âª Sew, a needle pulling thread âªâª La, a note to follow sew âªâª Tea, a drink with jam and bread âªâª That will bring us back to Do âª- âª Oh, oh, oh âª

been climbing trees today?- Yes, Captain.
- I see.And where, may I ask, did they get these-- Play clothes.
- Is that what you call them?I made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom.- Drapes?
- They still had plenty of wear left.The children have been everywhere in them.Do you mean to tell me that my children...have been roaming about Salzburg...dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?- Mm-hmm, and having a marvelous time.
- They have uniforms.- Straitjackets, if you'll forgive me.
- I will not forgive you for that.Children cannot do the things they're supposed to do...if they have to worry
about spoiling their precious clothes.- I haven't heard them complain yet.
- They wouldn't dare.They love you too much. They fear you too much.I don't wish you to discuss my children in this manner.You've got to hear from someone.
You're never home long enough-I said I don't want to hear any more from you-I know you don't, but you've got to!- Now, take Liesl-
- You'll not say one word about Liesl.You're gonna wake up and find she's a woman.
You won't even know her.Friedrich wants to be a man like you,
and there's no one to show him how.Don't you dare tell me about my son.Brigitta could tell you about him,
if you'd let her get close to you.She notices everything.Kurt pretends he's tough not to show
how hurt he is when you brush him aside.- That will do.
- The way you do all of them.- Louisa, I don't know about,
but someone has to find out.
- I said that will do!And the little ones just want to be loved.
Oh, please, love them, love them all.I don't care to hear anything further
from you about my children!- I am not finished yet, Captain!
- Oh, yes, you are, Captain-FraÃ¼lein.Now, you will pack your things this minute...and return to the abbey.[ Children ]
âª The hills are alive âª- âª With the sound of music âª
- What's that?[ Liesl ]
âª Ah ah ah ah âª- Itâs singing.
- Yes, I realize it's singing, but who is singing?The children.- âª For a thousand years âª
- âª Ah ah ah ah âªThe children?I taught them something to sing for the baroness.âª With the sound of music âªâª Ah ah ah ah âªâª My heart wants to sing âªâª Every song it hears âªâª Every song that it hears âªâª My heart wants to beat âªâª Like the wings of the birds that rise âªâª From the lake to the trees âªâª To the trees âªâª My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies âªâª From a church on a breeze âªâª To laugh like a brook âª- âªâª [ Humming ]
- âª When it trips and falls over stones on its way âªâª On its way âª- âªâª [ Singing Along ]
- âª To sing through the night âªâª Like a lark who is learning to pray âªâª I go to the hills âª- âª When my heart is lonely âª
- [ Children Stop Singing ]âª I know I will hear âªâª What I've heard before âª- âª My heart will be blessed âª

Oh.Edelweiss.You never told me how enchanting your children are.Don't go away.FraÃ¼lein.I...behaved badly.I apologize.I'm-I'm far too outspoken. Itâs one of my worst faults.You were right.I don't know my children.There's still time, Captain.
They want so much to be close to you.You brought music back into the house.I'd forgotten.FraÃ¼lein.I want you to stay.I ask you to stay.If I could be of any help-You have already. More than you know.[ Maria ]

- [ Von Trapp Laughing ]Bravo!- [ Max ] Bravo!
- Very good!- [ Max ] Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo![ Von Trapp ]
Wonderful.- Can we really keep the puppet show, Uncle Max?
- Yes, may we, Uncle Max?Of course you may, my darlings.Why else would I have told Professor Kohner
to send the bill to your father?- [ Excited Chattering ]
- May we really keep them?- [ Maria ] Whew!
- Well done, fraÃ¼lein.[ Maria Chuckles ]I really am very, very much impressed.They're your children, Captain.My dear, is there anything you can't do?- Well, I'm not sure I'll make a very good nun.
- [ Laughs ]If you have any problems, I'd be happy to help you.[ Max ]
Attention! Attention, everyone.I have an announcement to make. Surprise, surprise.Today, after a long and desperate search...I have finally found a most exciting entry
for the Salzburg Folk Festival.Congratulations, Max.Who will you be exploiting this time?Îa-ha!- The St. Ignatius Choir?
- Guess again.Uh, let me see now. The, um-- The Klopmann Choir?
- No, no, no, no, no.- No, no?
- No, no.- Oh.
- [ Liesl ] Tell us.A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.What a charming idea. Uh, whose family?- [ Laughs ] Yours.
- Oh.- Ah!
- They'll be the talk of the festival.Îmm.- [ Laughs ]
- What's so funny?You are, Max. You're expensive, but very funny.- But you heard them. They'll be a sensation!
- No, Max.- [ Children Groaning ]
- Itâs a wonderful idea. Fresh, original.Max, my children do not sing in public.Well, you can't blame me for trying.Children, who shall we hear from next?- [ Maria ] Who?
- [ Children ] Yes.- [ Softly ] Are you-
- Yes.[ Clears Throat ]
The vote is unanimous.You, Captain.Me? I don't understand.Please.Ah. Huh, huh, huh, huh.No, no, no, no, no, no, no.I'm told that a long time ago you were quite good.Well, that was a very, very, very long time ago.- I remember, Father.
- Play us something we know.- Oh, please, Father.
- Please.Well.- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?To bring along my harmonica.âª Edelweiss âªâª Every morning âªâª You greet me âªâª Small and white âªâª Clean and bright âªâª You look happy âªâª To meet me âªâª Blossom of snow âªâª May you bloom and grow âªâª Bloom and grow âªâª Forever âªâª Edelweiss âªâª Bless my homeland âªâª Forever âªâª Edelweiss âª[ Together ]

you can be part of my new act-- [ Chuckles ]
- The Von Trapp Family Singers.I have a wonderful idea, Georg.Let's really fill this house with music.You must give a grand and glorious party
for me while I'm here.- A party?
- [ Children ] Please, Father! Please!I think it's high time I met all your friends
here in Salzburg and they met me.- Don't you agree?
- I see what you mean.- [ Children ] Oh, please, Father!
- Itâs time to go to bed.Come, now, say good night.- [ Louisa ] Good night, Father.
- [ Gretl ] Good night, Father.- [ Baroness ] Good night.
- [ Von Trapp ] Good night.Good night, Baroness Schraeder. Good night, Father.[ Marta ]
Good night, Father.Good night.[ Friedrich ]
Good night, Uncle Max.It'll be my first party, Father!- Captain.
- Evening, Herr Zeller.Baroness Schraeder. Îerr Zeller.- Good evening, Îerr Zeller.
- Baroness.- How do you do?
- Baroness Schraeder.Good evening.I suppose you noticed the obvious display
of the Austrian flag in the hallway?- The women look so beautiful.
- I think they look ugly.You just say that because you're scared of them.Silly, only grown-up men are scared of women.I think the men look beautiful.Îow would you know?- Liesl, who are you dancing with?
- Nobody.[ Brigitta ]
Oh, yes, you are.- May I have this dance?
- I'd be delighted, young man.Why didn't you children tell me you could dance?We were afraid you'd make us all dance together.The Von Trapp Family Dancers.âªâª [ Orchestra: Waltz ][ Gretl ]
What's that they're playing?Itâs the lÃ¤ndler. Itâs an Austrian folk dance.- Show me.
- Kurt, I haven't danced that since I was a little girl.Oh, you remember. Please?- Well-
- Please.All right. Come on over here.- Now you bow, and I curtsy.
- Like this?Fine. Now we go for a little walk. This way.One, two, three. One, two, three.One, two, three. Step together.Now, step, hop. Step, hop.Now, turn under.Not quite. This way. Îop, step, hop.And under.- Kurt, we'll have to practice.
- Um, do allow me, will you?[ Kurt ]
Mm-hmm.I don't remember any more.- Your face is all red.
- Is it?I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.[ Applause ]That was beautifully done.What a lovely couple you make.Yes. I think it's time the children said good night.Yes, we'll be in the hall in a moment.
We've got something very special prepared.- Right?
- [ Brigitta ] Right.[ Maria ]
Come on!All that needless worrying, Georg.You thought you wouldn't find a friend at the party.A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?Oh, I don't know.It seemed rather warm to me.[ Whistling Through Teeth ][ Maria ]
Ladies and gentlemen...the children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.âª There's a sad sort of clanging
from the clock in the hall âªâª And the bells in the steeple too âªâª And up in the nursery an absurd little bird âªâª Is popping out to say cuckoo âªâª Cuckoo, cuckoo âª- âª Regretfully they tell us âª
- âª Cuckoo âª- âª But firmly they compel us âª
- âª Cuckoo âª- âª To say good-bye âª
- âª Cuckoo âªâª To you âªâª So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night âªâª I hate to go and leave this pretty sight âªâª So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu âªâª Adieu, adieu to you and you and you âªâª So long, farewell, au revoir, auf Wiedersehen âªâª I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne âª- Yes?
- No.[ Laughing ]âª So long, farewell âªâª Auf Wiedersehen, good-bye âªâª I leave and heave a sigh and say good-bye âªâª Good-bye âªâª I'm glad to go âªâª I cannot tell a lie âªâª I flit, I float âªâª I fleetly flee, I fly âªâª The sun âªâª Has gone to bed âªâª And so must I âªâª So long âªâª Farewell âªâª Auf Wiedersehen âªâª Good-bye âªâª Good-bye âªâªThey're extraordinary.
What they would do at the festival!- Oh, young lady, I must have words with you.
- Congratulations.Georg, you're not going to let this girl get away.
She has to join the party.- No, really, I-
- Shh. Stop. Stop it.- Georg, please.
- You can if you want to, fraÃ¼lein.I insist. You will be my dinner partner.
This is business.Franz, set another place next to mine
for FraÃ¼lein Maria.Why- Whatever you say, Herr Detweiler.It appears to be all arranged, doesn't it?- It certainly does.
- I'm not suitably dressed.Uh, well, you can change. We'll wait for you.All right.Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.I am. Thank you, Baroness.Is there a more beautiful expression...of what is good in this country of ours...than the innocent voices of our children?Oh, come, now, Baron, would you have us believe...that Austria alone holds a monopoly on virtue?Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song...to ugly German threats.The ostrich buries his head in the sand...and sometimes... in the flag.Perhaps those who would warn you
that the Anschluss is coming-and it is coming, Captain-
perhaps they would get further with you...by setting their words to music.If the Nazis take over Austria, I have no doubt
that you will be the entire trumpet section.- You flatter me, Captain.
- Oh, how clumsy of me.I meant to accuse you.Itâs very kind of you to offer to help me, Baroness.I'm delighted, Maria.I really don't think I do have anything
that would be appropriate.Now, where is that lovely little thing...you were wearing the other evening...when the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you?Couldn't keep his eyes off me?Come, my dear, we are women.Let's not pretend
we don't know when a man notices us.- Here we are.
- The captain notices everybody and everything.There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria.You are quite attractive, you know.The captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.Baroness, I hope you're joking.- Not at all.
- But I've never done a thing to-But you don't have to, my dear.There's nothing more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.- In love with him?
- Of course.But what makes it so nice
is he thinks he's in love with you.But that's not true.Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes.And, you know, uh, you blushed in his arms...when you were dancing just now.Don't take it to heart.He'll get over it soon enough, I should think.
Men do, you know.Then I should go.I mustn't stay here.- Is there something I can do to help?
- No, nothing.Yes.Please don't say a word about this to the captain.No. No, I wouldn't dream of it.Good-bye, Maria.I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.Champagne, darling.I feel like celebrating.Cheers.- You know something?
- Perhaps.Then if you're so clever,
tell me how to get our little fraÃ¼lein...to use her influence with Georg.I want those children in the festival.Elsa, this is important to Austria.It wouldn't do you any harm either.I've thought of that.Well, if it's a matter of influence...maybe the one you'll have to be talking to is me.âªâª [ Orchestra ]- [ Kurt ] Two.

do you mind if we stop now? We're tired.Oh, whatever you want, dear.We'll do it again tomorrow.The country's so restful, isn't it?Have some lemonade.Oh. There must be an easier way.I get a fiendish delight
thinking of you as the mother of seven.- Mm-hmm.
- How do you plan to do it?Darling, haven't you ever heard of a delightful
little thing called boarding school?Baroness Machiavelli.Mm-hmm.[ Brigitta ]
Uncle Max, where's Father?[ Max ]
I think he's in the house.- What's the matter with all you gloomy pusses?
- Nothing.- I know what we'll do. Let's have a rehearsal.
- What for?Let's make believe we're standing
on the stage at the festival.[ Marta ]
I don't feel like singing.Not without FraÃ¼lein Maria.[ Max ]
Liesl, get the guitar. Come on, Marta.Everybody into the group.
You know your places in the group.Get in your places. That's right.
Be cheerful. Give us the key, Liesl.Now, impress me.- âª Ah âª
- âª Ah âªFriedrich, Gretl, why don't you sing?I can't. I've got a sore finger.But you sang so beautifully the night of the party.Come on, all of you. Try something you know.Enjoy it. Be cheerful. All right, Liesl.âª The hills are alive âªâª With the sound of music âª[ Liesl ]

- No, thank you, darling.- Father?
- Yes, Brigitta?Is it true FraÃ¼lein Maria isn't coming back?FraÃ¼lein Maria? Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?[ Baroness ]
Pink lemonade.- Laced with, uh, lemonade.
- Ooh.I don't believe it, Father.Îmm? Don't believe what, darling?- About FraÃ¼lein Maria.
- Oh, FraÃ¼lein Maria!Didn't I tell you what her note said?
Oh, I'm sure I did.She said she missed her life at the abbey too much.She had to leave us.And that's all there is to it.I think I'm brave enough to try some of that.She didn't even say good-bye.- She did in her note.
- [ Louisa ] That isn't the same thing.Not too sweet, not too sour.Just too, uh, pink.- [ Gretl ] Father.
- Hmm?Who is our new governess going to be?Well.You're not going to have a governess anymore.- [ Children ] We're not?
- No.You're going to have a new mother.A new mother?We talked about it last night.Itâs all settled, and we're all going to be very happy.Hmm?Well, all right, all right, all right.
Now, run off and play.[ Doorbell Rings ]Yes, my children?- Uh, my name is Liesl.
- Yes, Liesl?We- my brothers and sisters-
we want to see FraÃ¼lein Maria.FraÃ¼lein Maria?Oh, Maria!Come in, please.Wait here.I'm Sister Margaretta.
I understand you've been inquiring about Maria.We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here, please?I'm afraid I can't do that.- You've got to. We have to see her.
- She's our governess.- We want her back!
- [ Kurt ] She didn't even say good-bye.- Itâs very important.
- All we want to do is talk to her.I'm very sorry, children, but Maria is in seclusion.She hasn't been seeing anyone.- She'll see us. I know she will.
- I want to show her my finger.Oh, some other time, dear.I'll tell her that you were here.
It was sweet of you to call.- [ Brigitta ] Oh, we have to speak to her!
- [ Marta ] Please!- [ Children Clamoring ]
- Run along, children. Run along home.- [ Friedrich ] Sister Margaretta!
- [ Girls ] Please! Please!- Good-bye, children.
- Please. Please.What was that about, Sister Margaretta?The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.
They want to see Maria.Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.Poor child.Itâs strange. She seems happy to be back here...and yet- and yet she's unhappy too.Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.I think you'd better bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.Yes, Reverend Mother.Sister Augusta,
take our new postulant to the robing room.God bless you, my daughter.- [ Knocking ]
- Ave!Yes, bring her in.You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.Reverend Mother.Why did they send you back to us?They didn't send me back, Mother. I left.Sit down, Maria. Tell me what happened.Well, I- I was frightened.Frightened? Were they unkind to you?Oh, no. No, I was- I was confused.I- I felt-I've never felt that way before. I couldn't stay.I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.What is it you can't face?- I can't face him again.
- Him?Thank you, Sister Margaretta.Captain von Trapp?- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!I don't know, I- The baroness said I was.She- She said that he was in love with me...but I didn't want to believe it.Oh, there were times
when we would look at each other...oh, Mother, I could hardly breathe.- Did you let him see how you felt?
- If I did, I didn't know it.That's what's been torturing me.
I was there on God's errand.To have asked for his love would have been wrong.I couldn't stay. I just couldn't!I'm ready at this moment to take my vows.Please help me.Maria, the love of a man and a woman is holy too.You have a great capacity to love.What you must find out
is how God wants you to spend your love.But I've pledged my life to God.
I- I've pledged my life to his service.My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.No.You must find out.You must go back.Mother, you can't ask me to do that.
Please let me stay. I beg of you.Maria, these walls were not built...to shut out problems.You have to face them.You have to live the life you were born to live.âª Climb every mountain âªâª Search high and low âªâª Follow every byway âªâª Every path you know âªâª Climb every mountain âªâª Ford every stream âªâª Follow every rainbow âªâª Till you find your dream âªâª A dream that will need âªâª All the love you can give âªâª Every day of your life âªâª For as long as you live âªâª Climb every mountain âªâª Ford every stream âªâª Follow every rainbow âªâª Till you find your dream âªâª A dream that will need âªâª All the love you can give âªâª Every day of your life âªâª For as long as you live âªâª Climb every mountain âªâª Ford every stream âªâª Follow every rainbow âªâª Till you find âªâª Your dream âªâªNow, it's not like my children to be secretive.[ Louisa ]
We're not being secretive, Father.Mm-hmm. And it's not like my children
to be late for dinner.- We lost track of the time.
- Ah.- [ Children ] Yes!
- I see.Who's going to be the first one to tell me the truth?Friedrich? Brigitta? Liesl?Where do you think we were, Father?Îmm? Now-Well, if you don't believe us, you must
have some idea where you think we were.- [ Giggling ]
- Aha! Marta!- [ Marta ] Yes, Father.
- You tell me.Friedrich told you, Father. We were berry picking.I forgot. You were berry picking!- [ Children ] Yeah! Yeah!
- All afternoon?- We picked thousands of them.
- Thousands?- [ Kurt ] I got the most.
- What kind of berries?- Uh, blueberries, sir.
- Blueberries! Mmm![ Children ]
Yes! Yes, of course!Itâs, uh, too early for blueberries.- They were strawberries.
- Strawberries?Itâs been so cold lately, they turned blue.Aw!
[ Clicking Tongue ]Very well. Show me the berries.- [ Brigitta ] We-
- [ Louisa ] Well-- Show me the berries you picked. Come on.
- We don't have them anymore.You don't have them anymore?
Well, what happened to them?- We- We-
- We ate them!- You ate them?
- Yes!- All of them?
- They were delicious!Very well.Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves...full of thousands of delicious berries,
you can't be hungry anymore...so I'll just have to simply tell Frau Schmidt...to, uh, skip your dinner.Itâs all your fault! We should have told him the truth.And made him boiling mad at us?[ Kurt ]
Itâs better than starving to death.[ Louisa ] We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.My stomach's making noises.The least they could have done was to let us say hello.I wonder what grass tastes like.I feel awful.[ Brigitta ]
When FraÃ¼lein Maria wanted to feel better...- she used to sing that song, remember?
- Yes.Let's try it.âª Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens âªâª Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens âªâª Brown paper packages tied up with strings âªâª These are a few of my favorite things âªWhy don't I feel better?âª Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes âª[ Maria's Voice Joins In ]
âª Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes âª- âª Silver white winters âª
- [ Kurt ] FraÃ¼lein Maria, she's back!âª That melt into springs âªâª These are a few of my favorite things âªâª When the dog bites âª- âª When the bee stings âª
- [ Friedrich ] FraÃ¼lein Maria!âª When I'm feeling sad âªâª I simply remember my favorite things âªâª And then I don't feel âªâª So bad âªâª- Oh, children, I'm so glad to see you!
- We missed you!Oh, I missed you. Kurt, how are you?Îungry.- Gretl, what happened to your finger?
- It got caught.- Caught in what?
- Friedrich's teeth.- Liesl, you all right?
- Just fair.Many telegrams been delivered here lately?None at all, fraÃ¼lein, but I'm learning to accept it.- I'll be glad when school begins.
- Oh, Liesl.You can't use school to escape your problems.
You have to face them.Oh, I have so much to tell you all.- We have things to tell you too.
- I'm sure you do.The most important thing
is that Father is going to be married.Married?Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.Oh, I see.[ Brigitta ]
Oh, Father, look![ Friedrich ]
FraÃ¼lein Maria's come back from the abbey!- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening.All right, everyone inside. Go and get your dinner.[ Kurt ]
Dinner!You left without saying good-bye...even to the children.Well, it was wrong of me. Forgive me.- Why did you?
- Please don't ask me.Anyway, the reason no longer exists.[ Baroness ]
FraÃ¼lein Maria.You've returned.Isnât it wonderful, Georg?May I wish you every happiness, Baroness,
and you too, Captain.The children tell me you're to be married.Thank you, my dear.You are back to, uh, stay?Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.[ Baroness ]
There you are!I really must speak to cook about the wiener schnitzel.It is entirely too delicious for my figure.And it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table.- Hmm.
- Or was it the wine?Oh, undoubtedly the wine.You have no idea what kind of trouble I'm having...trying to decide what to give you
for a wedding present.Oh, I know, I'm enough, but I do want you to have...some little trifle for the occasion.At first, I thought of a fountain pen,
but you've already got one.And then I thought perhaps
a villa in the south of France...but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.Georg, how do you feel about yachts?A long, sleek one for the Mediterranean...or a tiny one for your bathtub, hmm?- Elsa.
- And where to go on our honeymoon?Now, that is a real problem.
I thought a trip around the world would be lovely.Then I said, ""Oh, Elsa,
there must be someplace better to go.""- Don't worry, darling. I-
- Elsa.Yes, Georg?Itâs no use...you and I.I'm being dishonest to both of us...and utterly unfair to you.- When two people talk of marriage-
- No, don't.Don't say another word, Georg, please.You see, um-There are other things I've been thinking of.Fond as I am of you...I really don't think you're the right man for me.You're, um- You're much too independent.And I- I need someone who needs me desperately...or at least needs my money desperately.I've enjoyed every moment we've had together.
I do thank you for that.Now, if you'll forgive me,
I'll go inside, pack my little bags...and return to Vienna, where I belong.And somewhere out there is a young lady who I think...will never be a nun.Auf Wiedersehen, darling.[ Von Trapp ]
Hello.I thought I just might find you here.Was there something you wanted?Hmm?No, no, no, no. Sit down. Please.Please.Uh, may I?[ Chuckles ]
You know, I was-I was thinking and I was wondering two things.Why did you run away to the abbey?And...what was it that made you come back?Well, I had an obligation to fulfill...and I- I came back to fulfill it.Hmm. Is that all?And I missed the children.Yes. Only the children?No. Yes! Isnât it right I should have missed them?Oh, yes! Yes, of course!I was only hoping that perhaps you-Perhaps you might, uh-Yes?Well, uh-Nothing was the same when you were away...and it'll be all wrong again after you leave.And I just thought perhaps
you might, uh, change your mind?I'm sure the baroness
will be able to make things fine for you.Maria.There isn't going to be any baroness.There isn't?No.I don't understand.Well, we've, um, called off
our engagement, you see, and-- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yes.- You are?
- Mm-hmm.- You did?
- Yes.Well, you can't marry someone when you're...in love with someone else.Can you?[ Maria Sighs ]
The reverend mother always says...""When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere he opens a window.""What else does the reverend mother say?That you have to look for your life.Is that why you came back?And have you found it...Maria?I think I have.I know I have.I love you.Oh, can this be happening to me?âª Perhaps I had a wicked childhood âªâª Perhaps I had a miserable youth âªâª But somewhere in my wicked, miserable past âªâª There must have been a moment of truth âªâª For here you are âªâª Standing there âªâª Loving me âªâª Whether or not âªâª You should âªâª So somewhere in my youth âªâª Or childhood âªâª I must have done something good âªâª Nothing comes from nothing âªâª Nothing ever could âªâª So somewhere in my youth âªâª Or childhood âªâª I must have done âªâª Something âªâª Good âªâªDo you know when I first started loving you?That night at the dinner table
when you sat on that ridiculous pine cone.- [ Laughing ]

Herr Detweiler!- Heil Hitler.
- Oh. Good afternoon, Herr Zeller.Perhaps you've not heard. I'm now the gauleiter.- Heil Hitler.
- Uh, heil Hitler.I have just come from the house
of Captain von Trapp...incidentally, the only one in the neighborhood...not flying the flag of the Third Reich
since the Anschluss.- But we have dealt with that situation.
- I don't think-The housekeeper told me that I would find you here.It was the only information the woman would give me.What kind of information are you looking for?We want to know when the captain will be returning.Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.Uh, he's not been in touch with us.Are you asking me to believe that the captain...has not communicated
with his children in over a month?Herr Zeller, how many men do you know...who communicate with their children
while on their honeymoon?When he does return, he will be expected to fill...his proper position in the new order.Naturally, naturally. And may I
congratulate you- that is, your people-on deciding to allow the festival
to go on tonight as planned?Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.Singing and music will show this to the world.Austria is the same.Îeil Hitler.Îeil Hitler.
[ Sniffs ]Come on, children, let's go home.- Why was he so cross?
- Everybody's cross these days, darling.[ Marta ] Maybe the flag with the black spider
on it makes people nervous.- Is Father going to be in trouble?
- He doesn't have to be.The thing to do these days
is to get along with everybody.I want you all to remember that tonight at the concert.Are we really going to sing
before a whole lot of people tonight?Of course. Look, the Von Trapp Family Singers.And here are your names- Liesl, Friedrich...Louisa, Brigitta, Kurt, Marta and Gretl.Why am I always last?- Because you are the most important.
- Oh!There we go.[ Brigitta ] Uncle Max, are you sure Father
will approve of our singing in public?Oh, he'll be pleased and proud.- Liesl, do you think so?
- Don't you trust me?- [ Brigitta ] No!
- You're a very intelligent girl.- [ Chuckles ]
- [ Rolfe ] Liesl! Liesl![ Liesl ]
Rolfe!- Rolfe, I'm so glad to see you. Itâs been such-
- Good afternoon.You will take this, please, and deliver it
to your father as soon as he comes home.- Îe's on his honeymoon.
- I know that.- You do?
- We make it our business to know
everything about everyone.- Who's we?
- See that he gets it.- What is it?
- Itâs a telegram from Berlin.Don't you want to come over tonight
and deliver it yourself?I am now occupied with more important matters...and your father better be, too,
if he knows what's good for him.But, Rolfe-Father! Father!- We didn't expect you so soon.
- Hello, hello, hello!- When did you get back?
- We didn't expect you home until next week.[ Kurt ]
Did you bring us any souvenirs from Paris?[ Maria ]
Hello! How are you?[ Friedrich ]
Why didn't you telephone us?We tried to, but we couldn't get through.I had nothing to do with that, Georg.We came back as fast as we could.Well, well, well, well, well! We missed you!We missed kissing you good night.We missed all the noise you make
in the morning telling each other to be quiet.- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
- Oh, you came back just in time.Look, FraÃ¼lein Maria- I mean, Mother.- We're going to sing in the festival tonight.
- What?- [ All Chattering ]
- Yes, we've been rehearsing all-Surprise, surprise!All right, surprises for you on the terrace.[ Marta ]
Presents!We'll talk about this inside.I would have told you, but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.- I was fortunate to enter them at all.
- Max.- They'll be the talk of the festival.
- Max.lmagine, seven children in one family.Max!Somehow I recall having made it quite clear to you...how I feel about my family singing in public.But the committee heard them. They were enchanted.- What did they say?
- I have never heard such enthusiasm.Oh, darling, don't you think- just this once?Absolutely out of the question.Georg, this is for Austria.For Austria? There is no Austria!But the Anschluss happened peacefully.- Let's at least be grateful for that.
- Grateful?You know, Max...sometimes I don't believe I know you.Father, I forgot. This is for you.[ Door Opens, Closes ]Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.You must convince him.- Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.
- Then I'll talk to him.If the children don't sing at the festival,
well, it will be a reflection on Austria.Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either.- Mother?
- Hmm?- That sounds so nice. I like calling you mother.
- I like hearing it.- You love Father very much. I can tell you do.
- Very much.Mother, what do you do
when you think you love someone-I mean, when you stop loving someone...or he stops loving you?Well, you cry a little.And then you wait for the sun to come out.
It always does.There are so many things
I think I should know, but I don't.- I really don't.
- How can you?Sometimes I feel the world is coming to an end.And then you feel it's just beginning?- Yes.
- It was that way with me, Liesl.And for you, it will be just as wonderful, I promise.Do you really think so?âª When you're sixteen going on seventeen âªâª Waiting for life to start âªâª Somebody kind who touches your mind âªâª Will suddenly touch your heart âªâª When that happens âªâª After it happens âªâª Nothing is quite the same âªâª Somehow I know I'll jump up and go âªâª If ever he calls my name âªâª Gone are your old ideas of life âªâª The old ideas grow dim âªâª Lo and behold, you're someone's wife âªâª And you belong to him âªâª You may think this kind of adventure âªâª Never may come to you âªâª Darling sixteen, going on seventeen âªâª Wait a year âª- âª Or two âª

Liesl.- What is it?
- Berlin.They've offered me a commission in their navy.I've been requested to accept immediately...and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.I knew something like this would happen...but I didn't think it would be so soon.To refuse them would be fatal for all of us.And joining them would be... unthinkable.Get the children all together.Don't say anything that's going to make them worry.Just get them ready.We've got to get out of Austria...and this house...tonight.[ Crickets Chirping ][ Max ]
It strains my back, it breaks my heart...when I think of a certain singing group
that will not appear at the festival tonight.By the time you've made the announcement,
we'll be over the border.- I hope you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making.
- You have no choice.I know. That's why I'm making it.[ Marta ]
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?- Because he doesn't want anyone to hear us!
- Shh![ Louisa ] What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say
when they discover we're gone?They'll be able to answer truthfully.They didn't know anything about it
if anyone asks them.- Will we be coming back here?
- Someday, Liesl.I do hope someday.[ Gretl ] Are Father and Uncle Max
going to push the car...- all the way to Switzerland?
- Shh!Something wrong with your car, Captain?Yes, as a matter of fact, we couldn't get it started.Karl.Fix Captain von Trapp's car so that it will start.[ Car Engine Starts ]Excellent, Karl.I've not asked you
where you and your family are going.Nor have you asked me why I'm here.Well, apparently, we're both suffering
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.You were sent a telegram, which you did not answer.A telegram from Admiral von Schreiber
of the navy of the Third Reich.I was under the impression, Herr Zeller...that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private!At least the Austria I know.I have my orders.And they are to take you personally
to Bremerhaven tonight...where you will accept your commission.I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.You see, we, uh-uh, all of us- the entire family-will be... singing in the festival tonight.As a matter of fact, that's where we were going now.Couldn't possibly let them down now.I just hope we're not too late.Yes.And you ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp, are singing in a concert?Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.Like you, Herr Zeller...I, too, am a man of hidden talents.[ Max ]
Yes, um- Here.The program.It says here only the names of the children.It says the Von Trapp Family Singers...and I'm the head of the von Trapp family, am I not?And these, um, travel clothes that you're all wearing?Our costumes, naturally.Îerr Zeller, this night air is not good
for the children's voices.Well, a slight delay in my orders will not be serious.Therefore you will sing.You will all sing, but only because
that's the way I want it to be.It will demonstrate
that nothing in Austria has changed.And when you are finished singing...you, Captain von Trapp, will be taken to Bremerhaven.Now, if you will all get into your car...we will escort the Von Trapp Family Singers
to the festival.No escort will be necessary, Îerr Zeller.Necessary? A pleasure, Captain.After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds...would we?No.[ Car Engines Start ]- [ Maria ] âª Sew, a needle pulling thread âª

- No, I didn't.Joanna and I talk a great deal.And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.And it took a lot of courage for her
to walk out of here.How much courage does it take
to walk out on your kid?Where's Mommy?- What?
- Where's Mommy?What time is it?The little hand's on the 7, the big
hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?Oh, God. Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
You want to know where Mommy is?- She's supposed to take me to school.
- She told me to do it.Okay, I'll tell you where she went.You know when you and your friends
don't get along and fight?And you want to go and be alone
for a while?Sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don't get along......and one of them wants to go
and be by themselves for a while.- When is Mommy coming back?
- Soon.Now we are gonna have breakfast!
Okay? Just you and me.- What do you want?
- French toast.You want French toast, you got it.Put up a little water for Daddy
to have some coffee.We got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.We got milk.We got butter.We got $5.I got $5.
Here, you sit here.Okay, can you be my number one helper?Watch this. One hand.Here we go.Did you know that all
the best chefs are men?Isn't this terrific?
We gotta do this more often.- You dropped some shell in it.
- That's okay.Makes it crunchier.
You like it crunchy, don't you?Why don't you beat them,
and I'll get everything else going.- What time is school?
- 8:30.Gotta get the show on the road.
I gotta shower, shave and shampoo.I got people to see.And Daddy's gotta bring home
the bacon......and he's gotta cook it.We're having a good time!
Where does Mommy keep the...?- In the stove.
- The pan. The stove.First, we need a nice fire.No, you're not doing it right.Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It's the wrist.So the gucky part dissolves.Then you take the bread, and we...We...We fold the French toast.
That's what we do.- I think you forgot milk.
- I didn't. Milk comes last.When you're having a good time
you forget things.I just wanted to see
if you're paying attention.Fun, isn't it? When's the last
time Mommy let you in the kitchen?I don't like it in pieces.It tastes the same whether it's in
pieces or whole. Bread is bread.Besides, French toast
is always folded.In the best restaurants,
you see folded French toast.You get more bites that way.And while that's going,
Daddy's gonna make coffee.You having a good time?I don't remember the last
time I had such a good time.Daddy's gonna make himself coffee.- That's too much!
- No, I like it strong.Mommy always makes it too weak.Can I have some orange juice?Right. One OJ coming up
for the kid.Daddy, it's burning!- What?
- It's burning!Damn it! Goddamn her!Oh, shit.Just take it easy.
Everything is fine. We're terrific.Just...Just take it easy.
Nothing is the matter.- What?
- Your hand's sweaty.- When's Mommy coming back?
- Soon. I told you.- Is she gonna pick me up?
- Probably. If she doesn't, I will.- What if you forget?
- I won't.- What if you get run over?
- Mommy will pick you up.- Miss! What grade are you in?
- First.This is Billy Kramer.
He's in first grade.Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I'm late. Taxi!Taxi!- Congratulations about Mid-Atlantic.
- Thanks.- Congratulations.
- Is the stuff back from the retoucher?- Great news, Ted.
- Thanks a lot.Morning. 11:00, meeting
with Airwick...- Where's the stuff from the retoucher?
- Right here.- Did my wife call?
- No.You're gonna have to cancel
the Airwick at 11:30.She's never gone this far before,
but in the past......l've known
when she's upset because......she gets very quiet.Our pattern has been that I've said,
""What's the matter?""......and she'll kind of sit on it.But in the last few weeks,
maybe couple of months......since we've been going crazy
with this account, I've been remiss.And I just didn't look at the writing
on the wall, so she's kind of...I think this is a way
of making me stop, look and say:"" I'm as important as your work.""Is there another guy?I don't think so.
She's not the type.She's got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs......you know, women's lib.
I think they may have cooked this up.It worked.I'm going crazy!Look, not to worry.She'll be back.I didn't know it would happen to me!Don't let it get you down.I know she'll be back.
I'm terrific, really.- You do have a problem, Ted.
- Yeah, what's that?What are you gonna do about Billy?This just happened last night.
I'm sure when Joanna comes back...It's none of my business.
I'll butt out.Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.I appreciate you
taking the time to talk to me.May sound a little rough, but......I think you ought to send Billy away
to stay with relatives for a while.You mean, until Joanna comes back?Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?Gee, I don't know...Ted, listen to me.I just told the boys upstairs you're
handling the Mid-Atlantic account.You know? A gig like that comes
along once every five, six years.There's guys here eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.This is important. Don't blow this.I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 110 percent......7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that.I can't be concerned about you
worrying about a kid.First, you can count on me
25 hours a day, 8 days a week.Because I'm not a loser, Jim.I never let anything at home
come into the office.You asked me to unload in this office.When I go outside, I'm on top of it.
I want you to know that.I'm a survivor.You've given me a shot here.
I'm not gonna let anything blow it.Okay?Let's have a drink later.
I'm all right. I gotta......blow smoke up Airwick's ass, 11:00.I'm all right!You don't worry.Thank you.I love you, you bastard.Daddy?Daddy?Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.Let me get this copy done,
and then I'll talk.What time is it when an elephant
sits on your fence?Time to get a new fence.Honey, please...
I just got this sentence.Daddy! Daddy!Goddamn it! Goddamn it!Get over there and sit
on that couch and don't move!I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!Who told you not to drink
this stuff here?- Sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.Told you to keep that juice
in the dining room!Sorry.Who took you to the park, gave you
everything you wanted?- Who bought you an ice cream?
- You.And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you'd let him work?- That's ruined. I can't fix that.
- Sorry.It's past your bedtime.
Why don't you go to sleep?And brush your teeth
and flush the toilet.- Paper towels. What else?
- We need detergent.All right.No, Mommy buys the kind
with the orange circles on it.- There's no difference.
- Mom said it was the best.- Let's go.
- Get the pink stuff.All right, come on.Okay. That's it.We need some cereal.Okay, what colour?Hey, Billy!Billy! Told you Mommy would write
before the week was up.- When is she coming back?
- That's what we're gonna find out now.Okay. Let's read it."" My dearest, sweet Billy.""That's you."" Mommy has gone away.Sometimes in the world......daddies go away......and mommies bring up
their little boys.But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too......and you have your daddy
to bring you up.I have gone away
because I must find......something interesting to do
for myself in the world.Everybody has to, and so do I.Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too......and this is what I have to do.I did not get a chance
to tell you this......and that is why
I'm writing you now.I will always be your mommy......and I will always love you.I just won't be your mommy
in the house......but I'll be your mommy
at the heart.And now I must go
and be the person I have to be.""We'll read this another time.I don't care.- Good night, Jim.
- Come on in.- Have a drink.
- I can't, I'm late now.What's the rush? We're having
a party for Norman. Five years here.Can you believe it?Wish I could, but I'm late.
I gotta pick up Billy.You know Jerry Hoover, in media?Tell you something funny.Gotta go. See you Monday.Taxi!Taxi!- Here, keep the change.
- Thanks.Hi, Mrs. Kline. I'm sorry I'm late.That's all right, but Billy is upset.Hey, how's it going, sport?I had a little trouble
getting away from the office.Sorry. Come on, let's get going.Thanks for coming, Billy.
Oh, wait a minute.- Don't forget your goody bag.
- Thanks very much.- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.- So, did you have a lot of fun?
- You're late.- I'm not that late. Only 20 minutes.
- Want to bet?All the other mothers were there
before you.Why are you making such a big deal
of it? There was traffic.If you want to be a big boy......you learn that when somebody says
they're sorry......you don't hold a grudge
and make them feel bad for......a long time afterwards.Okay, go ahead.Don't eat with your fingers.
Come on, Billy.You know better than that.
Here.Use a fork.Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.How was school today?Same as usual.I see the Knicks finally won a game.I don't care.What do you mean?- I like Boston.
- Boston? Why do you like Boston?Because Mommy's from Boston.Sit up and try to eat. Come on.Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.Too much birthday cake?Yeah, I guess.I'm sorry. Excuse me.Louise, give me a hand.You're 15 minutes late.- Mr. O'Connor is very upset.
- This all of it?- Yes. Do you want your mail now?
- No, just give me the messages.Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.Okay, okay.Sorry I'm late.And there's a PTA meeting
at the school on Tuesday at 4.Right, thanks.Put the chicken in the refrigerator.Know who Charley's seeing now?Who?A divorced woman with two little girls
the same age as Kim and Petey.- Are you kidding?
- No.How do you know?I know.How long has it been since
you two broke up?Year and a half.That long?Did I ever tell you how sorry......how sad Joanna and I were
when you guys split?Look at that cute little boy
over there.You think you'll ever
get married again?- I mean, to anybody.
- No.Why?Maybe it's different if you don't
have children, but......even if Charley and I aren't living
together, and even if we're......sleeping with other people, even
if he were to get married again......he's still my husband......and he's still the father of my
children and...That stuff about ""till death do you
part,"" that's really true.Let's say Charley finishes
his midlife crisis......he's had it with his flings
and comes asking for forgiveness.What would you do?I think that if he really loved me......he wouldn't have let me
divorce him.You still think about him, don't you?Only all the time.- Think about Joanna?
- Never.Liar.Some pair, boy.I don't believe it.- You missed the closing.
- I'm sorry.Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm getting very nervous here.Ever since your wife left you.
Is it eight months now?You're not getting any better.What do you mean?Look, I can't let your family problems
interfere with my responsibilities.I got a shop to run.I regret it, and I promise you
it will never happen again.Okay?Yeah?Yeah, wait a minute.- It's for you, pick up 461.
- Who is it?Pick up 461.Yeah?Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?No, one hour of television a day.
That's the rule.No.I don't care what the other
mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.I can't talk now. I'm busy.We will talk about it tonight
when I get home, all right?Double chocolate chip. I remember.I'm getting very nervous.Put that down and eat your dinner.What is this crap?- It's Salisbury steak.
- I hate it.You had it last week and you loved it.No, I didn't. I hate the brown
stuff. It's gross.- It's onions and gravy.
- I'm allergic to onions.You are not.
You had this last week......and I said it was my favourite and you
said, "" It's my favourite too.""- I did not.
- Yes, you did.It's regular hamburger.Take a bite. It's delicious.What's the matter?I'm gonna throw up.- No, you're not.
- It's yucky.It is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.Did you bring the chocolate chip
ice cream home?Yes, I brought the chocolate chip
ice cream home......and you can't have it until
you eat all your dinner...Where are you going?
Get back here now.Did you hear me?You'd better not do that.You'd better stop right there.
I'm warning you.Did you hear me?Now, you listen to me.
Don't be smart.Put that back until you finish
your dinner.If you take one bite out of that,
you're in trouble.Don't you dare.
Don't you dare do that.You hear me? Hold it right there.You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very big trouble.Don't you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down.I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.You're hurting me!Don't you kick me.- I hate you!
- You're no bargain either, pal.You are a spoiled little brat!- I hate you!
- I hate you back, you little shit!- I want my mommy!
- I'm all you've got.I want my mommy!I want my mommy!I want my mommy!Mommy...Daddy?Daddy?- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.I'm sorry too.I want you to go to sleep
because it's really late.Daddy?Now what is it?Are you going away?No.I'm staying here with you.
You can't get rid of me that easy.That's why Mommy left, isn't it?
Because I was bad?Is that what you think?No.That's not it, Billy.
Your mom loves you very much......and the reason she left has
nothing to do with you.I don't know if this will make sense,
but I'll try to explain it to you.I think the reason why Mommy left......was because for a long time......I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person.A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.And she just wasn't like that.
She was...She just wasn't like that.I think that she tried for so long
to make me happy......and when she couldn't,
she tried to talk to me about it.But I wasn't listening.
I was too busy, too wrapped up......just thinking about myself.And I thought that anytime
I was happy, she was happy.But I think underneath
she was very sad.Mommy stayed here longer than she
wanted because she loves you so much.And the reason why Mommy
couldn't stay anymore......was because she couldn't stand me.She didn't leave because of you.
She left because of me.Go to sleep now because
it's really late, okay?Good night.- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.See you in the morning light.- Daddy?
- Yeah?I love you.I love you too.- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen......welcome to our Halloween Pageant....welcome to our Halloween Pageant.- With gruesome goblins.
- With gruesome goblins.And ghostly ghosts.And wicked witches and spooky spooks.Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.Look, it doesn't make any difference.
It's name or likeness.I don't care. Tell them if they
want it, they have to pay for it.All right, bye-bye.Hello, Kramer.Can you check the copy
on Mid-Atlantic?I think it's okay.Yes.Yes, what?I'll have dinner with you.Thank you.You're welcome.Oh, shit!- I gotta go.
- What's the matter?I gotta go.- Want me to call a cab?
- No, I've got an 8:00 meeting.- Where you going?
- Bathroom.That's a closet.
Bathroom's over there.Yeah, you're right.These morons are violating the FTC
regulations, and I have to make sure...Hi.- What's your name?
- I'm Phyllis Bernard.Who?I'm a friend, uh, business associate
of your father's.Oh, Jesus.- Do you like fried chicken?
- Fried chicken? Very much.So do I.Well, it's really...It's nice seeing you and...- Bye.
- Bye.Kramer, I just met your son.Come on, you're never going to do
this if you don't concentrate.All right, come on. Thattaboy.
Get your centre.Okay? How's it feel?Good.Keep it going, keep it going!
That's terrific!Don't stop! Billy, keep your
feet moving!Oh, that's terrific.
How do you feel?- Good!
- You look great!Don't go too far!- Yeah?
- And so the dog really hurt Tom.So Tom got so mad, he jumped in
the potato salad......and he pushed over the table.Yeah?- Then...
- Let me get your shoelace.Then what happened?The big dog kept chasing him,
then he flipped the table.- With all the stuff coming down?
- Yeah.Then what happened?I don't want to be late for school.Here's your homework. Give me a kiss.- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.Taxi!Hi.Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.Tell me where you were.Well......my French professor finally
asked me out.- When?
- The other day.You had a date.I knew you were keeping
something from me!- I thought he was a pretty neat guy.
- Right.- So we go to dinner.
- Yeah?I find out he's married.He's deep in analysis.- He's telling me his life story...
- Wonderful!...and all I can think of
while I sit there......is that I'm paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour......to listen to his problems.Daddy! Daddy, look!- Take that out of your hand.
- I'll get him.Did you hear me?Hold it, hold it!It hurts, Daddy.- Daddy, hurry.
- Okay.- I can't see, Daddy.
- Rest your head.Watch it!Daddy, please hurry.- We're almost there.
- Can't see in my eye.Let me see.
Where's the emergency room?!How did this happen?He fell off the jungle gym.He had a plane in his hand.I'm just about through.- Don't hurt him.
- I won't hurt him.Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?Yeah. Can she come in?Margaret, come in.- Stay, Daddy.
- I'll be right back.- Daddy, stay.
- I'm just outside.It's all right, darling.I'm just talking to the doctor.He'll be right back.I'm right here.Will he lose his eye?No, but I have to take some stitches.How many?- About 10.
- What?Don't worry. There won't be
much of a scar.This will take about 15 minutes,
so step over here.I want to be in there with him.- You don't need to be in there.
- He's my son.If you're gonna do something,
I'm gonna be with him.Good boy. You're really brave.That was a big one.Stop it.Okay, we're almost done now.
We're almost done now.How is he?He's okay. He's sleeping.It's okay. I can do that.Ted, I'm so sorry.
I feel responsible.I don't know what happened.One minute he was there and the
next he was lying on the ground.Come on, Margaret.Now listen, I want
to ask you a favour, okay?It's a big favour.If something happened to me...
I'm not saying anything will......but if a building fell on me......would you consider
taking care of Billy?I want you to know that I put
some thought into this......and I......can't think of anybody else
I would trust with him.I know you'd be okay
with him because......you're a good mother.You're a lousy dishwasher.- All right?
- Okay.You're all right.Louise, you want to get that?Louise, it's ringing...
Yeah, hello.Yes, who is this?Joanna.Hi.- Hi.
- How are you?You look great.- How's your...?
- What?- I'm sorry.
- I was saying, how's your job?Fine. Vice president of nothing.No, really, it's great.- Would you like a drink?
- Whatever she has.- White wine.
- Wine.- How's Billy?
- He's terrific.He had a little accident in a
playground. He cut himself.It was scary.
I ran him to the hospital.He has a little scar,
but he'll be fine.I've been worrying
that it's my fault...Don't do that. You can't even
see it from a distance.I sit in the coffee shop across
from his school and watch him.He got so big.You've been watching him?I've been in New York for
about two months now.I didn't know that.Anyway...That's why I wanted
to talk to you today.Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad...- Shaky?
- Really bad shape.Yeah, I was.I was.Well, you look lovely now.- What?
- I have a whole speech.Go ahead.All my life I've felt like......somebody's wife or mother
or daughter.Even when we were together
I never knew who I was.That's why I had to go away.In California, I think I found myself.I got myself a job.I got myself a therapist,
a really good one.And I feel better about myself
than I ever have in my whole life.I learned a lot about myself.Such as?No, really, I'd really like to
know what you learned.I've learned
that I love my little boy.And that I'm capable of taking
care of him.What do you mean?I want my son.You can't have him.Don't get defensive. Don't bully me.I'm not getting defensive.Who walked out 15 months ago?I don't care. I'm still his mother.From 3000 miles away.Because you sent post cards gives
you the right to come back?I never stopped wanting him.What makes you sure he wants you?What makes you sure he doesn't?We're gonna sit here and
bat this back and forth.- It's like old times.
- You can't deny me...Don't tell me what I can or cannot do.- Don't talk to me that way.
- I anticipated this.Do what you have to.
I'll do what I have to.I'm sorry about this.Do what you have to do.I don't know the legal jargon for it,
but I think it's ""desertion. ""I don't mean to tell you your job,
but I have an open-and-shut case.There's no such thing as an open-and-
shut case where custody is involved.I'll bet your ex-wife
has already found a lawyer......who's advised her to move back
to establish residency.The burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.That means I'll have to play rough.
If I play rough......you can bet they will too.
Can you take that?Yes.And it's going to cost you $15,000.That's if we win.If we go to appeal,
it'll cost you more.I understand.Now, how old is the child again?My son is 7.- That's tough.
- Why?In cases involving a child that young,
the court tends to side with her.She signed over custody.I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
but it won't be easy.Do me a favour, will you?There's something I find useful
in matters like this.I sit down and I write out all
the pros and cons on an issue.Write them and look at them.- I want you to do that, okay?
- Okay.And after that......if you're really certain
you want to retain custody......then we'll go in there
and beat the pants off them. Okay?I love you, Billy. I know you're
sleeping and can't hear me.I love you with all my heart.Ted, you got a lunch?Hi, Jim. I don't know. I was trying
to work this idea out here...Good. I'll pick you up at 1:00.Okay, you got it.So the other morning,
I'm at the refrigerator......getting Billy ready for school.I'm just in my underwear
and he notices I've lost weight.He comes in and pats me.
He comes to here.And he says, "" Daddy, you've really
lost a lot of weight. ""He looks up at me and he says,
""And it's all gone to your nose. ""He was so cute. You know?You know, kids.It's delicious, want a taste?- I'm full.
- It's good.Listen, Ted......I had a call from a friend
of mine over at another agency.The Mid-Atlantic people have
invited them to pitch the account.Why?They're not happy
with what we're doing.I think you should have them over
and I'll give a little tap dance.I got Norman working on it.Norman?You taking me off the account?You don't like me anymore?It's not quite that simple.I think we're gonna have to
make a few changes here.You're firing me?Yeah, I'm letting you go, yes.Why?Now, look, Ted, this is
a very painful thing for me.I've been getting a lot of pressure
from the guys upstairs.There wasn't anything I could do.I think it's better this way.If I took your stripes......if I put you on a schlock account,
you'd hate it, and me for doing it.This way it's a clean break.
That's the best thing.You know my wife is fighting
for custody?You know that we're going to court?Do you know what my chances are
if I'm out of a job?I understand that you're upset...I don't want to beg, but I'm
asking you, please, as a friend.I'm asking you.You're an extremely bright guy.
You've got a hell of a talent.You're gonna land on your feet.
You're gonna survive.Teddy, look.I know you may be short on cash.No big hurry about paying this back.Shame on you.Daddy, the phone's ringing.- Mr. Kramer?
- Yes.- Hold on for Mr. Shaunessy.
- Ted.John. What's happening?They set the court date.
I just heard today it's January 9th.I gotta tell you something.
I got fired today. They laid me off.Yeah, I'm still here.
Ted, I won't lie to you.We don't have a hope of winning
if you're out of work.Yeah, listen, you tell that...You tell that party and you tell
that party's attorney......that I want a delay.Sorry, it's really too late.- Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours.
- How?I'll have a job in 24 hours.This is the worst time
to look for work.It's the holidays. We'll have
something for you by mid-February.- March, at the latest.
- I can't wait.Mr. Kramer, it's December 22.If you could just look
in your card catalogue.I'll take anything.There might be something
at Norman, Craig and Kummel.What is it?Something in the art department.You'd go back on the board.It's really a step down,
and a cut in salary of 5000.You'll be happier if you wait.Call them up, make an appointment
for me today at 4:00.It's the Friday before Christmas.It's still a workday.Nobody's gonna want to...Either you call them or I do.If I call them up, you don't get
a commission. Right?My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?Yes, we are.- Good afternoon.
- I'm Kramer. I have an appointment.I did all of the copy on that one.That was the most successful
ad campaign they ever had.I did the idea, the layout
and most of the copy on that one.Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.I'd like to get back to you.Is there someone I should see
before you come to your decision?Mr. Spencer, our creative director.Why don't you let me see him now?He's leaving on vacation. I'll set
something up the moment he gets back.- I think...
- Have a nice holiday.I'd like to see him before he leaves.- Mr. Kramer, I don't...
- I want this position very much.Wait here.Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.- How do you do?
- You got 10 minutes.You do understand that the salary is
$4800 less than you were making?Yes, I understand.Why are you interested in a position
for which you're overqualified?I need the job.Let me think. I'll let Jack know
and he'll get in touch with you.This is a one-day offer.You saw my book,
you know I can handle the work.You're gonna have to let me know today,
not at the end of the holidays.If you want me,
make a decision right now.Could we talk privately for a moment?Yes, sir.Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job.
Congratulations.Really?- Is he kidding?
- Welcome aboard.Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.Merry Christmas.Come on.- What do you think?
- It's neat.- I told you.
- Where is everybody?It's Saturday, so very few people
come in because it's a day off.Okay, push "" up. ""Push the top button.
Very top button.Go ahead, jump.- Look at that!
- Neat!You didn't know you were so high.What building is that?
That has the pointy top.That's the Chrysler.You proud of me?How'd you get this job?I told them I wanted it.
What's that say?It says "" Kramer. ""Kramer. Who's that?- That's us.
- That's right.You want to see?Wow!- This is neat.
- You like it?Careful, careful.- I'm okay.
- Scare me.What's that building?That's the U.N. building.
That's the East River.Look across there. You see that?That's Queens.
Look way, way down there.- Know what that is?
- What?- Brooklyn.
- Where you lived when you were a kid?That's right,
and this is where I work.Is this really your desk?Are you gonna get remarried?I hadn't thought about it.Are you gonna marry Phyllis?No, we're just good friends.Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?No, Mommy and me will never
be remarried.I bet if she saw this,
she'd remarry you.You're a con artist. We made a deal.You take a bath every night......and you wash that filthy hair
twice a week, right?- Right?
- Yeah.Okay.Promise, or you're not going.Did I have to
when Mommy was here?I don't care what you had
to do when Mommy...Did I, Dad? Did I?Are you listening?We'll talk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?Come here, give me a kiss.- What?
- You're a terrific kid.He says, ""There's the unicorn. ""And he goes underneath there,
and he says:"" Crumbs, what's happening?The air supply has stopped.Thundering typhoons,
what are you doing?"""" Resting. It's tiring work,
you know. ""What's the air supply?When you got two tanks on your back
and you can't get any air......you can drown,
so he's gotta have that.Ted, John Shaunessy.Hi, what's up?I got a call from your wife's lawyer.
She wants to see the kid.- She wants what?
- She's the mother.She's within her legal rights.- How do I know she won't kidnap him?
- I don't think she'd bother......suing if she's gonna kidnap him.Wait. I'm not so sure
about her mental health.- What do you mean?
- She said she was seeing a shrink.A psychiatrist.Did you see her talk to walls?I'm just saying, you know.I'm just saying you don't
have a choice.Have Billy at the boat pond
in Central Park, Saturday at 10.- Do I have to?
- Yes.Thanks very much.Daddy, will you come on
and finish the story?Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.What happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?When you die, there's bubbles
that come up or something.Where did I leave off?You left off right there.""Thundering typhoons... ""It's got an obstacle course and stuff.- The cars go really fast.
- How much?It's really neat.It's neat.- Come here, I want you to look...
- Okay, okay.I'll have him back by 6.You got so handsome.Remember, we talked about it,
keep your answers short and succinct.Just tell the truth and it'll be
all right. Believe me.- She's here.
- Yeah, I know. I saw her.Whatever you do, try not to become
emotional, no matter what he says.You'll hear things that may upset you.
I don't want you to react.Persons having business with the
Supreme Court, State of New York......special term part five,
draw nigh and ye shall be heard.This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.- Is the petitioner's attorney ready?
- I am, Your Honour.I would like to call Joanna Kramer.Motherhood, going for the throat.You swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?I do.Now, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell
the court how long you were married?Eight years.And would you describe those years
as happy?The first two, yes.But after that it became
increasingly difficult.Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job
before you were married?Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith......I worked in the art department of
Mademoiselle magazine for years.Did you continue to work
after you were married?No. I did not.Did you wish to?Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...To my ex-husband about it,
he wouldn't listen.He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.He said that I
probably couldn't get a job......that would pay enough
to hire a babysitter.Tell me, are you employed
at the present time?I'm a sportswear designer
here in New York.And what is your present salary?I make $31,000 a year.Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?Yes, I do, very much.And yet you chose to leave him.Yes.During the last five years
of our marriage......I was becoming more
and more unhappy.More and more troubled.And I really needed
somebody to help me......but when I turned to Ted, he just......wasn't there for me.So we became more isolated
from one another......more and more separate.He was very involved in his career.And because of his attitude
towards my fears......and his inability
to deal with my feelings......I had come to have
almost no self-esteem.I was scared and I was very unhappy.In my mind I had no choice
but to leave.At the time I left, I felt that
there was something wrong with me......and that my son would be
better off without me.And it was only after I got
to California that I realized......after getting into therapy,
that I wasn't a terrible person.And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotional outlet......other than my child,
that didn't make me unfit.I would like to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist......Dr. Eleanor Freedman.Objection, Your Honour.The report is irrelevant
and not binding on the respondent.Overruled.Can you tell the court why
you are asking for custody?Because he's my child......and because I love him.I know I left my son.I know that
that's a terrible thing to do.Believe me, I have to live with that
every day of my life.But in order to leave him......I had to believe it was
the only thing I could do......and that it was
the best thing for him.I was incapable of functioning
in that home.And I didn't know......what the alternative was......so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.However, I have since
gotten some help......and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whole human being.I don't think I should be
punished for that.I don't think my little boy
should be punished.Billy's only 7 years old.He needs me.I'm not saying he doesn't
need his father......but I really believe
he needs me more.I was his mommy
for five and a half years......and Ted took over that role
for 18 months.But I don't know how anybody
can possibly believe......that I have less of a stake
in mothering that little boy......than Mr. Kramer does.I'm his mother.I'm his mother.Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.I have no further questions.Now then, Mrs. Kramer......you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?In all that time did your husband ever
strike you or physically abuse you?No.Did he ever strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?Would you describe your husband
as an alcoholic?A heavy drinker?Was he unfaithful?Did he ever fail
to provide for you in any way?I can certainly see why you left him.Objection.How long do you plan to live
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?Permanently.How many boyfriends have you had,
permanently?Objection on grounds of vagueness.I'll allow it.I don't recall.More than three, less than 33,
permanently?- Objection.
- Overruled.The witness will answer, please.Somewhere in between.Do you have a lover now?Your Honour, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question.Does she have a lover?I'll allow that.
The witness will answer, please.Yes, I'm seeing someone now.Is that... permanent?I don't know.We don't know
when you say permanently......if you plan to live in New York,
or keep your child, for that matter......since you've never done anything
that could be regarded as permanent.Objection. I request the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.Sustained.I'll put it another way, counsellor.What was the longest personal
relationship in your life......outside of parents or girlfriends?I suppose that would be my child.Whom you've seen twice in a year.Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband......wasn't he the longest
personal relationship in your life?Would you speak up?
I couldn't hear you.Yes.How long was that?We were married a year
before the baby......and seven years after.So you were a failure at the most
important relationship in your life.- Objection.
- Overruled.The witness's opinion on this
is relevant.I was not a failure.What do you call it, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.I consider it less my failure
than his.Congratulations.You've just rewritten matrimonial law.
You were both divorced.Objection!Your Honour, I would like to ask
what this model of stability......and respectability
has ever succeeded at.Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?- It did not succeed.
- Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?Were you?!No.Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?No further questions.- Did you have to be so rough?
- Do you want the kid?Daddy?Daddy.- Yeah?
- What did you do when you were little?The same things you do.Did you watch The Brady Bunch?No, we didn't have any television.You didn't?We listened to the radio.What else didn't you have?We didn't have lots of things.- Like?
- Like a lot of things.What kind?Come here.We didn't have diet soda.We had egg creams, which was
chocolate syrup......seltzer water and a bit of
milk and you went......and you drank it
and it was delicious.We didn't have the Mets,
but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.We had the Polo Grounds
and Ebbets Field...Boy, those were the days.We didn't have the Volkswagens......but we had all those different cars
with funny names on them.We didn't have Burger King
or McDonald's.We had automats where you put a
quarter in and you'd get......a piece of pie or a sandwich
you could see through a window.We didn't have graffiti,
but we had this guy Kilroy...Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.He spends a great deal of time
with Billy.He reads to Billy a lot.They play together,
they talk all the time.He's a wonderful father.Thank you.
No further questions.Mrs. Phelps, how long
have you known Joanna Kramer?About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the building.How often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?I haven't seen them together now for
about a year and a half, but......back then I saw them two or
three times a week.My oldest daughter and Billy
play together.Can you describe the relationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?It was good.Joanna was a very good mother.Both Ted and Joanna are very...Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her
relationship with her ex-husband?Yes.Can you tell the court
exactly what she said?Joanna wasn't happy for many reasons...Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son's needs?Would you answer the question?- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, but that was before...Did you ever encourage
her to leave her husband?No, I did not.Several days before she left,
did you say to her:"" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave""?- I didn't think Joanna...
- Did you say to her:"" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave""?- Yes, but she was my friend...
- No further questions.Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.Joanna, things are not the same now.Ted is not the same man.- You don't know how hard he's tried...
- Mrs. Phelps!They're beautiful together.The witness is asked to step down.If you could see them together......maybe you wouldn't be here now.Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!I'm sorry.When you were talking...When my ex-wife was talking about how
unhappy she was during our marriage......most of what she said
was probably true.There's a lot I didn't understand.There's a lot
I'd do different if I could......just like there's a lot you wish
you could change but can't.Some things, once they're done,
can't be undone.My wife...My ex-wife says she loves Billy
and I believe she does.But I don't think
that's the issue here.If I understand it correctly......what means the most here is
what's best for our son.What's best for Billy.My wife used to say to me:""Why can't a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?""I think you're right.And maybe I've learned that much.By the same token, I'd like to know......what law says a woman is a better
parent simply by virtue of her sex?I've had time to think about
what makes a good parent.It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience......listening to him......or pretending to listen
when you can't anymore.It has to do with love,
like she was saying.I don't know where it says a woman
has a corner on that market......that a man has any less
of those emotions than a woman.Billy has a home with me.
I've made it the best I could.It's not perfect.
I'm not a perfect parent.Sometimes I don't have enough patience
and I forget that he's a little kid.But I'm there.We eat breakfast and he talks to me,
and then we go to school.At night we have dinner together and
we talk and I read to him and...And we built a life together
and we love each other.If you destroy that......it may be irreparable.Joanna, don't do that, please.- Don't do it twice to him.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramer.No further questions.How long have you
worked in advertising?Ever since I graduated high school.College, I mean.
I've been there about 15 years.Would you say you've achieved a
certain status in your profession?Yes, I have a good reputation.When you worked at Roth, Kane
and Donovan, what was your salary?Around $33,000 dollars a year
when I left.Now you work at Norman, Craig
and Kummel?- Yes.
- What is your salary?It's almost 29,000.Could you be more specific?I make $28,200.28,200.You're the only person who's working
his way down the ladder of success.Objection. Your Honour, I ask that
counsel's last remark be stricken.Sustained.Is it true you were fired
from your previous job?- I was let go.
- Will you tell us why you were let go?There was a difference
of opinion in policy.Is it true your agency lost a major
account due to your negligence?Objection!I'm trying to establish
the witness's employment record.He cannot hold a job.I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.It's not unusual in advertising
for a client......to change his mind
and go elsewhere...Was it true you walked out on a
client during a major presentation......saying that you had an appointment
with a teacher?My son was sitting next to a kid
who was hitting and biting.- Yes or no?
- Yes, but he bit my kid.Last spring, did you miss a deadline
on the Mid-Atlantic account......causing your company a
great deal of embarrassment......and considerable
financial liability?On that day I had to go home
because my child was sick.Did you or did you not
miss a deadline?- My son was sick.
- Answer the question.I'm trying to answer the question.
It's not yes or no.- Yes or no?
- He had a 104 temperature!He's lying there sweating!
I go home to him!Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.I missed the deadline.- Do you have a violent temper?
- No.- Objection.
- I withdraw the question.- Do you consider yourself a fit parent?
- Yes, I do.Is it true your child nearly lost
an eye while in your care?- Objection.
- Overruled.Answer the question.He was in the playground,
on the jungle gym...And fell and nearly lost an eye
while in your care.He fell and cut himself.Is it true you told your ex-wife......you were responsible for the
injury that disfigured your child?Did you tell her:""When it happened I felt guilty.
I felt it was my fault""?- Objection!
- I have concluded my questions.Ted?Ted?I'm sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago......and I never thought he would
bring it up, never.Believe me.I never would have mentioned it if
I thought he'd pull a thing like that.I'm sorry.I'm...Ted.- Hi.
- Hi. Here, let me help you.Heard anything yet?Any day. My lawyer says
no news is good news.- Guess what.
- What?Charley and I are talking about
getting back together.Really?
Did he finally call you?No, I called him.How come?I don't know. I got to thinking
about a lot of things since the trial.And...I don't think it'll work out,
but he seems to want it.That's terrific.
How do you feel?I don't know.
I feel scared, I guess.- Hi.
- Hi.I lost.I can't tell you how sorry I am.What happened?The judge went for motherhood
right down the line.""Ordered and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody......effective Monday,
the 23rd of January......that the respondent pay for the
support of the child, $400 a month.The father shall have the
following visitation rights:Every other weekend, one night a
week to be mutually agreed upon......and one half of the child's
vacation period. ""- That's it.
- What if I fight it?I can't guarantee anything.I'll take my chances.- It'll cost you.
- I'll pay anything.Look, Ted, I have to
tell you something.This time it'll be Billy that pays.I'll have to put him on the stand.I can't do that.No, I don't want to do that.Thanks very much for your time.
I'm gonna take a walk.Ted? It's me.Ted?I just heard.Please go away.Are you okay?I just have to be by myself
for a while, Margaret.I don't understand.The problem is your mom and I
both want you to live with us.So that's why we decided to go see
this man, who is the judge......and we let him decide because
he's very wise and experienced.We talked to him for a few days
and then asked what he thought.You know what?
He agreed with Mommy.He thought it'd be terrific
if you lived with her from now on.I'm lucky because I get to have
dinner with you once a week.And twice a month
we spend the weekends together.Where's my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sleep?Mommy's figured that all out. You
have your own bedroom at her place.- Where will all my toys be?
- At Mommy's.We're gonna take
all your toys over there.If you play your cards right,
she'll buy you some new ones.Who's gonna read me
my bedtime stories?Mommy will.You're not gonna kiss me
good night anymore?No, I won't be able to do that.But, you know, I get to visit.It's gonna be okay. Really.If I don't like it, can I come home?What do you mean?You'll have a great time with Mommy.Really. She loves you so much.Dad?Don't forget, once, if you can
just call me up, okay?We're gonna be okay.Let's go get some ice cream.Come on, let's get
this show on the road.Let's get a little hustle now, okay?Come on, set the table.Come on.Are you ready?Yes?It's Joanna.
I'm downstairs in the lobby.Can you come down here
and meet me alone?Hi.What's up?Tell me. What?
What's the matter?I woke up this morning.Kept thinking about Billy......and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room......with his little clouds
all around that I painted......and I thought I should have
painted clouds downtown because......then he would think that
he was waking up at home.I came here to take my son home.And I realized he already is home.I love him very much.I'm not gonna take him with me.Can I go up and talk to him?Yeah.Why don't you go upstairs
and see him and I'll wait here.How do I look?Terrific."
Rain Man|1988|90|Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Valeria Golino, Gerald R. Molen|Barry Levinson|"RAIN MANI've got four Lamborghinis
that can't meet smog emission standards.How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.Three times?
You're on a roll.Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.I'll explain that
to my swing loan.I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.I got a shark snappin' at my heels.They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my four cars off the road?Babbitt Collectibles.Have you tried cash?
How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing Loan.If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.I need this.
Come on.I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.His number?
He's on the road now.- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:30 a.m.- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...and the E.P.A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm Listening.Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Line.As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.And because of your
incredible patience...we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.Well, yes,
you've been most patient.We really appreciate your patience.
Well, thank you.Thank you.Ready for Palm Springs?You still want to go
with all these problems?We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- No, not bad at all.- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.I got it under control.I don't want to be demanding...but could you possibly say 10 or
12 words before we get to the hotel?Consider it foreplay.Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--You wanna talk?
Let's talk!This is not talking.- Yeah?
- Charlie, this is Lenny.I've been trying to contact you
for a while.I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.He's been trying to reach you.Your father has died, Charlie.I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.Anything else?- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?I told you before,
we had a falling-out a Long time ago.My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.We just didn't get along.- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.I want to.All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to....to our beloved neighbor...for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for Life...dedication to family...and charity to all.And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection Life...we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.I can wait in the car.Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.Knew this car my whole Life.
Only drove it once.A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.Know it by rote.You were his only child.You came along when he was...what, 45 or something?He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...so he had to love you.I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.In these pictures here, he doesn't look
Like a man who doesn't love his son.What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...I bring home a report card,
and it's almost all A's.I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?Because l--
I deserved it.Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.- We get pulled over.
- An accident?Pulled over.- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?Two days.Were you scared?Yeah, I was scared.Left home.
I never saw him again.Charlie, after a year
we've been together...this is the first time
I've heard this story.It's strange, huh?I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.The rain what?You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.Not so much.'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.So full of yourself.And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...is understandable as well.Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...all these I forgive.But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my Life in any way...has left me without a son.I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.''l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...that certain Buick convertible...the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.May they remind him
of the value of excellence...and the possibility of perfection.As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'What does that mean?It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.What is that?
How does that work?Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?What's his name got--- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.I definitely got
the rose bushes.- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.- There's no need--
- To what?To be upset?To be upset?If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?- Were you Listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.Were you?No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.I was looking for you.How did it go?I got what I expected.Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.- Can I help you?
- I think you can.I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.Is this Wallbrook?Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?Excuse me.Dr. Bruner is still in conference.Would you Like
to wait in his office?No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.I'd Like to watch
the TV, please.For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?I knew your father
since you were two years old.The year my mother died.I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.Maybe that's something
we could discuss.I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.And you think
I should feel that loyalty?I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...by a man who had
difficulty showing love.And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...help me understand
the right in what he's done.Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.I'm sorry,
this is not your car.Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.Of course, today's Monday.I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.Now they're pitiful red.You know, these seats
were brown leather.- You know this car?
- I know this car.- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.Only 8,095 production models.Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'I wanna ask you a question.What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.Bruner, who is this guy?Raymond is your brother.My brother?
I don't have a brother....and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:'The People's Court.''The People's Court.''The People's Court.'Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'- What is he, crazy?
- No.- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.I don't know what that means.People Like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...and how it's processed.English here.
You're talkin' over my head.Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.He can't even express himself
or probably even...understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.Rituals. That's a good one.Well, it's the way he acts...sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How Long has he been here?- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.- You've been here that Long?
- That's when I started.So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?I don't know.Does he know how much money
he's been left?No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.He doesn't understand
the concept of money.He's just inherited $3 million...and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?Good ol' Dad.What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?Why is he doin' that?Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'- Yeah, why?
- Why?It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.- Ted Kloszevski.
- Kluszewski.Ted Kluszewski. 'Big Klu.'
First base.- He played for Cincinnati.
- Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.- Lifetime batting average, .298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people
are gonna be here all day, Vern.This is an unannounced visit, Vern.-This is definitely not a weekend visit.
-He's gettin' anxious.- It's okay, Ray.
- Vern.This is an unannounced visit, Vern.- He said not to touch the books!
- Not to touch books.- You Like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?- Stop it!
- Yes.You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?- I don't know.
- You don't know?Maybe you'd better put it back.You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.I won't touch anything else, Ray.It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.It's okay, Ray.- My main man.
- My main man.Here are your cards. I didn't know
where you wanted me to put them.Are you taking any
prescription medication?That's his way of showing he likes you.But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.If I left town tomorrow and
didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.He wouldn't notice?I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.Ray, you wanna go take a walk?Can he hear us
when he's Like that?You wanna show
your brother your ducks?There's 27 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'Don't worry.
We'll bring you right back.Practically 26 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'- We'll bring him right back.
- Twenty-six minutes.I won't do it.First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--You're upset. Raymond,
I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.No. Just stay there.Just stay there.
Just stand still, okay? That's good.I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do--What?Why do I have to take the car
and go down there...and wait for you again
at the gate?- Why?
- It's for Raymond.The car disturbs him.- That's why?
- That's why.Okay, Raymond.What are you lookin' at?
The ducks are over here.I don't know.Listen, our father died last week.- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.- Go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.- We don't have to go today.
- Monday, no games scheduled.I just thought maybe you'd Like
to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.He pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.Come on, Ray.It's a Long way
to California...and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.Have to be back in two hours.The people, crowds cheering.
You'll love it.- This is the presidential suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.Here is Raymond's room.- Look at this beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.Little guy! This is gonna be terrific.
We're brothers.- Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.
- When did he say--I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have that for dessert.We can do that.
I'm gonna call Lenny.This is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.- The bed's in the wrong place.
- You can move it.- Where do you want the bed?
- Should be near the window.Of course, I don't have my books.
Of course, there's no bookshelves.I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be book-less.Here's a book, a big telephone book.
A lot of words.Pick up, Lenny.I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,
and he doesn't answer the phone.- 6:00 here means it's 9:00 there.
- It's 3:00 there.6:30 p.m. is dinner.It's 3:00 there.
He doesn't wanna answer the phone?Orange soda.Has to be in a can with a straw.Bruner told you
that you should do this?- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.V-E-R-N!Oh, God.
Go see what he's doin'.- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?Everything is fine.
Charlie, let's take him home.He's okay.
Just get him some dinner.Did you say you wanted hamburger?Hamburger, Ray?- We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.
- Pizza?- You get pizza in the institution?
- Monday night's Italian night.- Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu.- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- I've got a bit of a legal problem.He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. We're allowed.'Wheel of Fortune'!Look at this studio filled with
glamorous merchandise...fabulous and exciting
bonus prizes.A pair of cars for today's busy couple.Thousands of dollars in cash.Over $150,000
just waiting to be won...as we present
our big bonanza of cash...on 'Wheel Of Fortune'!I'd Like to order a large pizza.
Pepperoni, right?I don't want pepperoni.Yeah, a large pepperoni.
How Long is that gonna take?Bring some beer up and orange soda.
You got tapioca pudding?- No, sir, we don't.
- Just bring the closest thing.Ray, take this.
Food is coming shortly.I'll be right back.Of course, I'm gonna be here
for a Long time, a very Long time.I'm gone for good,
gone for good from my home.- Si! Si!
- Si.What is that?I think Raymond is in the room.- Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie Babbitt.Well, get out!
Get out!- Go!
- Stop it.- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.Go in there.Raymond, what were you doin' in my room?
What were you doin' in my room?- I don't know.
- You don't know what you were doin'?-Of course, there were noises.
-Those noises are none of your business.You understand that?Stop actin' Like an idiot
and go to sleep.Did you hear what I said?
Go to sleep!- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11:00.- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.You don't listen to me.- What are you talkin' about?
- I asked you to apologize.- You went there and insulted him again.
- I'm not his mother.Charlie, you're his brother!They tell you today
that you have a brother...and I don't see in your face
one little reaction.- I'm not saying joy.
- You don't know what I'm goin' through.What are you going through?
Because I don't know.You don't tell me anything.- You just give me lies!
- What lies?This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.I know it's not true.
So tell me, why is he here?- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?- 'Cause I got him and they want him!
- This makes no sense!- Raymond was left all the money.
- How much?- $3 million. Every penny of it.
- So?I'm gonna keep him
'til I get my half!What is this, huh?
Susanna?- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.- What does that mean?
- I'm leaving.You're leaving me now?
I need you!You need nobody.What does that mean?Just take it easy!
What is my crime here?Your crime is
that you use people!- You're using Raymond, you're using me.
- I'm using Raymond?Raymond, am I using you?Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half hour ago!What good is $3 million to him?That money is only gonna sit there,
and I need that money.You need it, so it's not Like stealing.
And then what happens to Raymond?He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or I'll put him in a better place.- He is gonna be just the same.
- Only you have his money.His money? That man was my father too.
Where's my fuckin' half?- I'm entitled to that money!
- You kidnapped this man!I did not take him.
I took my half.- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.You're soaking wet and you're gonna

little things, sometimes.Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.Did you memorize the whole book?- How far did you get?
- 'G.''G.' Gottsaken, William Marshall.- You memorized to 'G'?
- Yeah, 'G.'- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of 'G.'That's good, Ray.
I Like that.- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.They got pancakes.- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.You don't need toothpicks.That was okay in the hotel with pizza,
but in a restaurant you use a fork.- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.The pancakes
will keep sliding off.I don't have my maple syrup either.
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.You don't see any pancakes,
do you?Of course,
maple syrup is not here.Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.We haven't ordered yet.Maple syrup after the pancakes
is definitely too late.How is that gonna be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.If we're gonna be here all morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...I'm definitely not gonna
have my pancakes with--Don't make a scene.Stop actin' Like a fuckin' retard.What are you writing?What the fuck is this?'Serious'-- 'Serious injury list:
Charlie Babbitt'?'Serious injury list'?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?Number 18 in 1988.Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988.'Squeezed and pulled and hurt
your neck in 1988'?Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.Where are you, son?That's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.You have to bring him back,
Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?No problem.That will be $1.5 million.
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.Don't touch that.I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.He belongs here.I'm his brother.
It's not Like kidnapping here, is it?He's always been a voluntary patient
here, but that's beside the point.This is where he can get
the best care.We're talking about his well-being.Yeah. Let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.If you won't cut a deal with me,
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...I'll stick him in an institution
out there...and we can have
a custody battle over him.Miss, he needs toothpicks.Could you get him some?
Thank you.Now, you wanna battle me
in the courts?You think about that, Dr. Bruner.
Think about that.Or we can cut a deal right now.I don't think you have any idea
of the severity of Raymond's condition.Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.Can we just get him
some toothpicks?I cannot make
money deals with you.Then I'll see you in court.Can I have the check?

Do you understand that?- My Loan is past due.

a date for the custody hearing.Stu, I want a firm date,

what you're doing to Raymond.- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.He's in Las Vegas in a suit
in a big room. It makes me sad.Six minutes to my date.Six minutes to Iris.He has a date?Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that television everywhere we go.Why do you have to bring
a Watchman on your date?A man's dancing.But what does your date
look Like, Raymond?She's very sparkly.
She looks Like a holiday.- I haven't heard that one before.
- Mr. Babbitt?- Mr. Kelso would Like to see you.
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.He's director of security.
Would you come with me, please?Sure. Susanna,
you stay with Raymond.- Right this way.
- Certainly.10:01, she's not here.She'll come. She will.Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.I don't understand
what you're talking about.We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we analyze the tapes...and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.These tapes suggest that you should
take your winnings and Leave the state.Someone has a good day
at the tables...and you accuse them
of illegal activities?Is this how you treat
all your guests?All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.Those are the best odds you're
gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.- Did you want to dance on your date?
- Yeah.There'll be other chances. Many pretty
girls would love to dance with you.- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.- I Like this music, Ray.
- Elevator stopped.It's okay. You think you could show me
how you were going to dance with Iris?- Yeah.
- Yes?- Would you Like to dance with me?
- Elevator's on hold.- Give me this.
- Yeah.- Yeah.
- Show me how.Charlie Babbitt taught me.- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.Dancing in the elevator.It's nice.You're very good.- Iris missed a beautiful dance.
- Yeah.- And a kiss.
- Yeah, a kiss.- Have you ever kissed a girl?
- I don't know.You don't know?Open your mouth. Open.- Yeah.
- Like this.Like you were tasting
something very good...and very soft.Like this.
Close your eyes.- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.- How was that?
- Wet.- Then we did it right.
- Elevator's definitely stuck.No, it's not stuck.Here.Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.- Like us.
- Yeah, Like us.What'd I tell you, Ray?
I promised you could drive.- At Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway.
- Charlie, this is okay?- I'm an excellent driver.
- He's good on a driveway.Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?So, I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.- Yeah. I'm nervous.
- I know.Listen, I'm glad, happy--
I'm happy that you came to Vegas.I know.Ciao.Ray, thank you for the date
in the elevator. It was really nice.- Yeah.
- Ciao.- Thank you for the what?
- It's something between us.- Between us?
- Us.Us, Ray?Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.Of course, there's
definitely no bed there.No, this is a magic bed, Ray.
You just watch and see.We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.Went to the video store.
Got a surprise for you, Ray.Picked up a video for you.Don't start with that, Ray.It's not just another place, Ray.
This is my place.I'm asking you who's on first.
That's the man's name.Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.You got a first baseman on first?
Certainly. Then who's playing first?- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?Yes.- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.- Whose wife?
- Yes.- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?Absolutely.All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?No, What is on second base.- Don't you think this is funny?
- Yes, it's funny.- Where'd you see this first?
- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.- Dad, huh?
- Yeah.- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.
I'd Like you to call me.Yeah, what is it?I thought I got the machine.I just got into town, and the
psychological interview is tomorrow.Yes, sir, I know that.I thought we should
get together and talk.I think it might be in your
best interests to meet me.When?I'm at the Bonaventure.
How about tonight at 8:30?Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,
who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.- Yeah, I know.
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.- Good luck.
- This isn't a close call.It's a formality. Your brother's
a very disabled individual.Are you trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?No, I'm telling you
it's always been a lost cause.- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.Your father put me in charge
of all the money.It doesn't matter whether or not
you win custody of Raymond.I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion.- So you can't lose?
- I can lose Raymond.I care about your brother's Life
and the treatment he receives.I made a commitment to your father
some 20 years ago...and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.What is this?It's a very big check.$250,000.And no strings attached.
Just walk away, Charlie.This isn't about you and me.It's not about winning or losing.I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?You didn't have an answer.I don't know.I just realized
I'm not pissed off anymore...my father cut me out of his will.You probably knew he tried
to contact me over the years.I never called him back.
I was a prick.If he was my son and didn't return
my calls, I'd have written him out.But it's not about
the money anymore.You know,
I just don't understand.Why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?Why didn't anyone ever tell me
that I had a brother?Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.Ray! Come on.It stopped.
It's all right.V-E-R-N.Vern. Vern.My main man, Vern.V-E-R-N.My main man, Vern.V-E-R-N.
Vern, my main man.They got raspberry, blueberry...whole wheat, peachy keen,
beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.How about buckwheat?
What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?- Pancakes.
- What kind?- Pancakes.
- Of course.The maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pan--Charlie Babbitt made a joke.- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.Step back a little bit.Hello?Why don't you go
sit down over there?Hello?This is not a legal proceeding,
so there's no judge present...just the people
who care about Raymond.Raymond, have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.Raymond, right here.
How about this seat?- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.Ray, the TV?
On the floor. I'm sorry.I don't know an easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--Have I lost already?No, you haven't lost.
I'm not the judge and jury.I'm just making
a recommendation to a court.I must tell you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professional.Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years...and Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.You've made up your mind.
I'll see you in court.My brother came further with me
than he did with you in 20 years.- It's not necessary to--
- You don't know anything about us.- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.Raymond, what happened
this past week?- What did you do?
- Counted cards.- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.Danced in the elevator with Susanna.
Kissed Susanna.- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.- Wet?
- Yeah.- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.- You drove?
- Yeah.-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.He didn't drive on the highway.- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?Well, things they tend to do when--
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?- This morning when--
- This morning?This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.He got nervous,
but he's fine now.Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.I'm not placing any blame--I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?No one is saying anything.I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.- This is my family.
- I understand that.Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.There's some things
I'd Like to go over.Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?My father died.
I was upset.That was wrong.Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...and you want to
take care of him.Yes.From the beginning
it was Like a kidnapping.Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.Yes.- Look, that--
- Yes?I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.When it started out--- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.There's no accusations.
Go ahead.No accusations?See, you have to understand...that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...in name.And then...this morning we had pancakes.Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--Maple syrup on the table.And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.See, we--I made a connection.I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.I'm all for that.- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.He can't decide for himself.He's capable
of a lot more than you know.Why don't we ask Raymond?Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?Do you wanna stay
with your brother?Raymond, would you Like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?The doctor's asking you a question.- So you listen.
- Yeah.Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.- You do?
- Yeah.You wanna stay with your brother?Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.- That's what you want?
- Yeah.- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?Yeah.- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.They're two separate things.Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.All right.Just hold on here.All right.All right.
You made your point.You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.- It's over.
- Yeah.Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.- Raymond?
- Yeah.Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?Excuse me.- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.I don't know.- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.- What?
- My main man.Listen.Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.Because you see, these--Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.- You know?
- Yeah.What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.Connecting.- I Like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.Yes, you are.I Like having you
for my big brother.C-H-A-R-L-l-E.C-H-A-R-L-l-E.Main man.May I have your attention, please?Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound...now boarding, track number three.- Fullerton, San Bernardino, Barstow...
- Ray.Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.- Hello, Charlie.
- Dr. Bruner.Hello, Raymond.Wouldn't you feel more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?Tell him, Ray.- Kmart sucks.
- I see.I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.Why don't you take a couple of minutes?
See you, Charlie.You made a joke, Ray.I guess I'd better give this to you.
You're gonna have to carry this now.It's got your cheeseballs,
your apple juice...notebooks, pens and...'Who's On First?' video
that you Like.- 'Who's On First?' is very funny.
- I told you it's funny.Board!- Better get goin'.
- Very shiny train.Yeah, it sure is.Now listen, Ray.
Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.That doesn't mean I can't visit.I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.- How many days is that?
- Fourteen days from today.- Today's Wednesday.
- And hours?336 hours.Mystifying.'Course, that's 20,160 minutes.1,209,600 seconds.Ray?I'll see you soon.Yeah.
One for bad, two for good.Bet two for good.Three minutes to Wapner.You'll make it."

upon your hour.'Tis now struck twelve -
get thee to bed, Francisco.For this relief much thanks.'Tis bitter cold,
and I am sick at heart.Have you had quiet guard?Not a mouse stirring.Well, good night.Stand, ho! Who's there?
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.Give you good night.
Farewell, honest soldier.Who hath relieved you?Bernardo has my place.Give you good night.Holla! Bernardo!Say, what, is Horatio there?A piece of him. Welcome, Horatio,
welcome, good Marcellus.What, has this thing
appeared again tonight?I have seen nothing.Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,and will not let belief
take hold of him.Touching this dreaded sight,
twice seen of us.Therefore I have entreated him
along with usto watch the minutes of this night,that if again the apparition come,he may approve our eyes
and speak to it.Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.Then let us once again
assail your ears,that are so fortified
against our storywhat we have two nights seen.Well, let us hear Bernardo
speak of this.Last night of all,when yond same star
that's westward from the polehad made his course to illume
that part of heavenwhere now it burns,
Marcellus and myself,the bell then beating one...Peace! Break thee off.Look, where it comes again!In the same figure,
like the king that's dead.Thou art a scholar -
speak to it, Horatio.Looks it not like the king?
Mark it, Horatio.Most like, it harrows me with fear
and wonder. It would be spoke to.Question it, Horatio.What art thou
that usurp'st this time of night,together with that
fair and warlike formin which the majesty of buried
Denmark did sometimes march?By heaven I charge thee, speak!It is offended. See, it stalks away!Stay! Speak, speak!
I charge thee, speak!'Tis gone,and will not answer.Before my God,
I might not this believewithout the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes.Thus twice before,
and jump at this dead hour,with martial stalk
hath he gone by our watch.In what particular
thought to work I know not,but in the gross and scope
of my opinion,this bodes some strange eruption
to our state.Good now, stand close,
and tell me, he that knows,why this same strict
and most observant watchso nightly toils
the subject of the land,and why such daily cast
of brazen cannonand foreign mart
for implements of war.What might be toward,
that this sweaty hastedoth make the night
joint-labourer with the day?Who is't that can inform me?That can I -at least, the whisper goes so.Our last king,whose image
even but now appear'd to us,Was, as you know,
by Fortinbras of Norwaydared to the combat,
in which our valiant Hamletdid slay this Fortinbras, who thusdid forfeit, with his life,
all these his lands.Now, sir, young Fortinbras,of unimproved mettle hot and full,hath in the skirts of Norway
here and thereshark'd up a list
of lawless resolutes,to recover of us
those foresaid landsso by his father lost.
And this, I take it,is the main motive
of our preparations,the source of this our watch
and the chief headof this post-haste
and romage in the land.But soft, behold!
lo, where it comes again!I'll cross it, though it blast me.
Stay, illusion!If thou hast any sound,
or use of voice, speak to me.If thou art privy
to thy country's fate,which, happily,
foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!COCK CROWSStay, and speak!Stop it, Marcellus.Shall I strike at it?
Do, if it will not stand.'Tis here! 'Tis here!'Tis gone!We do it wrong, being so majestical,to offer it the show of violence.For it is, as is the air,
invulnerable,and our vain blows
malicious mockery.It was about to speak,
when the cock crew.And then it started
like a guilty thingupon a fearful summons.It faded on the crowing of the cock.Some say that ever
'gainst that season comeswherein our Saviour's birth
is celebrated,the bird of dawning singeth
all night longand then, they say,
no spirit dares stir abroad.The nights are wholesome,
then no planets strike,no fairy takes,
nor witch hath power to charm,so hallow'd and so gracious
is the time.So have I heard
and do in part believe it.But, look -
the morn, in russet mantle clad,walks o'er the dew
of yond high eastward hill.Break we our watch up,
and by my advice,let us impart
what we have seen tonightunto young Hamlet,
for, upon my life,this spirit, dumb to us,
will speak to him.Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's deaththe memory be green...And that it us befittedto bear our hearts in grief
and our whole kingdomto be contracted
in one brow of woe.Yet so far hath discretion
fought with naturethat we with wisest sorrow
think on him,together with remembrance
of ourselves.Therefore our sometime sister,
and our queen,the imperial jointress
to this warlike state,have we,
as 'twere with a defeated joy,with one auspicious
and one dropping eye,with mirth in funeral
and with dirge in marriage,in equal scale weighing delight
and dole,taken to wife.APPLAUSENor have we herein barr'dyour better wisdoms,
which have freely gonewith this affair along.
For all, our thanks.Now follows, that you know,
young Fortinbras,holding a weak supposal
of our worth,or thinking by our late
dear brother's deathour state to be disjoint
and out of frame,he hath not fail'd
to pester us with message,importing the surrender
of those landslost by his father,
with all bonds of law,to our most valiant brother.So much for him.Thus much the business is.We have here writWe have here writTo Norway,
uncle of young Fortinbras,that he suppress
his nephew's further marchand threatening enterprise
against our state.And we here dispatch you,
good Cornelia,and Voltimand as our ambassadors
to old Norway.In that and in all things
we show our duty.We doubt it nothing.
Heartily farewell.And now, Laertes,
what's the news with you?You told us of some suit -
what is't, Laertes?LAUGHTERYou cannot speak of reason
to the Daneand lose your voice.My dread lord,your leave and favour
to return to France,from whence though willingly
I came to Denmark,to show my duty in your coronation,yet now, I must confess,
that duty done,ny thoughts and wishes
bend again toward Franceand bow them
to your gracious leave and pardon.Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?He hath, my lord,
wrung from me my slow leave.I do beseech you,
give him leave to go.Take thy fair hour, Laertes -
time be thine,and thy best graces
spend it at thy will!But now,our cousin Hamlet, and our son.A little more than kin,
and less than kind.How is it that the clouds
still hang on you?Not so, my lord,
I am too much i' the sun.Good Hamlet,
cast thy nighted colour off,and let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.Do not for ever
with thy vail-ed lidsseek for thy noble father
in the dust.Thou know'st 'tis common,
all that lives must die,passing through nature to eternity.Ay, madam, it is common. If it be,why seems it
so particular with thee?Seems, madam! Nay, it is,
I know not ""seems"".'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother,nor customary suits of solemn black,together with all forms,
moods, shapes of grief,that can denote me truly.
These indeed seem,for they are actions
that a man might play.But I have that within
which passeth showthese but the trappings
and the suits of woe.Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,to give these mourning duties
to your father.But, you must know,
your father lost a father,that father lost, lost his,
and the survivor, boundin filial obligation for some termto do obsequious sorrow.But to persever
in obstinate condolementis a course of impious stubbornness.'Tis unmanly grief.I pray you, throw to earthThis unprevailing woe,
and think of usas of a father,
for let the world take note,you are the most immediate
to our throne,and with no less nobility of lovethan that which dearest father
bears his son,do I impart toward you.APPLAUSEFor your intentIn going back to school
in... Wittenberg. ..Wittenberg,it is most retrograde
to our desire.And I beseech you,
bend you to remain here,in the cheer and comfort
of our eye,our chiefest courtier, cousin,
and our son.Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.I pray thee, stay with us -
go not to Wittenberg.I shall in all my best obey you,
madam.Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.Be as ourself in Denmark.APPLAUSEMadam, come.This gentle and unforced accord
of Hamletsits smiling to my heart
in grace whereof,no jocund health
that Denmark drinks today.But the great cannon
to the clouds shall tell,re-speaking earthly thunder.
Come, away.O, that this too, too solid flesh
would melt...Thaw,and resolve itself into a dew!Or that the Everlasting
had not fix'dhis canon 'gainst self-slaughter!O God!God!HE SOBSHow weary,stale,flat and unprofitableseem to me all the uses
of this world!Fie on't! Fie!'Tis an unweeded garden,
that grows to seed.Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.That it should come to this!But two months dead -nay, not so much, not two!So excellent a king,
that was, to this,Hyperion to a satyr.So loving to my motherThat he might not beteem
the winds of heavenvisit her face too roughly.
Heaven and earth!Must I remember?Why, she would hang on him,as if increase of appetite
had grownby what it fed on
and yet, within a month...!Let me not think on't.Frailty, thy name is woman!A little month,
or 'ere those shoes were oldwith which she follow'd
my poor father's body,like Niobe, all tears
why she, even she...!O, God! A beast,
that wants discourse of reason,would have mourn'd longer.Married with my uncle.My father's brother,
but no more like my fatherthan I to Hercules within a month.'Ere yet the salt
of most unrighteous tearshad left the flushing
in her galled eyes,she married.O, most wicked speed, to postwith such dexterity
to incestuous sheets!It is not, nor it cannot
come to good.But break, my heart,
for I must hold my tongue.Hail to your lordship!
I am glad to see thee well.Horatio!Or I do forget myself!The same, my lord,
and your poor servant ever.Sir, my good friend,
I'll change that name with you.And what make you from
Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?My good lord. I am very glad
to see you. Good even, sir.But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?We'll teach you to drink deep
'ere you depart.My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.I pray thee, do not mock me,
fellow-student -I think it was to see
my mother's wedding.Indeed, my lord,
it follow'd hard upon.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!The funeral baked meatsdid coldly furnish forth
the marriage tables.My father!Methinks I see my father.Where, my lord?In my mind's eye, Horatio.I saw him once.
He was a goodly king.He was a man.
Take him for all in all.I shall not look upon
his like again.My lord...I think I saw him yesternight.
Saw who?My lord, the king your father.The king my father!Season your admiration with an
attent ear, till I may deliver,upon the witness of these gentlemen,
this marvel to you.For God's love, let me hear.Two nights together
had these gentlemen,Marcellus and Bernardo,
on their watch,in the dead vast
and middle of the night,been thus encounter'd.A figure like your father,Armed at point exactly,
cap-a-pe,appears before them,
and with solemn marchgoes slow and stately by them.
This to meIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,and I with them the third night
kept the watchwhere, as they had deliver'd,
the apparition comes.I knew your father,
these hands are not more like.But where was this? My lord, upon
the platform where we watch'd.Did you not speak to it?My lord, I did, but answer
made it none. 'Tis very strange.As I do live, my honour'd lord,
'tis true.And we did think it
writ down in our dutyto let you know of it. Indeed.Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.Hold you the watch tonight?
We do, my lord.Arm'd, say you? Arm'd, my lord.
From top to toe?My lord, from head to foot.
Then saw you not his face?O, yes, my lord,
he wore his beaver up.What look'd he - frowningly?A countenance
more in sorrow than in anger.Pale or red? Nay, very pale.And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.Very like, very like.Stay'd it long?While one with moderate haste might
tell a hundred. Longer, longer.Not when I saw't.His beard was grizzled?It was, as I have seen it
in his life,a sable silver'd.I will watch tonight -
perchance 'twill walk again.I warrant it will.If it assume
my noble father's person,I'll speak to it,
though Hell itself should gapeand bid me hold my peace.
I pray you all,if you have hitherto
conceal'd this sight,let it be tenable
in your silence still,and whatsoever else
shall hap to-night,give it an understanding,
but no tongue.I will requite your loves.So, fare you well.Upon the platform, 'twixt
eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.ALL: Our duty to your honour.My father's spirit in arms!
All is not well.I doubt some foul play.Would the night were come!Till then sit still, my soul.Foul deeds will rise,though all the earth o'erwhelm them,
to men's eyes.My necessaries are embark'd.Farewell.And, sister,
as the winds give benefitand as convoy is assistant,
do not sleep,but let me hear from you.Do you doubt that?For Hamlet and the trifling
of his favour,hold it a fashion
and a toy in blood,a violet
in the youth of primy nature.Forward, not permanent,
sweet, not lasting.The perfume and suppliance
of a minute - no more.No more but so? Think it no more.
Perhaps he loves you now,and now no soil nor cautel
doth besmirchthe virtue of his will.
But you must fear,his greatness weigh'd,
his will is not his own.For he himself
is subject to his birth.He may not,
as unvalued persons do,carve for himself,
for on his choice dependsthe safety and the health
of this whole state.And therefore must his choice
be circumscribedunto the voice and yielding of
that body whereof he is the head.Then if he says he loves you,it fits your wisdom
so far to believe itas he in his particular act
and placemay give his saying deed -
which is no furtherthan the main voice of Denmark
goes withal.Then weigh what loss
your honour may sustain,if with too credent ear
you list his songs.DISTANT THUMPOr lose your heart,
or your chaste treasure openTo his unmaster'd importunity.Fear it, Ophelia!Fear it, my dear sister,and keep you
in the rear of your affection,out of the shot
and danger of desire.Be wary, then.
Best safety lies in fear.Youth to itself rebels,
though none else near.I shall the effect
of this good lesson keep,as watchman to my heart.
But, good my brother,do not,
as some ungracious pastors do,show me the steep and thorny way
to Heaven,whiles, like a puff'd and reckless
libertine,himself the primrose path
of dalliance treads,and recks not his own rede.
O, fear me not.I stay too long,
but here my father comes.A double blessing is a double grace,
occasion smiles upon a second leave.Yet here, Laertes!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!The wind sits in the shoulder of
your sail, and you are stay'd for.There, my blessing with thee!And these few precepts
in thy memorysee thou character.
Give thy thoughts no tongue,nor any unproportioned thought
his act.Be thou familiar,
but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried,grapple them to thy soul
with hoops of steel.But do not dull thy palm
with entertainmentof each new-hatch'd,
unfledged comrade. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel,
but being in,bear't that the opposed
may beware of thee.Give every man thy ear,
but few thy voice,take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.Costly thy habit
as thy purse can buy,but not express'd in fancy!
Rich, not gaudy,for the apparel
oft proclaims the man.Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
for loan.....oft loses both
itself and friend...And borrowing...
..dulls the edge of husbandry.This above all.To thine ownself be true,And it must follow,
as the night the day,thou canst not then
be false to any man.Farewell.My blessing season this in thee!Most humbly do I take my leave,
my lord.The time invites you -
go, your servant tends.Farewell, Ophelia.And remember well
what I have said to you.Tis in my memory lock'd,and you yourself
shall keep the key of it.Farewell.DOOR CLOSESWhat is't, Ophelia,
he hath said to you?So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.Marry, well bethought.'Tis told me,
he hath very oft of lateGiven private time to you,
and you yourselfhave of your audience
been most free and bounteous.If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,and that in way of caution,
I must tell you,you do not understand yourself
so clearlyas it behoves my daughter
and your honour.What is between you?
Give me up the truth.He hath, my lord,
of late made many tendersof his affection to me.Affection! Pah!You speak like a green girl,unsifted
in such perilous circumstance.Do you believe his tenders,
as you call them?I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.Marry, I'll teach you.
Think yourself a baby,That you have ta'en these tenders
for true pay,which are not Sterling.
Tender yourself more dearly,or, not to crack the wind
of the poor phrase,running it thus
you'll tender me a fool.My lord,
he hath importuned me with lovein honourable fashion.Ay, fashion you may call it -
go to, go to.And hath given countenance to
his speech, my lord,with almost all
the holy vows of Heaven.Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
I do know,when the blood burns,
how prodigal the soullends the tongue vows.
These blazes, daughter,giving more light than heat,
extinct in both,you must not take for fire.
From this timebe somewhat scanter
of your maiden presence,for Lord Hamlet, believe so much
in him, that he is youngand with a larger tether may he walkthan may be given you.In few, Ophelia,
do not believe his vows.This is for all.I would not, in plain terms,
from this time forth,have you so slander
any moment leisure,as to give words or talk
with the Lord Hamlet.Look to't, I charge you.Come your ways.I shall obey, my lord.The air bites shrewdly -
it is very cold.It is a nipping and an eager air.What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.No, it is struck.
Indeed? I heard it not.Then it draws near the seasonwherein the spirit
held his wont to walk.BANGFIREWORK
What does this mean, my lord?The king doth wake tonight
and takes his rouse,Keeps wassail,
and the swaggering up-spring reels.And, as he drains his draughts of
Rhenish down,The kettle-drum
and trumpet thus bray outThe triumph of his pledge.
Is it a custom?Ay, marry, is't.But to my mind,
though I am native hereand to the manner born,
it is a custommore honour'd in the breach
than the observance.FIREWORKS EXPLODELook, my lord, it comes!Angels and ministers of grace
defend us!Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damn'd?Bring with thee airs from
Heaven or blasts from Hell?Be thy intents
wicked or charitable,thou comest in such
a questionable shapethat I will speak to thee.I'll call thee Hamlet,King,father,royal Dane. O, answer me!Let me not burst in ignorance,
but tellwhy thy canonised bones,
hearsed in death,have burst their cerements.
Why the sepulchre,wherein we saw thee
quietly inter'd,hath oped his ponderous
and marble jaws,to cast thee up again.
What may this mean,that thou, dead corpse,
again in complete steelrevisits thus
the glimpses of the moon,making night hideous,
and we fools of natureso horridly to shake
our dispositionwith thoughts beyond
the reaches of our souls?Say, why is this?Wherefore?What should we do?It beckons you to go away with it,As if it some impartment did desire
to you alone.It waves you to a more removed
ground. But do not go with it.No, by no means. It will not speak,
then I will follow it.Do not, my lord.
Why, what should be the fear?I do not set my life in a pin's fee.And for my soul,
what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?It waves me forth again,
I'll follow it.What if it tempt you
toward the flood, my lord,or to the dreadful summit
of the cliffthat beetles o'er his base
into the sea,and there assume
some other horrible form,which might deprive your sovereignty
of reasonand draw you into madness?
It waves me still.Go on, I'll follow thee.
You shall not go, my lord.Hold off your hands!
Be ruled - you shall not go.My fate cries out,and makes each
petty artery in this bodyas hardy as
the Nemean lion's nerve.Still am I call'd.
Unhand me, gentlemen.By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him
that lets me!I say, away!Go on, I'll follow thee.He waxes desperate with imagination.Let's follow - 'tis not fit
thus to obey him. Have after.To what issue will this come?Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.Heaven will direct it.
Nay, let's follow.Where wilt thou lead me?
Speak, I'll go no further.Mark me. I will.
My hour is almost come,when I to sulphurous
and tormenting flamesmust render up myself.Alas, poor ghost!Pity me not,but lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.Speak, I am bound to hear.So art thou to revenge,
when thou dost hear.What?I am thy father's spirit,doom'd for a certain term
to walk the night,and for the day confined
to fast in fires,till the foul crimes
done in my days of natureare burned and purged away.
But that I am forbidto tell the secrets
of my prison-house,I could a tale unfold
whose lightest wordwould harrow up thy soul,
freeze thy young blood,make thy two eyes, like stars,
start from their spheres.But this eternal blazon
must not beto ears of flesh and blood.List, list, O, list!If thou didst ever
thy dear father love... O God!..Revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder. Murder!Murder most foul!As in the best it is,but this most foul,
strange and unnatural.Haste me to know't,
that I, with wings as swiftas meditation
or the thoughts of love,may sweep to my revenge.I find thee apt.'Tis given out
that, sleeping in my orchard,a serpent stung me.But know,thou noble youth,The serpent that did sting
thy father's lifenow wears his crown.O my prophetic soul! My uncle!Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast,with witchcraft of his wit,with traitorous gifts,
won to his shameful lustthe will of my most
seeming-virtuous queen.O Hamlet,
what a falling-off was there!From me,
whose love was of that dignitythat it went hand in hand
even with the vowI made to her in marriage,
and to declineupon a wretch
whose natural gifts were poorto those of mine!But lust,
though to a radiant angel link'd,will sate itself
in a celestial bed,and prey on garbage.But, soft!Methinks I scent the morning air.Brief let me be.Sleeping within my orchard,my custom always in the afternoon,upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,with juice of curs-ed hebenon
in a vial,and in the porches of my ears
did pourthe leperous distilment,
whose effectholds such an enmity
with blood of manthat swift as quicksilver
it courses throughthe natural gates and alleys
of the body,and with a sudden vigour doth possetand curd
the thin and wholesome blood.So did it mine,and a most instant tetter
bark'd about,most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust,all my smooth body.Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's handof life, of crown, and queen,
at once dispatch'd.O, horrible!Most horrible! O God!If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not!Let not the royal bed of Denmark bea couch for luxury and damned incest.But, howsoever
thou pursuest this act,taint not thy mind,
nor let thy soul contriveagainst thy mother aught.
Leave her to Heavenand to those thorns
that in her bosom lodge,to prick and sting her.
Fare thee well at once!The glow-worm shows the matin
to be near,and 'gins to pale
his ineffectual fire.Adieu, adieu!Hamlet...VOICE ECHOES
Remember me!O all you host of Heaven!O Earth! What else?And shall I couple Hell? O, fie!Hold, hold, my heart.And you, my sinews,
grow not instant old,but bear me stiffly up.
Remember thee?!Ay, thou poor ghost,
while memory holds a seatin this distracted globe.
Remember thee?!Yea, from the table of my memoryI'll wipe away
all trivial fond records,All saws of books, all forms,
all pressures past,that youth and observation
copied there.And thy commandment
all alone shall livewithin the book and volume
of my brain,unmix'd with baser matter.
Yes, by Heaven!O most pernicious woman!O villain,villain,smiling, damned villain!My tables,
meet it is I set it down,that one may smile, and smile,and be a villain.At least,I'm sure it may be so in Denmark.So, uncle, there you are.Now to my word.It is ""Adieu, adieu! Remember me.""I have sworn 't.My lord, my lord! Heaven secure him!
So be it!Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!Hillo, ho, ho, boy!
Come, bird, come.How is't, my noble lord?What news, my lord? O, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.No, you'll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by Heaven.Nor I, my lord. How say you, then?Would heart of man once think it?But you'll be secret?
Ay, by Heaven, my lord.There's ne'er a villain
dwelling in all Denmarkbut he's an arrant knave.There needs no ghost
come from the grave to tell us this.Why, right, you are i' the right,And so, without more circumstance
at all, I hold it fit
that we shake hands and part.You, as your business and desire
shall point you,for every man
has business and desires,such as it is,
and for mine own poor part,look you, I'll go pray.These are but wild and whirling
words, my lord.I'm sorry they offend you,
heartily. Yes, 'faith heartily.There's no offence, my lord.Yes, by Saint Patrick,
but there is, Horatio,and much offence too.Touching this vision here,it is an honest ghost,
that let me tell youfor your desire
to know what is between us,O'ermaster 't as you may.
And now, good friends,as you are friends, scholars
and soldiers,give me one poor request.What is't, my lord? We will.Never make known
what you have seen tonight.
BOTH: My lord, we will not.Nay, but swear it.In faith, my lord, not I.Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Upon my sword.We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.ECHOING VOICE: Swear. Ah, ha, boy!Say'st thou so?
Art thou there, truepenny?Come on, you hear this fellow
in the cellarage -consent to swear.
Propose the oath, my lord.Never to speak of this that you
have seen, swear by my sword.ECHOING VOICE: Swear!Hic et ubique?
Then we'll shift our ground.Come hither, gentlemen, and lay
your hands again upon my sword.Never to speak of this
that you have heard.Swear by my sword.
ECHOING VOICE: Swear!Well said, old mole!Canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer!Once more remove, good friends.O day and night,
but this is wondrous strange!And therefore as a stranger
give it welcome.There are more things
in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,than are dreamt of
in our philosophy. But come!Here, as before, never,
so help you mercy,how strange or odd soe',
er I bear myself,As I perchance hereafter
shall think meetto put an antic disposition on,that you, at such times seeing me,
never shall,with arms encumber'd thus,
or this headshake,or by pronouncing of
some doubtful phrase,As ""Well, well, we know"",'
or ""We could, and if we would"",or such ambiguous giving out,
to notethat you know aught of me.
This not to do,so grace and mercy at your most need
help you - swear!LOUD ECHOING VOICE: Swear!We swear! We swear!Rest, rest, perturb-ed spirit!So, gentlemen,let us go in together;and still your fingers
on your lips, I pray.The time is out of joint.O cursed spite,that ever I was born
to set it right!Give my son this money and these
notes, Reynaldo. I will, my lord.You shall do marvellous wisely,
good Reynaldo,before you visit him,
to make inquire of his behaviour.My lord, I did intend it.Marry, well said, very well said.
Look you, sir,inquire me first
what Danskers are in Paris,and how, and who, what means,
and where they keep,what company, at what expense,
and findingby this encompassment
and drift of questionthat they do know my son,
come you more nearer.Take you, as 'twere,
some distant knowledge of himas thus,
""I know his father and his friends,""And in part him.""
Do you mark this, Reynaldo?Ay, very well, my lord.And in part him,
but you may say ""not well.""But, if't be he I mean,
he's very wild,""addicted so and so"",
and there put on himwhat forgeries you please.
Marry, none so rankas may dishonour him,
take heed of that,but, sir, such wanton, wild
and usual slipsas are companions noted
and most knownto youth and liberty.As gaming, my lord?Ay, or drinking, fencing,
swearing, quarrelling,drabbing - you may go so far.My lord, that would dishonour him.
Faith, no, as you may season it
in the charge.But, my good lord...
Wherefore should you do this?Ay, my lord, I would know that.
Marry, sir, here's my drift,and I believe, it is a fetch of wit.You laying these slight sullies
on my son,as 'twere a thing a little
soil'd i' the working, mark you,your party in converse,
him you would sound,having ever seen
in the prenominate crimesthe youth you breathe of guilty,
be assuredhe closes with you
in this consequence.""Good sir,"" or so, or ""friend"",
or ""gentleman"",'according to the phrase
or the additionof man and country.Very good, my lord.And then, sir, does he this?He does...What was I about to say?By the mass,
I was about to say something.Where did I leave?At closes in the consequence.At closes in the consequence?
Ay, marry!He closes thus -
""I know the gentleman,""I saw him yesterday,
or t' other day,""Or then, or then,
with such, or such,""and, as you say,
there was a' gaming,""there a falling out at tennis""
or perchance,""I saw him enter
such a house of sale"" -Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now -your bait of falsehood
takes this carp of truthand thus do we of wisdom
and of reach,by indirections
find directions out.You have me, have you not?
My lord, I have.God be wi' you -fare you well. Good my lord!Observe his inclinations in yourself.I shall, my lord.
And let him ply his music.Well, my lord.Farewell!Oh.How now, Ophelia! What's the matter?O, my lord, my lord,
I have been so affrighted!With what, i' the name of God?My lord,
as I was sewing in my closet,Lord Hamlet,
with his doublet all unbraced,no hat upon his head,
his stockings foul'd,ungarter'd,
and down-gyved to his ankle,pale as his shirt,
his knees knocking each other,and with a look so piteous
in purportas if he had been loosed out of Hellto speak of horrors,
he comes before me.Mad for thy love?
My lord, I do not know,but truly, I do fear it.
What said he?He took me by the wrist
and held me hard.Then goes he
to the length of all his arm,and, with his other hand thus
o'er his brow,he falls to such perusal of my faceas he would draw it.Long stay'd he so.At last,
a little shaking of mine armand thrice his head
thus waving up and down,he raised a sigh
so piteous and profoundas it did seem to shatter
all his bulkand end his being.That done, he lets me goand, with his head
over his shoulder turn'd,he seem'd to find his way
without his eyes.For out o' doors
he went without their help,and, to the last,
bended their light on me.Come.
This is the very ecstasy of love,whose violent property fordoes itselfand leads the will
to desperate undertakings.I am sorry.What, have you given him
any hard words of late?No, my good lord,
but, as you did command,I did repel his fetters and deniedhis access to me.
That hath made him mad.I am sorry that with better heed
and judgmentI had not quoted him.
I fear'd he did but trifle,and meant to wreck thee,
but, beshrew my jealousy!Come, go we to the king.This must be known.Welcome,
dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!Moreover that we much did
long to see you,the need we have to use you
did provokeour hasty sending.
Something have you heardof Hamlet's transformation.
What it should be,more than his father's death,
that thus hath put himso much from the understanding
of himself,we cannot dream of. I beseech youthat, being of such young days
brought up with him,that you vouchsafe your rest
here in our courtsome little time
so by your companiesto lead him on to pleasures,
and to gather,so much as by occasion
you may glean,whether aught, to us unknown,
afflicts him thus,that, open'd,
lies within our remedy.Good gentlemen,
he hath much talk'd of you,and sure I am two men there are
not livingto whom he more adheres.
If it will please youto show us
so much gentry and good willas to expend your time with us
awhile,for the supply and profit
of our hope,your visitation
shall receive such thanksas fits a king's remembrance.Both your majestiesmight, by the sovereign power
you have of us,put your dread pleasures
more into commandthan to entreaty.But we both obey,and here give up ourselves,
in the full bentto lay our service freely
at your feet, to be commanded.Thanks, Rosencrantz
and gentle Guildenstern.Thanks, Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz.And I beseech you instantly to
visit my too much changed son.Go, some of you, and bring these
gentlemen where Hamlet is.Heavens make our presence
and our practisespleasant and helpful to him!Ay, amen!The ambassadors from Norway,
my good lord,are joyfully return'd.Thou still hast been
the father of good news.Have I, my lord?I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,both to my God
and to my gracious king.And I do think, that I have foundthe very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.O, speak of that -
that do I long to hear.First give admittance
to the ambassadors -my news shall be
the fruit unto the feast.Thyself do grace to them,
and bring them in.He tells me, my sweet Gertrude,
that he hath foundthe head and source
of all your son's distemper.I doubt it is no other
but the main -his father's death,and our o'erhasty marriage.We will sift him.Welcome, good friends!Say, what from our brother Norway?Most fair return of
greetings and desires.He sent out to suppress
his nephew's march.The which he thought proposed
against the Poles,but, better look'd into,
he truly foundit was against Your Highness
and our state.So Fortinbras
receives rebuke from himand vows before his uncle never moreto give assay of arms
against Denmark here.Ha!It likes us well.At night we'll feast together.Most welcome home!This business is well ended.My liege, and madam, to expostulatewhat majesty should be, what duty is,why day is day, night night,and time...is time.Were nothing but to waste night,
day and time.Therefore,
since brevity is the soul of wit,and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes,I will be brief.
Your noble son is mad. Ah!Mad call I it,
for, to define true madness,what is't
but to be nothing else but mad?But let that go.
More matter, with less art.Madam, I swear I use no art at all.That he is mad, 'tis true,
'tis true 'tis pity,and pity 'tis 'tis true,
a foolish figure.But farewell it,
for I will use no art.Mad let us grant him, then
and now remainsthat we find out the cause
of this effect,or rather say,
the cause of this defect,for this effect
defective comes by cause.Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus.I have a daughter,
have while she is minewho, in her duty and obedience,
mark,hath given me this.Now gather, and surmise.""To the celestial and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia,""That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase.""Beautified"" is a vile phrase,
but you shall hear. Thus.""In her excellent white...bosom,
these...""HE TUTS
..etc.Came this from Hamlet to her?Good madam, stay awhile,
I will be faithful.""Doubt thou the stars are fire
doubt that the sun doth move,""doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love.""This, in obedience, hath my
daughter shown me, and more above.But how hath she received his love?What do you think of me?As of a friend,
faithful and honourable.I would fain prove so.
But what might you think,When I had seen this hot love
on the wingas I perceived it,
I must tell you that,before my daughter told me
what might you,Or my dear majesty your queen here,
think,If I had given my heart a winking,
mute and dumb,or look'd upon this love
with idle sight?No, I went round to work,and my young mistress
thus I did bespeak.""Lord Hamlet is a prince,
out of thy star -""this must not be.""
And then I precepts gave her,that she should lock herself
from his resort,admit no messengers,
receive no tokens.Which done,
she took the fruits of my advice.And he, repulsed,
a short tale to makefell into a sadness,
then into a fast,thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness,thence to a lightness,
and, by this declension,Into the madness
wherein now he raves,and all we mourn for.Do you think 'tis this?It may be, very likely.Hath there been such a time
I'd fain know thatthat I have positively said
'tis so,when it proved otherwise?Not that I know.Take this from this,
if this be otherwise.If circumstances lead me,
I will findwhere truth is hid,
though it were hid indeedwithin the centre.How may we try this further?You know, sometimes he walks
four hours togetherhere in the lobby.So he does indeed.At such a time
I'll loose my daughter to him.Be you and I behind an arras then,mark the encounter.
If he love her notAnd be not
from his reason fallen thereon,let me be no assistant for a state,
but keep a farm and carters.We will try it. But, look,
where sadly the poor wretch comes.Sweet Gertrude, leave us.Her father and myself,
lawful espials,thus may of their encounter
frankly judge,if be the affliction
of his love or nothat thus he suffers for.I shall obey you.And for your part, Ophelia,I do wishthat your good beauties
be the happy causeof Hamlet's wildness.
So shall I hope your virtueswill bring him
to his wonted way again,to both your honours.Madam, I wish it may.Ophelia, walk you here.Read on this book,that show of such an exercise
may colour your loneliness.I hear him coming.
Let's withdraw, my lord.To be, or not to be,that is the question.Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to sufferthe slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,or to take arms against
a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them?To die,to sleep,no more,and by a sleep to say we endthe heart-ache
and the thousand natural shocksthat flesh is heir to.'Tis a consummation.....devoutly to be wish'd.To die,to sleep.To sleep, perchance to dream.Ay, there's the rub.For in that sleep of death
what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off
this mortal coil,must give us pause.There's the respectthat makes calamity of so long life.For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time,but that the dread of
something after death?The undiscover'd country
from whose bournno traveller returns,
puzzles the willand makes us rather
bear those ills we havethan fly to others
that we know not of?Thus conscience
does make cowards of us all,and thus
the native hue of resolutionis sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought,and enterprises
of great pith and momentwith this regard
their currents turn awry,and lose the name of action.
Soft you now!The fair Ophelia!Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.Good my lord, how does your honour
for this many a day?I humbly thank you -
well, well, well.My lord,
I have remembrances of yoursthat I have long-ed long
to re-deliver.I pray you, now receive them.Not I - I never gave you aught.Mine honour'd lord,
you know right well you did,and, with them, words
of so sweet breath composedas made the things more rich.
Their perfume lost,take these again,
for to the noble mindrich gifts wax poor
when givers prove unkind.There, my lord.Are you honest?My lord?Are you fair?
What means your lordship?I did love you, once.Indeed, my lord,
you made me believe so.You should not have believed me,
I loved you not.I was the more deceived.Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst
thou be a breeder of sinners?I am myself indifferent honest,and yet I could accuse me of such
things it were better my mother
had not borne me.What should such fellows as I do,
crawling between Earth and Heaven?We are arrant knaves, all -
believe none of us.Go thy ways to a nunnery.Where's your father?At home, my lord.Let the door be shut upon him,that he may play the fool nowhere
but in his own house.Farewell.O, help him, you sweet Heavens!If thou dost marry, I'll give
you this plague for thy dowry -be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.Get thee to a nunnery,
go, farewell.Or, if thou wilt needs marry,
marry a fool,for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.To a nunnery, go, and quickly too.
Farewell.O Heavenly powers, restore him!You jig, you amble, and you lisp,and nick-name God's creatures, and
make your wantonness your ignorance.Go to, I'll no more on't,
it hath made me mad.I say,
we will have no more marriages.Those that are married already,
all but one, shall live,the rest shall keep as they are.To a nunnery, go.O, what a noble mind
is here o'erthrown!The courtier's,soldier's,scholar's, eye,tongue, sword.The expectancy and rose
of the fair state,the glass of fashionand the mould of form,the observed of all observers,quite,quite down!And I,of ladies most deject and wretched,that suck'd the honey
of his music vows,now see that noble
and most sovereign reason,like sweet bells jangled,
out of tune and harsh.That unmatch'd form
and feature of blown youthblasted with ecstasy.O, woe is me,to have seen what I have seen,see what I see!'Love! His affections
do not that way tend.'There's something in his soul,o'er which his melancholy
sits on brood,and I do think the hatch
and the disclosewill be some danger.How now, Ophelia!You need not tell us what
Lord Hamlet said, we heard it all.Away, I do beseech you,
here he comes.I'll bore him presently.How does my good Lord Hamlet?Well...God a mercy.Do you know me, my lord?Excellent well -
you are a fishmonger.Not I, my lord. Then I would
you were so honest a man.Honest, my lord! Ay, sir -
to be honest, as this world goes,is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.That's very true, my lord.For if the sun breed maggots
in a dead dog,being a god kissing carrion...
Have you a daughter?I have, my lord.Let her not walk in the sun.Conception is a blessing, but
not as your daughter may conceive.Friend, look to 't.How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter,yet he knew me not at first -
he said I was a fishmonger.He is far gone, far gone,and truly in my youth
I suffered much extremity for love -very near this.
I'll speak to him again.What do you read, my lord?Words!Words, words?What is the matter, my lord?Between who?I mean,
the matter that you read, my lord.Slanders, sir,
for the satirical rogue says herethat old men have grey beards...That their faces are wrinkled...Their eyes purging thick amber
and plum-tree gum...and that they have a most plentiful
lack of wit...well...together with most weak hams.All which, sir, though I most
powerfully and potently believe,yet I hold it not honesty
to have it thus set down.For you yourself, sir,
should be as old as I am,if like a crab
you could go backward.Though this be madness,
yet there is method in 't.Will you walk out of the air,
my lord? Into my grave?Indeed, that is out o' the air.How pregnant sometimes
his replies are!My honourable lord, I will
most humbly take my leave of you.You cannot, sir,
take from me anythingthat I would more
willingly part withalexcept my life,except my life,except my life.Fare you well, my lord.These tedious old fools!You go to seek the Lord Hamlet -
there he is.God save you, sir!My honoured lord!My most dear lord!My excellent good friends!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do ye both?As the indifferent children
of the earth.Happy, in that we are not over-happy.On fortune's cap
we are not the very button.Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.Then you live about her waist,
or in the middle of her favours?Faith, her privates we.In the secret parts of fortune?Most true, she is a strumpet.What's the news? None, my lord,but that the world's grown honest.Then is doomsday near!But your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular.What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune,that she sends you to prison hither?Prison, my lord? Denmark's a prison.Then is the world one.A goodly one, in which there are
many confines, wards and dungeons,Denmark being one o' the worst.We think not so, my lord.Why, then, 'tis none to you,for there is nothing either good
or bad, but thinking makes it so.To me it's a prison.Why then,
your ambition makes it one -'tis too narrow for your mind.O God,I could be bounded in a nut shelland count myself
a king of infinite space,were it not that I have bad dreams.Shall we to the court?
We'll wait upon you.No such matter.I will not sort you with
the rest of my servants.But, in the beaten way
of friendship,
what make you at Elsinore?To visit you, my lord, no other
occasion. Were you not sent for?Is it your own inclining?A free visitation?Come, deal justly with me.Come, nay, speak!
What should we say, my lord?Why, anything, but to the purpose.You were sent for, and there is
a kind of confession in your looks,which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour.I know the good king and queen
have sent for you.To what end, my lord?That you must teach me.But let me conjure you,
by the rights of our fellowship,be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?What say you?
Nay, then, I have an eye of you.
If you love me, hold not off.My lord, we were sent for.I will tell you why.So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery,and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather.I have,of late,but wherefore I know not,lost all my mirth,forgone all custom of exercise.And indeed it goes
so heavily with my dispositionthat this goodly frame, the Earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory,this most excellent canopy, the air,look you,
this brave o'erhanging firmament,this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire,why, it appears no other thing
to methan a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapours.What a piece of work is a man!How noble in reason!How infinite in faculty!In form and moving,
how express and admirable!In action, how like an angel!In apprehension, how like a god!The beauty of the world!The paragon of animals!And yet, to me, what is this.....quintessence of dust?Man delights not me.Uh-huh.No, nor woman neither, though by
your smiling you seem to say so.My lord, there was
no such stuff in my thoughts.Why did you laugh then,
when I said man delights not me?To think, my lord,
if you delight not in man,what Lenten entertainment
the players shall receive from you.We coted them on the way,and hither are they coming, to offer
you service. What players are they?Even those you were wont
to take delight in,
the tragedians of the city.He that plays the king
shall be welcome.His Majesty
shall have tribute of me.It is not very strange,
for mine uncle is king of Denmark,and there are those that would make
mows at him while my father lived,who'd give twenty, forty,
fifty, an hundred ducats a-piecefor his picture in little.'Sblood, there is something
in this more than natural,
if philosophy could find it out.CAR HORN
There are the players. Gentlemen,
you are welcome to Elsinore.Come then, your hands.My uncle-father and aunt-mother
are deceived.In what, my dear lord?I am but mad north-north-west.When the wind is southerly,
I know an 'awk from an 'andsaw.Well, be with you, gentlemen!Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too.
At each ear a hearer -That great baby you see there is
not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.Happily he's the second time
come to them, for they say
an old man is twice a child.I will prophesy he comes to
tell me of the players - mark it.You say right, sir -
Monday morning, 'twas so indeed.My lord, I have news to tell you.My lord, I have news to tell you!When Roscius was an actor in Rome...
The actors are come hither, my lord.Buzz, buzz! Upon mine honour...
Then came each actor on his arse.The best actors in the world,
either for tragedy, comedy, history,pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral,tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,scene individable, or poem unlimited.Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor Plautus too light.O Jephthah, judge of Israel,
what a treasure hadst thou!What a treasure had he, my lord?Why, ""One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well.""Still on my daughter.
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?If you call me Jephthah, my lord,
I have a daughter
that I love passing well.Nay, that follows not.What follows, then, my lord? You are
welcome, masters, welcome, all.I am glad to see thee well.
Welcome, good friends.O, my old friend!What, my young lady and mistress!
By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer
to Heaven than when I last saw you.Pray God, your voice be not
cracked within the ring.
We'll have a speech straight.Come, give us a taste of your
quality - come, a passionate speech.What speech, my lord?I heard thee speak me a speech once,
but it was never acted,or, if it was, not above once,
for the play, I remember,
pleased not the million.'Twas caviare to the general.One speech in it I chiefly
loved 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido,and thereabout of it especially,
where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter.If it live in your memory,
begin at this line.Let me see, let me see.""The rugged Pyrrhus, like the
Hyrcanian beast,"" - it is not so.It begins with Pyrrhus,
""The rugged Pyrrhus...""He whose sable arms...
""..whose sable arms""!Er, ""black as his purpose
did the night resemble.""When he lay couch-ed
in the ominous horse,""hath now this dread
and black complexion smear'd""With heraldry more dismal,
head to foot.""Now is he..."" Total...""total gules, roasted in wrath,""And thus o'er-sized
with coagulate gore,""with eyes like carbuncles,
the hellish Pyrrhus...""Pyrrhus...""Old grandsire Priam seeks.""So, proceed you.Fore God, my lord, well spoken,
with good accent and good discretion.Ssssh!Anon he finds him,striking too short at Greeks,
his antique sword,rebellious to his arm,
lies where it falls,repugnant to command.
Unequal match'd,Pyrrhus at Priam drives,
in rage strikes wide,but with the whiff and wind
of his fell swordhis unnerv-ed father falls.Then senseless Ilium,Seeming to feel this blow,
with flaming topstoops to his base,
and with a hideous crashtakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear
for, lo! his sword,which was declining
on the milky headof Reverend Priam,
seem'd in the air to stick.So, as a painted tyrant,
Pyrrhus stood,And like a neutral to
his will and matter,did nothing.But, as we often see,
against some storm,a silence in the Heavens,
the rack stand still,the bold winds speechless
and the orb belowas hush as death.Anon the dreadful thunderdoth rend the region,
so, after Pyrrhus' pause,arous-ed vengeance
sets him new a-work.And never did
the Cyclops' hammers fallon Mars, his armours
forged for proof eternewith less remorse
than Pyrrhus' bleeding swordnow falls on Priam.This is too long.It shall to the barber's,
with your beard. Prithee, say on.He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry,
or he sleeps.Say on, come to Hecuba.But who,O,who had seen the mobled queen?The mobled queen?
That's good, ""mobled queen"" is good.Sshh!Run barefoot up and down,
threatening the flameswith bisson rheum,
a clout about that headwhere late the diadem stood.And for a robe, about her lank
and all o'er-teemed loins,A blanket,
in the alarm of fear caught up.Who this had seen,
with tongue in venom steep'd,'gainst Fortune's state
would treason have pronounced.But if the gods themselves
did see her thenwhen she saw Pyrrhus
make malicious sportin mincing with his sword
her husband's limbs,the instant burst
of clamour that she made,unless things mortal
move them not at all,would have made milch
the burning eyes of heaven.....and passion in the gods.Look, where he has not turned
his colour and has tears in's eyes.Pray you, no more.'Tis well.I'll have thee speak out
the rest soon.APPLAUSEGood my lord, will you see
the players well bestowed?Do you hear, let them be well used,for they are the abstract
and brief chronicles of the time.My lord, I will use them
according to their desert.God's bodykins, man, much better!Use every man after his desert,
and who should 'scape whipping?Come, sirs. Follow him, friends.We'll hear a play tomorrow.Dost thou hear me, old friend?Can you play the Murder of Gonzago?Ay, my lord.
We'll ha't tomorrow night.You could, for a need,
study a speech
of some dozen or sixteen lines,which I would set down
and insert in't, could you not?Ay, my lord. Very well.Follow that lord,
and pray you, mock him not.Er...no.My good friends,
I'll leave you till night.You are welcome to Elsinore.Good my lord!Ay, so, God be wi' ye.Now I am alone.O, what a rogue and peasant slave
am I!Is it not monstrous
that this player here,but in a fiction,in a dream of passion,could force his soul
so to his own conceitthat from her workings
all his visage wann'd,tears in his eyes,
distraction in his aspect,a broken voice,
and his whole function suitingwith forms to his conceit?And all for nothing!For Hecuba!What's Hecuba to him,
or he to Hecuba,that he should weep for her?What would he do,had he the motive
and the cue for passionthat I have?
He would drown the stage in tearsand cleave the general ear
with horrid speech,make mad the guilty
and appal the free,confound the ignorant,
and amaze indeedthe very faculties of eyes and ears.
Yet I,a dull and muddy-mettled rascal,
peak,like John a'dreams,unpregnant of my cause,
and can say nothing.No, not for a king,upon whose property
and most dear lifea damn'd defeat was made.Am I a coward?Who calls me villain?Breaks my pate across?Plucks off my beard,
and blows it in my face?Tweaks me by the nose?Gives me the lie i' the throat,
as deep as to the lungs?
Who does me this? Ha!'Swounds, I should take it,
for it cannot bebut I am pigeon-liver'd
and lack gallto make oppression bitter,
or ere thisI should have fatted
all the region kiteswith this slave's offal.Bloody, bawdy villain!Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!O, vengeance!Why, what an ass am I!This is most brave,that I, the son of a dear father,murder'd,prompted to my revenge
by Heaven and Hell,must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words,and fall a-cursing,
like a very drab,a scullion! Fie upon't! Foh!About, my brain!I have heardthat guilty creatures
sitting at a playhave by the very cunning
of the scenebeen struck so to the soul
that presentlythey have proclaim'd
their malefactions.For murder, though it
have no tongue, will speakwith most miraculous organ.I'll have these playersplay something like the murder
of my fatherbefore mine uncle.I'll observe his looks,
I'll tent him to the quick.If he but blench,I know my course.The spirit that I have seenmay be a devil
and the devil hath powerto assume a pleasing shape.
Yea, and perhapsout of my weakness
and my melancholy,as he is very potent with such
spirits, abuses me to damn me.I'll have grounds
More relative than this.The play's the thingwherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.And can you,
by no drift of conference,get from him
why he puts on this confusion?He does confess
he feels himself distracted,but from what cause
he will by no means speak.Nor do we find him forward
to be sounded,but, with a crafty madness,
keeps aloof,when we would bring him on to some
confession of his true state.Did he receive you well?Most like a gentleman. But with
much forcing of his disposition.Niggard of question, but, of our
demands, most free in his reply.Did you assay him? To any pastime?Madam, it so fell out,
that certain playerswe o'er-raught on the way,
of these we told him,and there did seem in him a kind of
joy to hear of it. 'Tis most true.And he beseech'd me
to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter.With all my heart,
and it doth much content meto hear him thus inclined.Good gentlemen,
give him a further edge, and drive
his purpose on to these delights.We shall, my lord.I have in quick determination
thus set it down.He shall with speed to England.Haply the seas
and countries differentwith variable objects will expelThis something-settled matter
in his heart,whereon his brains still beating
puts him thusfrom fashion of himself.
What think you on't?It shall do well,
but yet do I believeThe origin and commencement
of his griefsprung from neglected love.My lord, do as you please,but, if you hold it fit,
after the playlet his queen mother all alone
entreat himto show his grief.
Let her be round with him,and I'll be placed, so please you,
in the earOf all their conference.
If she find him not,to England send him,
or confine him whereyour wisdom best shall think.It shall be so.Madness in great ones
must not unwatch'd go.Speak the speech, I pray you,
as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue,but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do,I had as lief the town-crier
spoke my lines.Nor do not saw the air too much
with your hands, thus,but use all gently,
for in the very torrent, tempest,and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion,you must acquire and beget
a temperancethat may give it smoothness.O, it offends me to the soul to
hear a robustious periwig-pated
fellow tear a passion to tatters,to very rags, to split the ears of
the groundlings,who for the most part
are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise.I would have such a fellow whipped
for o'erdoing Termagant.It out-Herods Herod.
Pray you, avoid it.I warrant your honour.Be not too tame neither,but let your own discretion
be your tutor.Suit the action to the word,
the word to the action.With this special observance,that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature.For any thing so overdone is from
the purpose of playing, whose end,both at the first and last,
was and is, to hold, as 'twere,
the mirror up to nature,to show virtue her own feature,scorn her own image,and the very age
and body of the timeis form and pressure.Now this overdone,
or come tardy off,though it make
the unskilful laugh,cannot but make
the judicious grieve,the censure of the which
one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others.I hope we have reformed that
indifferently with us, sir.O, reform it altogether.And let those that play your clownsspeak no more than
is set down for them,for there be of them
that will themselves laugh,to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too,though, in the mean time,
some necessary question of
the play be then to be considered.That's villanous,
and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it.Go, make you ready.
How now, my lord!Will the king
hear this piece of work?And the queen too,
and that presently.Bid the players make haste.Da!Will you two help to hasten them?We will, my lord.What ho! Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.Horatio, thou art e'en as just
a man as e'er my conversation
coped withal. O, my dear lord.Nay, do not think I flatter.
Dost thou hear?Since my dear soul
was mistress of her choiceand could of men distinguish,
her electionhath seal'd thee for herself.
Give me that manthat is not passion's slave,
and I will wear himin my heart's core,
ay, in my heart of heart,as I do thee.
Something too much of this.There is a play tonight
before the king.One scene of it comes near the
circumstance which I have told
thee of my father's death.I prithee,
when thou seest that act afoot,even with the very comment
of thy soul,observe mine uncle.
If his occulted guiltdo not itself unkennel
in one speech,it is a damned ghost
that we have seen,and my imaginations are as foul as
Vulcan's smithy.Well, my lord, if he steal aught
the whilst this play is playing,and 'scape detecting,
I will pay the theft.
MUSIC STARTSThey are coming to the play.I must be idle. Get you a place.HAMLET WHISTLES ALONG TO MUSICHow fares our cousin Hamlet?Excellent, i' faith,
of the chameleon's dish
I eat the air, promise-crammed.I have nothing with this answer,
Hamlet, these words are not mine.No, nor mine now.
My lord, you played once
i' the university, you say?That did I, my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.What did you enact?I did enact Julius Caesar.I was killed i' the Capitol.Brutus killed me.It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.Be the players ready? Ay, my lord,
they stay upon your patience.Come hither, my dear Hamlet,
sit by me.No, good mother,here's metal more attractive.O, ho! Do you mark that?Lady, shall I lie in your lap?No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?Ay, my lord. Do you think I meant
country matters?I think nothing, my lord.That's a fair thought.
To lie between maids' legs.What is, my lord? Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.Who, I? Ay, my lord.O God, your only jig-maker.
What should a man do but be merry?For, look,
how cheerfully my mother looks,and my father died these two hours.Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.So long?
Nay then, let the devil wear black,
for I'll have a suit of sables.O heavens!Die two months ago,
and not forgotten yet?PLAYERS GIBBERDead!APPLAUSEWhat means this, my lord?Marry, this is miching mallecho.
It means mischief.Belike this show
imports the argument of the play.We shall know by this fellow -
the players cannot keep counsel.
They'll tell all.For us, and for our tragedy,Here stooping to your clemency,
we beg your hearing patiently.Is this a prologue,
or the posy of a ring?Tis brief, my lord.As woman's love.MUSIC STARTSFull 30 years hath
passed in sacred bannssince love our hearts
and Hymen joined our hands.So many journeys
may the sun and moonmake us again count o'er
ere love be done!Faith, I must leave thee, love,
and shortly too.My operant powers
their functions leave to do.And thou shalt live
in this fair world behind,honour'd, beloved,
and haply one as kindfor husband shalt thou.O, confound the rest!Such love must needs
be treason in my breast.In second husband let me be accurst!None wed the second
but who kill'd the first.A second time
I kill my husband dead,when second husband
kisses me in bed.I do believe you think
what now you speakbut what we do determine
oft we break.So think thou wilt
no second husband wed,but die thy thoughts
when thy first lord is dead.Nor Earth to me give food,
nor heaven light!Sport and repose
lock from me day and night!Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife,if, once a widow, ever I be wife!If she should break it now!'Tis deeply sworn.Sweet, leave me here awhile.My spirits grow dull,
and fain I would beguilethe tedious day with sleep.Sleep rock thy brain,and never come mischance
between us twain!Madam, how like you this play?The lady doth protest too much,
methinks.LAUGHTERO, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the argument?Is there no offence in't? No, no,
they do but jest, poison in jest.No offence i' the world.What do you call the play?The Mouse-trap.The play is the image of
a murder done in Vienna.Gonzago is the duke's name,
his wife, Baptista.You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish
piece of work, but what o' that?Your majesty and we that have
free souls, it touches us not.Let the gall-ed jade wince,
our withers are unwrung.Ah, this is one Lucianus,
nephew to the king.You are as good as a chorus,
my lord.I could interpret between you
and your love, if I could
see the puppets dallying.You are keen, my lord, you are keen.Begin, murderer.Pox, leave thy damnable faces,
and begin.Come, the croaking raven
doth bellow for revenge.Thoughts black,hands apt, drugs fit,
and time agreeing.Confederate season,
else no creature seeing.Thou mixture rank,
of midnight weeds collected,with Hecate's ban
thrice blasted, thrice infected.Thy natural magic
and dire property,on wholesome life usurp immediately.He poisons him
in the garden for his estate.His name's Gonzago. The play is
extant, and writ in choice Italian.You shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.The king rises.
What, frighted with false fire?How fares my lord?
Give o'er the play.Give me some light.Away! Lights, lights, lights!O good Horatio, I'll take the
ghost's word for a thousand pound.Didst perceive? Very well, my lord.Upon the talk of the poisoning?I did very well note him.
Come, some music!Come, the recorder!For if the king like not the comedy,why then,
belike he like it not, perdy.Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word
with you. Sir, a whole history.The king, sir. Ay, sir, what of him?Is in his retirement
marvellous distempered.With drink, sir?No, my lord, rather with choler.Good my lord, put your discourse
into some frameand start not so wildly
from my affair.I am tame, sir. Pronounce.The queen, your mother,
in most great affliction of spirit,
hath sent me to you.You are welcome. Nay good my lord.If it shall please you to make me
a wholesome answer, I will do
your mother's commandment.Oh, oh, oh, sir, I cannot. What, my
lord? Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit's diseased.My mother, you say?
Then thus she says,your behavior hath struck her
into wonder and astonishment.O, wonderful son,that can so astonish a mother!Impart.
She desires to speak with you
in her closet, ere you go to bed.We shall obey,
were she ten times our mother.Have you any further trade with us?My lord,you once did love me.So I do still,by these pickers and stealers.Good my lord,
what is your cause of distemper?You do, surely, bar the door
upon your own liberty,if you deny your griefs
to your friend.Sir, I lack advancement.How can that be, when you have
the voice of the king himself
for your succession in Denmark?Ay, but sir,while the grass grows...The proverb is something musty.O, the recorder! Let me see one.To withdraw with you.Why do you go about to recover
the wind of me,as if you would
drive me into a toil?O, my lord, if my duty be too bold,
my love is too unmannerly.I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?My lord, I cannot. I pray you.
Believe me, I cannot.I do beseech you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.'Tis as easy as lying.Govern these ventages
with your fingers and thumb,
give it breath with your mouth,and it will discourse
most eloquent music.Look you, these are the stops.But these cannot I command
to any utterance of harmony.
I have not the skill.Why, look you now,how unworthy a thing you make of me!You would play upon ME.You would seem to know my stops.You would pluck out
the heart of my mystery.You would sound me from my lowest
note to the top of my compassand there is much music, excellent
voice, in this little organ,yet cannot you make it speak?'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe?Call me what instrument you will,
though you can fret me,you cannot play upon me.God bless you, sir!My lord,
the queen would speak with you...THEY PLAY RECORDERS..and presently!Do you see yonder cloud
that's almost in shape of a camel?By the mass,
and 'tis like a camel, indeed.Methinks it is like a weasel.It is backed like a weasel.Or like a whale? Very like a whale.Then I will come to
my mother by and by.They fool me to the top of my bent.I will come by and by.I will say so.
By and by is easily said!Leave me, friends.HAMLET PLAYS ""THREE BLIND MICE""'Tis now the very
witching time of night,when churchyards yawn
and Hell itself breathes outcontagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood,and do such bitter business
as the daywould quake to look on.Soft! Now to my mother.I will speak daggers to her,
but use none.I like him not,
nor stands it safe with usto let his madness range.
Therefore prepare you.I your commission
will forthwith dispatch,and he to England
shall along with you.The terms of our estate
may not endurehazard so dangerous
as doth hourly growout of his lunacy.We will ourselves provide.Most holy and religious fear it isto keep those many, many bodies safethat live and feed
upon your majesty.Never alone did the king sigh,
but with a general groan.For majesty is like a massy wheel,fix'd on the summit
of the highest mountto whose huge spokes
10,000 lesser thingsare morticed and adjoin'd.Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage,for we will fetters put
upon this fear,which now goes too free-footed.We will haste us.My lord,
he's going to his mother's closet.Behind the arras
I'll convey myselfto hear the process -
I'll warrant she'll tax him home.Fare you well, my liege.I'll call upon you ere you go
to bed, and tell you what I know.Thanks, dear my lord.HE COUGHSO, my offence is rank.It smells to heaven.It hath the primal eldest curse
upon't -a brother's murder.Pray can I not,though inclination
be as sharp as will -my stronger guilt
defeats my strong intent.And, like a man
to double business bound,I stand in pause
where I shall first begin,and both neglect.What if this curs-ed handwere thicker than itself
with brother's blood?Is there not rain enough
in the sweet Heavensto wash it white as snow?Whereto serves mercybut to confront
the visage of offence?And what's in prayer
but this two-fold forceto be forestalled
ere we come to fall,or pardon'd, being down?Then I'll look up.My fault is past.But, O, what form of prayercan serve my turn?
""Forgive me my foul murder?""That cannot be,
since I am still possess'dof those effects
for which I did the murder -my crown, mine own ambition
and my queen.May one be pardon'd
and retain the offence?In the corrupted currents
of this world,offence's gilded hand
may shove by justice,and oft 'tis seen
the wicked prize itselfbuys out the law,
but 'tis not so above.There is no shuffling.There the action liesin his true nature,
and we ourselves compell'd,even to the teeth
and forehead of our faults,to give in evidence.What then?What rests?Try what repentance can.O...what can it not?But what can it,
when one cannot repent?O wretched state!O bosom black as death!O lime-ed soul, that,
struggling to be free,art more engaged!Help, angels!Make assay!Bow, stubborn knees,and heart with strings of steel,be soft as sinews
of the newborn babe.All may yet be well.HE MOUTHSNow might I do it pat,now he is praying.And now I'll do't!And so he goes to heaven,and so am I revenged.
That would be scann'd.A villain kills my father,
and for that,I, his sole son,
do this same villain send to Heaven?O, this is hire and salary,
not revenge.He took my father grossly,
full of bread,with all his crimes broad blown,
as flush as May.And how his audit stands,
who knows save Heaven?Am I then revenged,to take him
in the purging of his soul,when he is fit and season'd
for his passage?No!Up, blade,and know thou a more horrid hent,when he is drunk asleep,
or in his rage,or in the incestuous pleasure
of his bed,at gaming, swearing,
or about some actthat has no relish
of salvation in't.Then trip him, that his heels
may kick at Heaven,and that his soul may be
as damn'd and blackas Hell, whereto it goes.My mother stays.This physic but prolongs
thy sickly days.My words fly up,my thoughts remain below.Words without thoughts
never to Heaven go.He will come straight.
Look you, lay home to him.Tell him his pranks
have been too broad to bear with,And that your grace hath screen'd
and stood betweenMuch heat and him.
I'll silence me even here.Pray you, be round with him.
KNOCK AT DOORI'll warrant you, Fear me not.
Withdraw, I hear him coming.Mother! Mother!Mother!Now, Mother, what's the matter?Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended.Mother, you have my father
much offended.Come, come, you answer
with an idle tongue.Go, go, you question with a wicked
tongue. Why, how now, Hamlet!What's the matter now?Have you forgot me?No, by the rood, not so.You are the queen,
your husband's brother's wife,and - would it were not so! -you are my mother.Nay, then, I'll set those to you
that can speak.Come, come, and sit you down,
you shall not budge.You go not till I set you up a glasswhere you may see
the inmost part of you.What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me!Help, help, ho!What, ho! Help, help, help! How now!A rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!GUNSHOTWhat hast thou done?Nay, I know not. Is it the king?O, what a rash and bloody deed
is this!A bloody deed!
Almost as bad, good mother,as kill a king,
and marry with his brother.As kill a king!Ay, lady, 'twas my word.Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell!I took thee for thy better.
Take thy fortune.Leave wringing of your hands.
Peace! Sit you down,and let me wring your heart,
for so I shall,if it be made of penetrable stuff.What have I done,
that thou darest wag thy tonguein noise so rude against me?
Such an actThat blurs the grace
and blush of modesty,Calls virtue hypocrite,
makes marriage-vowsas false as dicers' oaths.
Ay me, what act,that roars so loud,
and thunders in the index?Look here, upon this picture,and...on this.The counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.See, what a grace
was seated on this brow.Hyperion's curls,the front of Jove himself.An eye like Mars,
to threaten and command.A station like the herald Mercurynew-lighted
on a Heaven-kissing hill,a combination and a form indeed,where every god
did seem to set his seal,to give the world
assurance of a man.This was your husband.Look you now, what follows.Here is your husband,
like a mildew'd ear,blasting his wholesome brother.
Have you eyes?Could you on this fair
mountain leave to feed,and batten on this moor? Ha!
Have you eyes?You cannot call it love,
for at your agethe hey-day in the blood is tame,
it's humble,and waits upon the judgement
and what judgementwould step from this to this?
What devil was'tthat thus hath cozen'd you
at hoodman-blind?Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight,ears without hands or eyes,
smelling sans all,or but a sickly part
of one true senseCould not so mope.O shame! Where is thy blush?O Hamlet, speak no more.Thou turn'st mine eyes
into my very soul.and there I see such black
and grain-ed spotsas will not leave their tinct.Nay, but to livein the rank sweat
of an enseam-ed bed,stew'd in corruption,
honeying and making loveover the nasty sty.
O, speak to me no more!These words, like daggers,
enter in mine ears.No more, sweet Hamlet!A murderer and a villain.A slave that is not
twentieth part the titheof your precedent lord.
A vice of kings,a cutpurse of the empire
and the rule,who from a shelf
the precious diadem stole,and put it in his pocket! No more!A king of shreds and patches.
CLOCK CHIMESSave me, and hover o'er me
with your wings,you heavenly guards!What would your gracious figure?
Alas, he's mad!Do you not come
your tardy son to chide,that, lapsed in time and passion,
lets go bythe important acting
of your dread command?O, say!Do not forget this visitationis but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.But, look, amazement
on thy mother sits.O, step between her
and her fighting soul.Conceit in weakest bodies
strongest works.Speak to her, Hamlet.How is it with you, lady?Alas, how is't with you,that you do bend your eye on vacancyand with the incorporal air
do hold discourse?Forth at your eyes
your spirits wildly peep.O gentle son, upon the heat
and flame of thy distempersprinkle cool patience.
Whereon do you look?On him, on him! Look you!
How pale he glares!Do not look upon me,lest with this piteous action
you convertmy stern effects.
Then what I have to dowill want true colour,
tears perchance for blood.To whom do you speak this?Do you see nothing there?Nothing at all, yet all there is
I see. Nor did you nothing hear?No, nothing but ourselves.Why, look you now!
Look, how it steals away!My father, in his habit as he lived!Look, where he goes, even now,
out at the portal!This is the very coinage
of your brain.This bodiless creation ecstasyis very cunning in.Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours,
doth temperately keep time,and makes as healthful music.
It is not madnessthat I have utter'd.
Bring me to the test,I the matter will re-word,
which madness would gambol from.Mother, for love of grace,lay not that flattering unction
to your soul,that not your trespass,
but my madness speaks.It will but skin and film
the ulcerous place,whilst rank corruption,
mining all within,infects unseen.
Confess yourself to Heaven,repent what's past,
avoid what is to come,and do not spread the compost
on the weedsto make them ranker.O Hamlet,
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.O, throw away the worser
part of it,and live the purer with
the other half.Good night,but go not to mine uncle's bed.Assume a virtue, if you have it not.Refrain tonight, and that
shall lend a kind of easinessto the next abstinence.Once more, good night.And when you are desirous
to be bless'd,I'll blessing beg of you.For this same lord,I do repent,but Heaven hath pleased it so,to punish me with this
and this with me,that I must be their
scourge and minister.I will bestow him,and will answer well
the death I gave him.So, again, good night.I must be cruel, only to be kind.Thus bad beginsand worse remains behind.One more word, good lady.
What shall I do?Not this, by no means,
that I bid you do.Let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed,pinch wanton on your cheeks,
call you his mouse.And let him,
for a pair of reechy kisses,or paddling in your neck
with his damn'd fingers,make you to
ravel all this matter out,that I essentially am not
in madness, but mad in craft.Be thou assured,
if words be made of breath,and breath of life,
I have no life to breathewhat thou hast said to me.Sssh.I must to England, you know that?Alack, I had forgot.'Tis so concluded on.There's letters seal'dand my two schoolfellows,whom I will trust
as I will adders fang'd,they bear the mandate,they must sweep my way, and
marshal me to knavery. Let it work.For 'tis the sport
to have the engineerhoist with his own
petard and 't shall go hard.But I will delve
one yard below their mines,and blow them at the moon.O, 'tis most sweet,when in one line
two crafts directly meet.This man shall set me packing.I'll lug the guts into
the neighbour room.Mother, good night.Indeed this counsellor
is now most still,most secretand most grave,who was in life a foolish
prating knave.Come, sir,to draw toward an end with you.Good night, mother.SHE LAUGHS THEN SOBSThere's matter in these sighs,
these profound heaves.You must translate.'Tis fit we understand them.Where is your son?Ah, my good lord, what have I seen
tonight! What, Gertrude?How does Hamlet?Madas the sea and wind, when both
contend which is the mightier.In his lawless fit,behind the mirror
hearing something stir,whips out his weapon, cries,
""A rat, a rat!""And, in this brainish apprehension,kills the unseen good old man.O, heavy deed!It had been so with us,
had we been there.His liberty is full
of threats to all.To you yourself, to us,to every one.Alas, how will this
bloody deed be answer'd?It will be laid to us,whose providence
should have kept short,restrain'd and out of haunt,
this mad young man.But so much was our love, we could
not understand what was most fit.But, like the owner
of a foul disease,to keep it from divulging,
let it feed,even on the pith of Life.Where is he gone? To draw apart
the body he hath kill'd,o'er whom his madness
weeps for what is done.O Gertrude, come! The sun no
sooner shall the mountains touch,but we will ship him hence.And this vile deed we must,
with all our majesty and skill,both countenance and excuse.Guildenstern!Friends both, go
join you with some further aid.Hamlet in madness
hath Polonius slain,and from his mother's closet
hath he dragg'd him.Go seek him out.Speak fair,
and bring the body into the chapel.I pray you, make haste.Oh, Gertrude, come.Let's call up our wisest friends,and let them know
both what we mean to doand what's untimely done.Come away.My soul is full of
discord and dismay.SHOUTINGSafely stowed.Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!What noise?Here they come.What have you done, my lord,
with the dead body?Compounded it with dust,
whereto 'tis kin.Tell us where 'tis, that we may take
it thence and bear it to the chapel.Do not believe it. Believe what?That I can keep your
counsel and not mine own.Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!What replication should be
made by the son of a king?Take you me for a sponge, my lord?Ay, sir,that soaks up
the king's countenance,his rewards, his authorities.But such officers do the
king best service in the end.He keeps them,like an ape, an apple
in the corner of his jaw.First mouthed,to be last swallowedwhen he needs what you have gleaned,
it is but squeezing you,and, sponge, you shall be dry again.I understand you not, my lord.I am glad of it.A knavish speech
sleeps in a foolish ear.My lord, you must tell us where the
body is, and go with us to the king.The body is with the king,
but the king is not with the body.The king is a thing.A thing, my lord! Of nothing.Bring me to him.Hide fox, and all after.I have sent to seek him,
and to find the body.How dangerous is it
that this man goes loose!Yet must not we put
the strong law on him.He's loved
of the distracted multitude,who like not in their judgment,
but their eyes.And where tis so,
the offender's scourge is weigh'd,but never the offence.To bear all smooth and even,this sudden sending him away
must seem deliberate cause.Diseases desperate grown by
desperate measure are relieved,or not at all.
How now! what hath befall'n?Where the dead body is bestow'd,
my lord, We cannot get from him.But where is he? Without, my lord,
guarded, to know your pleasure.Bring him before us.
Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.Now, Hamlet,where is Polonius?At supper.At supper! Where?Not where he eats,
but where he is eaten.A certain convocation of
politic worms are e'en at him.Your worm is your
only emperor for diet.We fat all creatures else
to fat ourselves,we fat ourselves for maggots.
Alas, alas!A man may fish with the worm that
hath eat of a king, and eat of the
fish that hath fed of that worm.What dost you mean by this?Nothing but to show you how
a king may go a progress
through the guts of a beggar.Where is Polonius?In heaven!Send hither to see.If your messenger find him
not there, seek him i'
the other place yourself.But indeed, if you find
him not within this...month,you shall nose him
as you go upstairs into the lobby.Seek him there.He will stay till ye come.Hamlet, this deed,
for thine especial safety,which we do tender, as we dearly
grieve for that which thou hast done,must send thee hence
with fiery quickness.Therefore prepare thyself.The bark is ready, and the wind
at help, the associates tend,and everything is bent for England.
For England!Ay, Hamlet. Good. So is it,
if thou knew'st our purposes.I see a cherub that sees them.Come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.Thy loving father, Hamlet.My mother,father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh,
and so, my mother.Come, for England!Whee!Follow him at foot.
Tempt him with speed aboard.Delay it not.
I'll have him hence tonight.For every thing is seal'd and done
that else leans on this affair. Away.And, England,if my love thou hold'st at aught,thou mayst not coldly set
our sovereign purpose.The present death of Hamlet.Do it, England,for like the hectic in my blood
he rages, and thou must cure me.Till I know 'tis done,whate'er may hap,
my joys were ne'er begun.I will not speak with her.
She is importunate, indeed distract.Her mood will needs be pitied.What would she have?
She speaks much of her father,says she hears there's tricks i'
the world, speaks things in doubt,that carry but half sense.
Her speech is nothing,yet the unshaped use of it doth
move the hearers to collection.'Twere good she was spoken with,for she may strew dangerous
conjectures in ill-breeding minds.Let her come in.To my sick soul,as sin's true nature is, each toy
seems prologue to some great amiss.So full of artless jealousy
is guilt,it spills itself
in fearing to be spilt.Where is the beauteous
majesty of Denmark?How now, Ophelia!# How should your true love know# From another one?# By his cockle hat and staff# And his sandal shoon... #Alas, sweet lady,
what imports this song?Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.# He is dead and gone, lady# He is dead and gone# At his head a grass-green turf# At his heels a stone... #Nay, but, Ophelia... PRAY YOU, MARK!# White his shroud
as the mountain snow# Larded with sweet flowers# Which bewept to the grave
did not go# With true-love showers. #How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God 'ild you!They say the owl
was a baker's daughter.O Lord, we know what we are,but know not what we may be.God be at your table!Conceit upon her father. Pray you,
let's have no words of this.But when they ask you what
it means, say you this -# Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day# All in the morning betime# And I a maid at your window# To be your valentine# Then up he rose
and donn'd his clothes# And dupp'd the chamber-door# Let in the maid
that out a maid never departed more# I'll make an end on't# By Gis and by Saint Charity# Alack, and fie for shame!# Young men will do't,
if they come to't# By cock, they are to blame# Quoth she, before you tumbled me,# You promised me to wed# So would I ha' done, by yonder sun# An thou hadst not
come to my bed. #How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well.We must be patient,but I cannot choose but weep,
to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground.My brother shall know of it and so
I thank you for your good counsel.Come, my coach!Good night, ladies,
good night, sweet ladies,
good night, good night.Follow her close.Give her good watch, I pray you.O, this is the poison of deep grief.It springs all from her
father's death and now, behold.O, Gertrude, Gertrude.When sorrows come, they come not
single spies but in battalions.First, her father slain.Next, your son gone,
and he most violent author
of his own just remove.The people muddied,
sick and unwholesome in theirthoughts and whispers
for good Polonius' death,and we have done but greenly,
in hugger-mugger thus to inter him.Poor Ophelia,divided from herself and her
fair judgment, without the
which we are but pictures,or mere beasts.Last, and yet as much
containing all of these,her brother is in secret
come from France,and wants not buzzers
to infect his earwith pestilent speeches
of his father's death.THUMPING ON DOORAlas, what noise is this?Where are my Switzers?
Bid them guard the door.Save yourself, my lord.Laertes, in a riotous head,
o'erbears your officers.The rabble call him lord. They cry,
""Choose we, Laertes shall be king.""Caps, hands, and tongues
applaud it to the clouds.""Laertes shall be king,
Laertes king!""How cheerfully on
the false trail they cry!O, this is counter,
you false Danish dogs!BANGING
The doors are broken.O, vile king, give me my father!Calmly, good Laertes.That drop of blood that's calm
proclaims me bastard.What is the cause, Laertes, that
thy rebellion looks so giant-like?Let him go, Gertrude.Do not fear our person.There is such divinity
doth hedge a king,that treason can but
peep to what it would,acts little of his will.Tell me, Laertes, why art thou
thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.Speak, man. Where is my father?Dead. But not by him.Let him demand his fill.
How came he dead?I'll not be juggled with.To hell, allegiance!
Vows, to the blackest devil!Conscience and grace,
to the profoundest pit!I dare damnation.To this point I stand,
let come what comes,only I'll be revenged
most thoroughly for my father.Who shall stay you?
My will, not all the world's.Good Laertes,
if you desire to know the certainty
of your dear father's death,is't writ in your revenge
that, swoopstake, you will draw both
friend and foe, winner and loser?None but his enemies.
Will you know them then?To his good friends,
thus wide I'll ope my arms,and like the kind life-rendering
pelican, repast them with my blood.Why, now you speak like a
good child and a true gentleman.That I am guiltless of your
dear father's death,
and am most sensibly in grief for it.It shall as level to your judgment
pierce as day does to your eye.Let her come in.
How now! What noise is that?O heat, dry up my brains!Tears seven times salt, burn out
the sense and virtue of mine eye!O rose of May!Dear maid, kind sister,
sweet Ophelia!O heavens! Is't possible, a
young maid's wits should be as
mortal as an old man's life?# They bore him barefaced
on the bier# Hey, nonny nonny, nonny, no# And in his grave
rain'd many a tear# Fare you well, my dove! #Hadst thou thy wits,
and didst persuade revenge,
it could not move thus.(You must sing a-down a-down,
an' you call him a down...) This
nothing's more than matter.There's rosemary,that's for remembrance.Pray, love, remember.And there is pansies.That's for thoughts.A document in madness,thoughts and remembrance fitted.There's fennel for you,and columbines.There's rue for you,and here's some for me.We may call itherb-grace o' Sundays.O, you must wear your rue
with a difference.There's a daisy.I would give you some violets,but they witheredallwhen my father died.They say he made a good end.# For bonny sweet Robin
is all my joy... #Thought and affliction, passion,hell itself, she turns to
favour and to prettiness.# And will he not come again?# And will he not come again?# No, no, he is dead# Go to thy death-bed# He never will come again# His beard was as white as snow# All flaxen was his poll# He is gone, he is gone... #And we cast away moanGod ha' mercy on his soul!And of all Christian souls,
I pray God.God be wi' ye.Do you see this, O God?Laertes.I must commune with your grief,
or you deny me right.Go but apart, make choice
of whom your wisest friends you will.And they shall hear and judge
'twixt you and meif by direct or by collateral handthey find us touch'd,
we will our kingdom give, our crown,our life, yea all that we call ours,to you in satisfaction.But if not,be you content
to lend your patience to us,and we will jointly labour with
your soul to give it due content.Let this be so.And where the offence is,let the great axe fall.Go, captain,
from me greet the Danish king.Tell him that, by his licence,
Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of
a promised march over his kingdom.I will do so, my lord. Go safely on.Sir, whose powers are these?They are of Norway, sir.How purposed, sir, I pray you?Against some part of Poland.Who commands them, sir?The nephew to old Norway,
Fortinbras.Goes it against the main of
Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patchof ground that hath in
it no profit but the name.To pay five ducats, five,
I would not farm it.Why, then the Polack
never will defend it.Yes, it is already garrison'd.Two thousand souls and
20,000 ducats will not debate
the question of this straw.I humbly thank you, sir.God be wi' you, sir.How all occasions
do inform against me,and spur my dull revenge.I do not know why yet I live to say
""This thing's to do,""Sith I have causeand willand strength and means to do't.Examples gross as earth
exhort me.Witness this army
of such mass and chargeled by a delicate
and tender prince,whose spirit with
divine ambition puff'dmakes mouths at the invisible event,exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune,death and danger dare,even for an egg-shell.O, from this time forth,My thoughts be bloody,or be nothing worth!Laertes, was your father dear to you?Or are you but the painting of
a sorrow, a face without a heart?Why ask you this?Hamlet comes back.What will you undertake,to prove yourself your father's son
in deed more than in words?To cut his throat i' the church.No place, indeed,
should murder sanctuarize,Revenge should know no bounds.But, good Laertes, will you do this,
stay close within your chamber.Hamlet return'd shall
know you are come home.We'll set on those who'll
praise your excellence,and for your rapier
most especially, bring you in fine
together and wager on your heads.He, being remiss,
and free from all contriving,will not peruse the foils, so that,with ease, or a little shuffling,you may choose a sword unblunted,and in a pass of practise
requite him for your father.I will do it.And, for that purpose,
I'll anoint my sword.I bought an unction of a mountebankso mortal that,
but dip a knife in it,where it draws blood
no cataplasm so rarecan save the thing from death
that's scratch'd withal.I'll touch my point with this
contagion, that, if I but gall him
slightly, it may be his death.Hm. Let's further think on this.If this should fail
and that our drift look through
our bad performance,'twere better not assay'd.Therefore this plot should have a
back or second, that might hold,
if this did blast in proof.Soft!I ha't.When in your motion you
are hot and dry - as make your
bout more violent to that end -and that he calls for drink,I'll have prepared him a chalice
for the nonce, whereon but sipping,if, by chance, he escape your venom'd
stuck, our purpose will hold there.How now, sweet queen?One woe doth tread upon
another's heel, so fast they follow.Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.Drown'd? Where?There is a willowgrows aslant a brook,that shows his hoar leaves
in the glassy stream.There with fantastic garlands
did she comeof crow-flowers, nettles,daisies, and long purples - that
liberal shepherds
give a grosser name -but our cold maids
do dead men's fingers call them.There, on the pendent boughs her
coronet weeds clambering to hang,an envious sliver broke,when down her
weedy trophies and herselffell in the weeping brook.Her clothesspread wide, and,mermaid-like,
awhile they bore her up,which time she chanted
snatches of old tunes,as one incapable
of her own distress,or like a creature native
and indued Unto that element,but long it could not betill that her garments,
heavy with their drink,Pull'd the poor wretch from hermelodious layto muddy death.
Alas, then, she is drown'd?Drown'd.Drown'd.Too much of water hast
thou, poor Ophelia,and therefore,I forbid my tears, but yet...It is our trick,nature her custom holds, let shame
say what it will. Adieu, my lord.I have a speech of fire,
that fain would blaze,but that this folly douses it.Let's follow, Gertrude.How much I had to do
to calm his rage.Now fear I
this will give it start again.Is she to be buried
in Christian burialthat wilfully
seeks her own salvation?I tell thee, she is.And, therefore,
make her grave straight.Well, how can that be, unless she
drowned herself in her own defence?Why, 'tis found so.It must be se offendendo,it cannot be else.
For here lies the point.If I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act.And an act hath three branches.It is, to act, to do, to perform.Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.
Give me leave.
Here lies the water, good.Here stands the man, good.If the man go to this water, and
drown himself, it is, will he,
nill he, he goes, mark you that.But if the water come to him and
drown him, he drowns not himself.Argal, he that is not guilty of his
own death shortens not his own life.Cudgel thy brains no more about it.Go, get thee to Yaughan.Fetch me a stoup of liquor.# In youth, when I did love,
did love# Methought it was very sweet... #Has this fellow no
feeling of his business,
that he sings at grave-making?Custom hath made it in him a
property of easiness. Tis e'en so.That skull had a tongue in it,
and could sing once.How the knave jowls it to the
ground, as if it were Cain's
jaw-bone, that did the first murder!It might be the
pate of a politician,one that would circumvent God,
might it not? It might, my lord.And now my Lady Worm's,chapless,and knocked about the mazzard
with a sexton's spade.Here's fine revolution,
an' we had the trick to see't.There's another.Why, may not that be
the skull of a lawyer?Where be his quiddities now,his quillets, his tricks?Why does he suffer this rude knave
now to knock him about the sconce
with a dirty shovel,and will not tell him
of his action of battery? Eh?I'll speak to this fellow.Whose grave's this, sirrah?Mine, sir.# O, a pit of clay for to be made# For such a guest is meet... #I think it be thine,
indeed, for thou liest in't.Thou lie out of it, sir,
and therefore it is not yours.For my part, I do not
lie in't, and yet it is mine.Thou dost lie in't,
to be in't and say it is thine.'Tis for the dead, not for the
quick, therefore thou liest.Tis a quick lie, sir,
'twill away gain, from me to you.What man dost thou dig it for?For no man, sir.What woman, then?For none, neither.Who is to be buried in't?One that was a woman, sir,
but, rest her soul, she's dead.How absolute the knave is!How long hast thou
been a grave-maker?Of all the days i' the year,
I came to't that day that our last
king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.How long is that since?Cannot you tell that?Every fool can tell that.It was the very day that young
Hamlet was born, he that is mad,
and sent into England.Ay, marry,
why was he sent into England?Why, because he was mad.He shall recover his wits there,
or, if he do not, it's
no great matter there. Why?'Twill, a not be seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.How came he mad?
Very strangely, they say.How strangely?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.Upon what ground?
Why, here in Denmark.I have been sexton here,
man and boy, 30 years.How long will a man lie
i' the earth ere he rot?I' faith,
if he be not rotten before he die -as we have many pocky corpses
now a days,that will scarce hold the laying in -he will last you
some eight year or nine year.A tanner will last you nine year.Why he more than another?Why, sir, his hide is so tanned
with his trade,that he will
keep out water a great while,and your water is a sore decayer
of your whoreson dead body.Here's a skull, sir.I've lain you in the earththree and 20 years. Whose was it?A whoreson mad fellow, he was.
Whose do you think it was?Nay, I know not.A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!He poured a flagon of
Rhenish on my head once.This same skull, sir, was
Yorick's skull, the king's jester.This? E'en that. Let me see.Alas, poor Yorick!I knew him, Horatio.A fellow of infinite jest,of most excellent fancy.
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,and now,how abhorred in my
imagination it is!My gorge rises at it.Here hung those lips
that I have kissedI know not how oft.Where be your gibes now?Your gambols? Your songs?Your flashes of merriment, that were
wont to set the table on a roar?Not one now, to mock
your own grinning.Quite chap-fallen.Now get you to my lady's chamber,
and tell her,let her paint an inch thick,to this favour she must come.Make her laugh at that.Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.What's that, my lord?Dost thou think Alexander looked o'
this fashion i' the earth? E'en so.And smelt so? Whoo!
E'en so, my lord.Imperious Caesar,dead and turn'd to clay,Might stop a hole to
keep the wind away.'Twere to consider too
curiously to consider so.Not a jot.BELLS CHIMEHere comes the king.The queen, the courtiers.
Who is this they follow?And with such maimed
rites this doth betokenthe corse they follow did, with
desperate hand, foredo its own life.'Twas of some estate.Couch we awhile, and mark.What ceremony else? That is Laertes.What ceremony else?Her obsequies have been as far
enlarged as we have warranty.Her death was doubtful.And, but that great command
o'ersways the order,she should in ground unsanctified
have lodged till the last trumpet.Must there no more be done?
No more be done.We should profane
the service of the deadto sing a requiem and such rest
to her as to peace-parted souls.Lay her i' the earth.And from her fair and unpolluted
flesh may violets spring!I tell thee, churlish priest,a ministering angel shall my sister
be, when thou liest howling.What, the fair Ophelia!Sweets to the sweet.Farewell!I hoped thou shouldst have
been my Hamlet's wife.I thought thy bride-bed
to have deck'd, sweet maid,not have strew'd thy grave.O, treble woe, fall ten times
treble on that cursed head,whose wicked deed thy most
ingenious sense deprived thee of.Hold off the earth awhile.Till I have caught her
once more in mine arms.Now pile your dust
upon the quick and dead,till of this flat
a mountain you have made,to o'ertop old Pelion,
or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.What is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis?Whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars,and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers?This is I,Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take thy soul!Thou pray'st not well. I prithee,
take thy fingers from my throat.For, though I am not splenitive
and rash, yet have I
something in me dangerous,which let thy wiseness fear.
Hold off thy hand!Pluck them asunder. Hamlet, Hamlet!
Gentlemen. Good my lord, be quiet.Why I will fight with him
upon this theme until my
eyelids will no longer wag.O my son, what theme?I loved Ophelia.Forty thousand brothers could not,
with all their quantity of love,make up my sum.
What wilt thou do for her?O, he is mad, Laertes.For love of God, forbear him.Swounds,
show me what thou'lt do. Woo't weep?Woo't fight? Woo't fast?Woo't tear thyself?Woo't drink up eisel?Eat a crocodile? I'll do't.Dost thou come here to whine?To outface me with
leaping in her grave?Be buried quick with
her, and so will I.And, if thou prate of mountains, let
them throw millions of acres on us,till our ground, singeing his pateagainst the burning zone,
make Ossa like a wart!Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.This is mere madness. And thus
awhile the fit will work on him.Anon, his silence will sit drooping.Hear you, sir.What is the reason
that you use me thus?I loved you ever.But it is no matter.Let Hercules himself do what he may,the cat will mewand dog will have his day.Good Horatio, wait upon him.Strengthen your patience
in our last night's speech.We'll put the matter
to the present push.Good Gertrude,set some watch over your son.There's a divinity
that shapes our ends,rough-hew them how we will.That is most certain.Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are dead.Why, man, they did make love
to this employment, they
are not near my conscience.Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, think'st thee,
stand me now upon?He that hath kill'd my
king and whored my mother,popp'd in between the
election and my hopes,thrown out his angle
for my proper life,and with such cozenage is't not
perfect conscience,
to quit him with this arm?But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
that to Laertes I forgot myself.For, by the image of my cause,
I see the portraiture of his.I'll court his favours.But, sure, the bravery of his grief
did put me into a towering passion.Peace! who comes here? Your lordship
is right welcome back to Denmark.I humbly thank you, sir.Dost know this water-fly?
No, my lord.Thy state is the more gracious,
for 'tis a vice to know him.'Tis a chough.Sweet lord, if your lordship were
at leisure, I should impart a
thing to you from his majesty.I will receive it, sir,
with all diligence of spirit.Put your bonnet to his right
use, 'tis for the head.I thank your lordship,
it is very hot.No, believe me, 'tis very cold.
The wind is northerly.It is indifferent cold,
my lord, indeed.But yet methinks it is very
sultry and hot for my complexion.Exceedingly, my lord,
it is very sultry, as 'twere,
I cannot tell how.But, my lord, his majesty bade
me signify to you that he has
laid a great wager on your head.Sir, this is the matter.
I beseech you, remember.Nay, good my lord,
for mine ease, in good faith.Sir, here is newly come to court
Laertes,believe me, an absolute gentleman,
full of most excellent differences,of very soft society
and great showing.Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,
he is the card
or calendar of gentry,for you shall find in him
the continent of what
part a gentleman would see.The concernancy, sir?
Why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?Sir? What imports the
nomination of this gentleman?Of Laertes? Of him, sir.I know you are not ignorant.I would you did, sir.
Yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not much approve me. Well, sir?You are not ignorant of
what excellence Laertes is.I dare not confess that,
lest I should compare with him in
excellence, but, to know a man well,were to know himself.I mean, sir, for his weapon.
But in the imputation laid on him by
them, in his meed he's unfellowed.What's his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.That's two of his weapons but, well.The king, sir, hath wagered
with him six Barbary horses
against the which he has imponed,as I take it, six French rapiers
and poniards, with their assigns,
as girdle, hangers, and so.Three of the carriages, in faith,
are very dear to fancy,
very responsive to the hilts,most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.What call you the carriages?The carriages, sir, are the hangers.But, on. Why is this
""imponed"", as you call it?The king, sir, hath laid,that in a dozen passes between
yourself and him,
he shall not exceed you three hits.It would come to immediate
trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.How if I answer no?I mean, sir, the opposition
of your person in trial.Sir, I will walk here in the hall
if it please his majesty.'Tis the breathing time of day with
me, I will win for him an I can,if not, I will gain nothing
but my shame and the odd hits.Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?To this effect, sir, after
what flourish your nature will.I commend my duty to your lordship.Yours, yours.This lapwing runs away
with the shell on his head.He did comply with his mother's dug,
before he sucked it.You will lose this wager, my lord.I do not think so.
Since he went into France,
I have been in continual practise.I shall win at the odds.But thou wouldst not think how
ill all's here about my heart.But it is no matter.
Nay, good my lord.It is but foolery. If your
mind dislike any thing, obey it.I will forestall their repair
hither, and say you are not fit.Not a whit.We defy augury.There's a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.If it be now, 'tis not to come.If it be not to come,
it will be now.If it be not now,yet it will come.The readiness is all.Come, Hamlet, come,
and take this hand from me.Give me your pardon, sir.
I've done you wrong.But pardon't,
as you are a gentleman.This presence knows,
and you must needs have heard,how I am punish'd
with sore distraction.What I have done, that might your
nature, honour and exception roughly
awake, I here proclaim was madness.Sir, in this audience, let
my disclaiming from a purposed evilfree me so far
in your most generous thoughts,that I have shot mine arrow o'er
the house, and hurt my brother.I am satisfied.I do receive your offer'd love
like love, and will not wrong it.I do embrace it freely.And will this brother's wager
frankly play. Give us the foils.
Come on. Come, one for me.I'll be your foil, Laertes,
in mine ignorance.Your skill shall, like a
star i' the darkest night,
stick fiery off indeed.You mock me, sir.No, by this hand.Give them the foils, young Osric.Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?Very well, my lord. Your grace hath
laid the odds o' the weaker side.I do not think it.
I have seen you both.But since he is better'd,
we have therefore odds.This is too heavy,
let me see another.This likes me well enough.These foils have all a length?
Ay, my good lord.If Hamlet give
the first or second hit,or quit in answer
of the third exchange,let all the battlements
their ordnance fire.The king shall drink to
Hamlet's better breath.And in the cup
an union shall he throw,richer than that which four
successive kings
in Denmark's crown have worn.APPLAUSELet the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without,the cannon to the heavens,
the heavens to earth, now the king
drinks to Hamlet. Come, begin.And you, the judge, bear a wary eye.Come on, sir. Come, my lord.
No, judgment!A hit, a very palpable hit.Well, again.
Stay. Give me the drink.Hamlet, this pearl is thine.Here's to thy health.Give him the cup.I'll play this bout first,
set it by awhile.Another hit - what say you?
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
Our son shall win.He's hot, and scant of breath.Here, Hamlet, take my napkin,
rub thy brows. The queen
carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.Good madam! Gertrude,do not drink.I will, my lord.I pray you, pardon me.It is the poison'd cup.It is too late. I dare not
drink yet, madam, by and by.Come, let me wipe thy face.My lord, I'll hit him now.
I do not think't.And yet
'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.Come, for the third,
Laertes, you but dally.I pray you, pass with
your best violence.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.Say you so? Come on.Nothing, neither way.Have at you now!Nay, come, again.My lord! My lord!My lord! My lord, my lord!They bleed on both sides. How is
it, my lord? How is't, Laertes?Why, as a woodcock to mine own
springe, Osric, I am justly
kill'd with mine own treachery.How does the queen?
She swounds to see them bleed.No, no, the drink, the drink.O, my dear Hamlet.The drink, the drink!I am poison'd.O villany!How?Let the door be lock'd.
Treachery! Seek it out.It is here, Hamlet.Hamlet, thou art slain.No medicine in the world can
do thee good, in thee there
is not half an hour of life.The treacherous instrument is in
thy hand, unblunted and envenom'd.The foul practise
hath turn'd itself on me.Lo, here I lie,never to rise again.
Thy mother's poison'd.I can no more.The king, the king's to blame.O, yet defend me, friends.
I am but hurt.Here,thou incestuous,
murderous, damned Dane.Drink off this potion.Is thy union here?Follow my mother.He is justly served,
it is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me,
noble Hamlet.Mine and my father's
death come not upon thee,Nor thine on me.Heaven make thee free of it!I follow thee.I am dead, Horatio.Wretched queen, adieu!You that look pale
and tremble at this chance,that are but mutes
or audience to this act,had I but time
as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest,O, I could tell you.But let it be.Horatio, I am dead.Thou livest.Report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied.Never believe it. I am more
an antique Roman than a Dane.Here's yet some liquor left.As thou'rt a man,
give me the cuplet! Let go.
By heaven, I'll have't.O, good Horatio,what a wounded name.Things standing thus unknown,
shall live behind me!If thou didst everhold me in thy heart,absent thee from felicity awhile,and in this harsh worlddraw thy breath in pain,to tell my story.The rest...is silence.Now cracks a noble heart.Good night, sweet prince,and flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest."

I don't know that yet.And in a way,
I'm dead already.Look at me:
jerking off in the shower.This will be the high point of my day.
It's all downhill from here.That's my wife, Carolyn.See the way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs?- That's not an accident.
- [Dog Barking][Man]
Hush, Bitsy!- Hush. What is wrong with you?
- That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.- And that's his lover, Jim.
- [Both Arguing]- You spoil her.
Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me?- Come on. Yes. Inside.

That color!I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this?Well, l'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.- I've never heard that.
- Man, I get exhausted just watching her.She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.We used to be happy.My daughter Jane.
Only child.- Janie's a pretty typical teenager:

to pass, but I don't want to lie to her.[Horn Honking]Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?- Yes.
- Congratulations.
You've succeeded admirably.Lester, could you make me
a little later, please,
because I'm not quite late enough.[Mutters, Indistinct]Nice going, Dad.[Lester Narrating] Both my wife and

Thank you!Hey, Les.
You got a minute?For you, Brad,
I got five!So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.Oh, sure.
Times are tight.You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.- Right?
- Exactly.Like the time that Mr. Flournoy
used the company MasterCard
to pay for that hooker,and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the St. Regis for,
what was it, three months?- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000.
That's somebody's salary.That's somebody who's going
to get fired because Craig
has to pay women to fuck him!Jesus!I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.- [Scoffs]
- That's why we're having everyone...write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.That way management
can assess who's valuable...And who's expendable.It's just business.I've been writing
for this magazine for 14 years.- You've been here how long?
A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.I'm trying to level with you.This is your one chance
to save your job.[Carolyn] There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.- [Lester] You don't think
it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.- But you don't want to be unemployed.

and work for Satan 'cause
it's more convenient that way.Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?So, we finally
got new neighbors.You know, if the Lomans
had let me represent them

have sat on the market for six months.Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.Their sycamore?
Come on.A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.You know that.

It was spectacular.Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?They've hired
this efficiency expert,this really friendly guy
named Brad...How perfect is that?
And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...in firing somebody,
because they couldn't just come
out and say that, could they?No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us...[Chuckling] You couldn't

is to live that image.Honey, do me a favor and say
whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.All right.
Hi, Shirley!Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.- [High Voice] I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!- Buddy! Buddy! Hi!
- Hi.Good to see you again.- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.Oh, we've met before,
actually. This thing last year.
Christmas at the Sheraton.Oh, yeah!Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.Honey, don't be weird.- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.l'll be whatever
you want me to be.Well, oka...- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.[Sighs]Well, I don't know about you guys,

Shrieking With Laughter][Groaning]Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood

I just moved in the house next to you.Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.Hi, Lester Burnham.- Do you party?
- Excuse me?Do you get high?You know, I probably wouldn't
even tell you this if I weren't
a little tipsy, but...I'm in complete awe of you.I mean, your firm...is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,and your personal
sales record is...[Clicks Tongue, Sighs]
It's very intimidating.You know, I'd love to sit down
with you and just pick your brain,- [Chuckles]
- If you'd ever be willing.You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,but I mean, hey,
I don't flatter myself...that I'm even
in the same league as you.I don't.I'd love to.- Really?
- Absolutely.Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.l'll do that.
Thank you.[Lester] Did you ever see that movie
where the body is walking around...carrying its own head, and then
the head goes down on that babe?- [Both Laughing]
- [Ricky] Re-Animator.[Both Continue Laughing]- [Both Stop Laughing]
- Look.I'm not paying you to do whatever
it is you're doing out here.Fine. So don't pay me.Excuse me?I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now leave me alone.Asshole.I think you just
became my personal hero.Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 16...Eighteen. I just do
these gigs as a cover.I have other sources of income.But my dad interferes less
in my life when I pretend...to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.[Carolyn]
Lester?- What are you doing?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.[Wheezing Laugh]
This is Ricky Fitts.[Continues Laughing Hysterically]I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved

Let's go up to my room.I should say hi
to your dad.I don't want to be rude.Nice suit.You're looking good,
Mr. Burnham.Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.Ooh, is that root beer?I love root beer,
don't you?- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.- Hi.
- Remember Angela?Yes, of course.I forgot to tell you. She's going
to spend the night. Is that okay?[Coughing, Choking]- [Jane] Sorry about my dad.
- [Angela]
Don't be. I think it's funny.Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- Shut up.[Angela] He is. If he just
worked out a little, he'd be hot.- Shut up!
- Come on.Like you've never sneaked a peek
at him in his underwear?
I bet he's got a big dick.[Jane Laughing]
You are so grossing me out right now.[Angela] If he built up his chest
and arms, I would totally fuck him.- @ La, la, la, la, la, la @
- I would. I would suck
your dad's big fat dick,and then I'd fuck him until
his eyes rolled back in his head.- [Rattling]
- Jane, shh. What was that noise?- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.- No, I'm serious.
- [Rattling]See?- Oh, my God. Jane.
- What is it?It's that psycho next door.Jane, what if he worships you?What if he's got a shrine
with pictures of you surrounded
by dead people's heads and stuff?Shit. I bet
he's filming us right now.Really?[Clattering]Welcome to
America's Weirdest Home Videos.- [Knocking]
- [Frank] Ricky?Coming, Dad.You know I don't like
locked doors in my house, boy.- I'm sorry.
I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.[Ricky]
So what's up?I... I need a urine sample.Wow.It's been six months already.Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.Yeah. I suppose.Y-You know...Well, good night, son.[Water Dripping]I've been waiting for you.You've been working out,
haven't you?I can tell.I was hoping you could
give me a bath.I'm very, very dirty.What are you doing?Nothing.- You were masturbating.
- [Whispers] I was not.Yes, you were.Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.You know, saying ""hi""
to my monster.That's disgusting.Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.- So do I.
- Really?Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.[Grunts]
Lester, I refuse to live like this!This is not a marriage.This hasn't been
a marriage for years,but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.Well, guess what.
I've changed.And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.I'm not? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.Don't you mess
with me, mister.I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.On what grounds?I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!But... I did support you
when you got your license.And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.Oh!So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay?[Lester Narrating] It's a great thing
when you realize you still have...the ability
to surprise yourself.Makes you wonder what else you can do
that you've forgotten about.Hey, guys.Lester. I didn't know you ran.- I just started.
- Good for you.I figured you guys might be
able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...increased strength
and flexibility as well?I... I want
to look good naked.[Squeaking]Oh, what is this?

- Yeah!You want to borrow it?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.I don't think my dad would try
to come in while someone else
is here, but you never know.- What is this?
- Urine.I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.It's not mine.One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.You like Pink Floyd?I like a lot of music.Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.How much do you want?I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?This is totally decent,

a completely mellow high. No paranoia.Is that what we smoked
last night?This is all I ever smoke.- How much?
- Two grand.Jesus!Things have changed since 1973.- You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.There's a card in there
with my beeper number.Beep me anytime, day or night.And I only accept cash.Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.God. When I was your age,
I flipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eight-track.- That sucks.

How Green Was My Valley|1941|91|Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, Donald Crisp, Roddy McDowall|John Ford|"[Men's Choir Singing in Welsh][Church Bell Ringing]I am packing my belongingsin the shawl my mother
used to wear when
she went to the market,and I am going from my valley,and this time,
I shall never return.I am leaving behind me
my 50 years of memory.Memory.Strange that the mind will
forget so much of what only
this moment has passedand yet hold clear and bright
the memory of what
happened years ago,of men and women
long since dead.Yet who shall say what is real
and what is not?Can I believe
my friends all gonewhen their voices
are still a glory
in my ears?No, and I will stand
to say no and no again,for they remain
a living truth
within my mind.There is no fence
nor hedge 'round time
that is gone.You can go back and have
what you like of itif you can remember.So I can close my eyes
on my valley as it is today,and it is gone,
and I see it as it was
when I was a boy.Green it was
and possessed of
the plenty of the earth.In all Wales,
there was none so beautiful.Everything I ever
learnt as a small boy
came from my father,and I never found
anything he ever told me
to be wrong or worthless.The simple lessons
he taught me are as sharp
and clear in my mindas if I had heard them
only yesterday.In those days, the black slag,
the waste of the coal pits,had only begun to cover
the side of our hill,not yet enough to mar
the countrysidenor blacken the beauty
of our village,for the colliery
had only begunto poke its skinny black
fingers through the green.I can hear even now the voice
of my sister Angharad.âª Huw âªâª Angharad âªCoal miners were my father
and all my brothers,and proud of their trade.Gwilym Morgan, Â£3 and 7.Thank you, sir.Lanto Morgan, Â£3 and 7.Ivor Morgan, Â£3 and 7.Davy Morgan, Â£2 and 5.Owen Morgan, Â£2 and 5.Young Gwilym Morgan,
Â£1 and 10.Someone would
strike up a song,and the valley would ring
with the sound of many voices,for singing is in my people
as sight is in the eye.[Whistle Blows][Singing in Welsh]Then came the scrubbing
out in the back yard.It was the duty
of my sister Angharadto bring the buckets
of hot water and cold,and I performed
what little tasks I could,as my father and brothers
scrubbed the coal dust
from their backs.Most would come off them,
but some would stay for life.This is the honorable badge
of the coal miner,and I envied it on my father
and grown-up brothers.Scrub and scrub,Mr. Coal would lie
there and laugh at you.Aah!Oh!There was always
a baron of beefor a shoulder or leg of lamb
before my father.There was never any talk
while we were eating.I never met anybody
whose talk was better
than good food.My mother
was always on the run,always the last
to start her dinner
and the first to finish,for if my father
was the head of our house,
my mother was its heart.After dinner, when dishes
had been washed,the box was brought
to the tablefor the spending money
to be handed out.No one in our valley
had ever seen a bank.We kept our savings
on the mantelpiece.My father used to say
that money was made
to be spent,just as men
spend their strength
and brains in earning it,and as willingly,but always with a purpose.Thank you, Dada.Ha ha ha!Out of the house
and across the street,as I had run
a hundred times before.[Bell Ringing]Softly now, for respect
for chapel was the first
thing my father taught us.Then straight to Mrs. Tossall,the shop for that toffee
which you could
chew for hours,it seems to me now,and even after
it had gone down,you could swallow
and still find the taste of ithiding behind your tongue.It is with me now,
so many years later.[Doorbell Rings]It makes me think of
so much that was goodthat is gone.It was on this afternoon
that I first saw Bron...Bronwyn.She had come over
from the next valleyfor her first call
on my father and mother.Is this Gwilym
Morgan's house?You must be Huw.Is that you, Bronwyn?Yes.There is lovely you are.I think I fell in love
with Bronwyn then.Perhaps it is foolish to think
a child could fall in love,but I am the child that was,and nobody knows
how I felt,
except only me.I am so proud for Ivor.I'm the one
to be proud.You think well
of our Ivor?Ha ha ha!It seems only
a few months since he was
scratching around herelike this one
with his mouth open.This is Bronwyn, Huw,
who's to be your sister.We have met already.Be careful of the basket.
There's shortcake in it.This is not for you, Huw.
You will have your time
to come.Run along.[Singing in Welsh]Oh!Bronwyn and Ivor were
to be married by the new
preacher, Mr. Gruffydd,who had come from
the university at Cardiff.This was my first
sight of him.[Singing in Welsh][Bell Ringing]Yay!
Yay![Laughter][Laughter Stops]Oh!âª Now, here's a man
won't get drunk âªâª Can't get drunk,
shan't get drunk âªâª Here's a man
won't get drunk âªâª Peter O'Pea âªâª From my heel to my toe
from my toe to my knee âªâª I'll walk the line,
jog the line... âªâª Oh, P... âªOhh.Good evening,
Mr. Morgan.Yes, indeed, sir.Oh, excuse me.Thank you.Ahh.[Singing in Welsh]Come now, boys.
Back to work.Ivor, find Dai Griffiths
and Idris Johnand bring them
to Mr. Evans' office.Will we come with you?No. This is
for the older men.Home to your mother.But...Leave it now, Davy.Well, come! Come!Why aren't you washed?We were waiting for you.The cut is only
a few shillings.There will still be
plenty for all of us.A bit of supper now,
is it, girl?It is because
they are not getting
the old price for coal.Come and wash now.May... May we
speak first, sir?Yes.They did not give the
real reason for this cut.We've been expecting itsince the ironworks
at Dowlais closed.What have the ironworks
to do with us?Their men came to the colliery
willing to work for any wage,so our wages
must come down.And this is only
the beginning.Watch now, they'll cut us
again and still again,until they have this,as empty
as their promises.Nonsense. A good worker
is worth good wages,and he will get them.
Not while
there are three menfor every job.Why should owners pay
more if men are willing
to work for less?Because the owners
are not savages.They are men,
like us.Men, yes,
but not like us.Would they deal with you
when you went to them?No.They have power,
and we have none.How will we get power,
from the air?No. From a union
of all the men.Union, is it?I never thought
I'd hear my own sons
talking socialist nonsense.But it's sense,
good sense!Unless
we stand together...I've had enough
of this talk!But, Father, it d...Come and wash now.Your good mother
will be waiting.Do you think I'll let them
make my father stand
like a dog in the rainand not raise
my hands to stop it?Hisht, Davy.Who gave you
permission to speak?This is too important
for silence.They're trying
to punish you...It is not more important
than good manners.What are we
going to do?You'll die of the cold
when it comes to snow.Let us stand together
and see how they act then.Right. The men will come
if we say the word.
All the pits are ready.You will not make me
a plank for your politics.I will not be
the excuse
for any strike.If they can do
things like that
to the spokesman,what will they try
and do to the men?We will see.
Be silent now.
Finish your supper.But, Father...
Enough now!But...
On with your work.It is not enough!Owen! Hold your tongue until
you have permission to speak!I will speak against
injustice anywhere,
with permission or without it.Not in this house.In this house
and outside, sir.Leave the table.I will leave the house.Gwil! Tell your
father you're sorry.I'm not sorry.I am with you. We can find
lodgings in the village.Gwilym.All of you, then?For the last time,
sit down,
finish your supper.I will say no more.We are not questioning
your authority, sir,but if manners prevent
our speaking the truth,we will be without manners.Get your clothes and go.I am going with them
to look after them.Hold your tongue, girl!
Get on with your dishes![Clink]Ah-choo!Yes, my son.
I know you are there.The men have struck.[Bells Ringing]What does it mean,
Mr. Gruffydd?It means thatsomething has gone
out of this valley
that may never be replaced.Home to your
father and mother, boy.
They'll need you today.22 weeks the men
were out, as the strike
moved into winter.It was strange to go
out into the streetand find the men there
in the daytime.It had a feeling
of fright in it,and always the mood of
the men grew uglier,as empty bellies
and desperationbegan to conquer reason.Any man who was
not their friendbecame their enemy.They knew that my father
had opposed the strike,and now it was they
who opposed him.[Glass Breaks][Smack]Huw,
there's a meeting of the men
in the hills tonight, is it?Yes, Mama.
You will take me there.Oh, no, Mama.
It is no place
for women.There's a place
for this woman
there tonight,upon my soul.Wait, wait till you hear me.I am Beth Morgan,
as you damn well know.I have come to tell you
what I think of you allbecause you're talking
against my husband!You're a lot of cowards
to go against him!He would do
nothing against you,
and you know it well!How some of you,
you smug-faced hypocrites,can sit in the same chapel
with him I cannot tell.To say he's with the owners
is not only nonsense,but downright wickedness!There's one thing
more I've got to say,
and it is this,if harm comes to my Gwilym,
I'll find out the men,and I will kill them
with my two hands,and this I will swear
by God Almighty![Murmuring]Lanto, help!Help!Help! Help!Hold on, Mama!
They've heard us!
They're coming!Ahh.He was awake just now.Shh.He'll do, then.But it's beyond me
to say why!You're breeding horses
in this family, Mr. Morgan.Ha!This boy should be in
his coffin, for my part.He's a Morgan,
then, is it, sir?Eh.He should be fed
now, Mrs. Ivor,a little soup
and some warm smile.Ahhh.Yes.Ah!Horse!Well, good day.
Wait, wait, wait.Huw was awake.
He spoke to Bron.How long for
the little one?It's hard to tell.His legs were frozen
to the bone.A year,
two year like that,but I can't promise
he'll ever walk again!Nature must
take her course!Mind your tongue!I think he heard you.Where is the light
I thought to see in your eye?Are you afraid, boy?Hmm?You heard what
the doctor said?Yes, sir.And you believed it?Yes, sir.You want to walk again,
don't you?Yes, sir.Then you must have faith,and if you have,
you will walk againno matter what
all the doctors say.But he said nature
must take her course.""Nature is
the handmaiden
of the Lord.""I remember one
or two occasionswhen she was given orders
to change her course.You know your
scriptures, boy.Yes, sir.Then you know that
what's been done beforecan be done again,
for you.Do you believe me, Huw?Yes, sir.Good.You will see
the first daffodil
out on the mountain.Will you?Indeed I will, sir.Then you will.I could almost wishthat I were lying
there in your place,if it meant
reading this book again
for the first time.Treasure Island.Mr. Gruffydd?I couldn't let you go
without thanking you.It was only my duty, girl.No. It was more than duty.Yes, Huw's a fine boy,
and you're a fine family.Um, you'd better be
going in now. You'll
catch your death.Yes.Will you be
coming to supper soon?Uh, yes, later,when you're finished
with doctors and such, huh?I will hurry them away, then.Good.""Squire Trelawney,
Dr. Livesey,""and the rest
of these gentlemen,having asked me to write down
the whole particulars
about Treasure Islandfrom the beginning
to the end,keeping nothing back but
the bearings of the island,and that only because
there is still treasure
not yet lifted,I take up my pen
in the year of grace 1785,and go back to the timewhen my father kept
the Admiral Benbow Inn...""All the noble books
which have lived in
my mind ever since,and always I hoped
and kept my faith.For the first months,my mother was still upstairs,and we could talk
to each other with tappings.[Chirp][Huw Whistling][Cackling]Spring?There you are, girl.Easy.There you are.Wait.It's the old snow got into it.[Singing in Welsh]Oh, Gwilym.There is a wife you have,resting in her bed
and letting strangers
care for her family.There is a wife
I have, then.Go along with you, boy.[Singing in Welsh]Will you say something,
Mother?Go on. Say something.But what...
What'll I say?You found plenty to say
the last time you spoke.It should be easier now,
with friends.Well...Well, come and eat,
everyone.Smoke is it, boys.Lanto.I haven't seen you
in chapel lately.I have been too busy.What business,
may I ask?Mine.Only asking
a civil question, I was.And having
a civil answer.I have been busy
with the union.Unions are the work
of the devil.You will come
to no good end.At least
I am not sitting on it,
talking rubbish in chapel.Look here...
Oh, leave it,or I'll say something
to be sorry.This is a matter
that requires airing.Lanto, why do you think
we at the chapel talk rubbish?My remark was
not aimed at you.Then aim it.Very well.Because you make
yourselves out to be
shepherds of the flock,and yet you allow your sheep
to live in filth and poverty,and if they try
and raise their
voices against it,you calm them by telling
them their suffering
is the will of God.Sheep, indeed.Are we sheep to be
herded and sheared
by a handful of owners?I was taught man
was made in the image
of God, not a sheep.I haven't expressed
my views around herebecause I haven't had
any wish to interfere
in a family disagreement.You have
my permission
to speak.Very well, then.
Here is what I think.First, have your union.You need it.Alone, you are weak.
Together, you're strong.But remember
that with strength
goes responsibility,to others
and yourselves,for you cannot conquer
injustice with more injustice,only with justice
and the help of God.Are you coming outside
your position in life,
Mr. Gruffydd?Your business
is spiritual.My business is anything
that comes between man
and the spirit of God.The deacons shall hear
that you've been
preaching socialism!Mr. Parry!Loose the old devil's teeth!He is our guest!Beth, a pint
of home brew
for Mr. Parry.I'll give him a clout
with a frying pan!Oh!Miss Jenkins!
A sweet song!
The harp, is it?Come on, men.
Get in here.Now, look.
A little song...Angharad.Mr. Gruffydd,
will we always be
in your debt,now you have made
us a family again?Here. Let me.Oh, your hands.There's a pity.No matter.Have you ever been
down the collieries?10 years.10 years?While I was studying.A bit of soap now.Oh, don't bother,
please.There's a man
for you, spoiling
his good handkerchief.Look, now,
you are king
in the chapel,but I will be queen
in my own kitchen.You will be queen
wherever you walk.What does that mean?I should not
have said it.Why?I have no right
to speak to you so.Mr. Gruffydd?If the right is mine to give,you have it.[Horn Blowing]Then the strike was settled,with the help
of Mr. Gruffydd
and my father.Work again,work to wipe out the memory
of idleness and hardship.The men were happy going
up the hill that morning.1 and 9.

to live this day.I give thanks for all I have,and I do give thanks
for this new blessing,for you are our father,but we look to our
queen as our mother.Comfort her in her
troubles, oh God,and let her worries be
not more than she shall
bear at her age,and grant that sweetness
and power and spiritmay be given to these
voices that shall sing
at her command.Amen.Amen.
Amen.[Bell Rings]âª God save our

dear Mr. Gruffydd.
There is good to see you.Angharad is
at the market.Angharad?
Oh, I've come for Huw.For Huw?The daffodils
are out, Mama.Where are your
clothes, boy?Under my pillow.Your pillow?For these months,
ready for today.Come then, and you shall bring
back a posy fit for a queenfor your brave mother.Indeed I will, sir.Almost there, Huw.Yes, sir.Low bridge there.
Watch out.It's fine.All right.Ha ha!All right?Yes, sir.Easy it is, now.There.Cwm Rhondda.But, Mr. Gruffydd...You can walk,
Huw, if you try.Come, lad.
You can walk.Huw! Walk!There's a good lad.Come on.See? Ha ha!There's a good old man.You've been lucky, Huw.Lucky to suffer,lucky to spend these
weary months in bed.For so God has
given you a chanceto make spirit
within yourself,and as your father
cleans his lamp
to have good light,so keep clean
your spirit, huh?How, sir?By prayer, Huw.And by prayer,
I don't mean
shouting and mumblingand wallowing like a hog
in religious sentiment.Prayer is only
another name for good,
clean, direct thinking.When you pray, think.Think well
what you're saying.Make your thoughts into
things that are solid,and that way,
your prayer will
have strength,and that strength will
become a part of you,body, mind,
and spirit.And the first duty
of these new legsis to get you
to chapel on Sunday.Indeed they will, sir.There's a good
old man again.Give me your hand.Come on now.[Ringing][Choir Singing]Will you please
remain in your places?There's to be
a meeting
of the deacons.Ceinwen Lewis!Step forward!Your sins have
found you out!And now you must
pay the price of
all women like you.You have brought
a child into the world
against the Commandment!Prayer is wasted
on your sort!You shall be cast out
into the outer darknesstill you have
learned your lesson!Ceinwen Lewis,
do you admit your sin?Yes.Then prepare to suffer
your punishment!Stop it!Angharad!Leave her alone,
you hypocrite!Sit down, Mr. Morgan.
You...Sit down![Sobbing]How could you stand
there and watch them?Cruel old men
groaning and nodding
to hurt her more.That is not
the word of God.""Go thou,
and sin no more,""
Jesus said!Angharad!You know your Bible
too well, life too little.I know enough of life
to know that Ceinwen Lewisis no worse than I am.
Angharad!What do the deacons know?What do you know
about what could
happen to a poor girlwhen she loves
a man so muchthat to lose sight of him
for a moment is torture?Does that hurt you, Huw?Easy, now.Huw?Angharad. Angharad!I am a man now!
Kindly leave the kitchen!Oh, so you're
a man now, is it?Ow!Ha ha ha!Hey! Hey!Blasphemy, sacrilege,
and hypocrisy!Can't a man smoke
his pipe and read his
paper on the sabbath?Oh, go and
blow your nose![Knock on Door]Come in![Knock Knock]Come in![Knock Knock]What under the blaz...Good morning, Morgan.Good morning, Mr. Evans.Sit down, sir.
Sit down, sir.Oh. Thank you.Mr. Evans.The mine owner himself.Angharad.Ahh.Now to business, Morgan.Yes, sir.Uh...I've come here on a very
delicate mission, Morgan.No trouble, sir?No, no, no. No trouble,
but it worries me.Yes, sir.I'm here to get
your permissionthat my son lestynmay have permission...Ah-choo!Bless you, Morgan.Thank you, sir.Now, where was I?Permission.Oh, yes. That my son lestyn
may have permission,with your
daughter's permission,
to call upon her.There we are.We are a very proud
family, Mr. Evans.Yes, yes, I know,
I know, Morgan,but this is not
my doing, Morgan.It's that young boy...Mr. Evans, your son
has my permissionto speak to me.Thank you.
Thank you, Morgan.I'm very much
obliged to you.Yes, sir. Yes, sir.Good old Welsh blood,
you know, and all that
sort of thing.I'm very much
obliged, Morgan.Yes, sir. Yes, sir.Good day, Morgan.Beth! Beth!Come, come, come.
My shoes. Get my shoes.You, girl,
get up to your room.Have you no modesty
left in you? Get up there.Take your hand out...
My shoes! Find the shoes!Why don't you get
your jackets on?
Get your...[Knock on Door]Mr. Morgan.Sit down.This is my wife
Mrs. Morgan.How do you do?Mr. Morgan,
I've come to ask
your permissionto speak to your
daughter Angharad.These are my sons.Yes. I know them.Ah-choo!God bless you.
God bless you.[Clock Strikes 9:00]You shouldn't be here.I couldn't spend another
night without knowing.What has happened?
Is anything wrong?Wrong?You know what I mean.Why have you
changed towards me?Why am I a stranger now?Have I done anything?No.The blame is mine.Your mother spoke
to me after chapel.She's happy to think
you'll be having
plenty all your days.Lestyn Evans.You could do no better.I don't want him!
I want you.Angharad.I have spent nights, too,
trying to think this out.When I took up this work,
I knew what it meant.It meant sacrifice
and devotion.It meant making
it my whole lifeto the...
To the exclusion
of everything else.That I was perfectly
willing to do.But to share it
with another...Do you think
I will have you going
threadbare all your life,depending on
the charity of others
for your good meals,our children growing up
in cast-off clothing,and ourselves
thanking God for parenthood
in a house full of bits?No. I can bear
with such a life for
the sake of my work,but I think
I'd start to killif I saw the white
come to your hair
20 years before its time.Why?Why would you
start to kill?Are you a man
or a saint?I am no saint,but I have a duty
towards you.Let me do it.[Bell Ringing]Is there to be no singing
for my daughter's wedding,
Dai Bando?[Singing in Welsh]Now, then,
the bathtub holds
100 gallons.""A"" fills it at the rate
of 20 gallons a minuteand ""B"" at the rate
of 10 gallons a minute.Got that, Mr. Morgan?20 and 10 gallons.
Yes, sir.Now, then,""C"" is a hole that empties it
at the rate of 5
gallons a minute.How long to fill the tub?Hmm.Ha ha ha!They're silly.Trying to fill a bathtub
full of holes, indeed.A sum it is, girl, a sum,
a problem for the mind,for his examination
into school next month.That old national school,
just silly they are with
their sums.Who would pour water
in a bathtub full of holes?Who would think of it?
Only a madman.It is to see if the boy
can calculate, girl.Figures, nothing else.How many gallons
and how long?In a bathtub
full of holes.Now I know why I have
such a tribe of sons.It is you,
Beth Morgan,
is the cause.Look you, Mr. Gruffydd,
have you something else?The decimal point.The decimal point, then.And peace to my house!Go and scratch.Uh, it's getting late.
I've got to get along.We'll follow
the decimal point
tomorrow night.Yes, sir.
Good night.Good night,
Mrs. Morgan.Good night, Mr. Gruffydd.Who is there that
cannot look backand remember his first day
at a new school?To go alone the long
walk over the hillsto the next valley,the first of my family
to have the privilegeof attending
a national school.So you're the new boy?Yes, sir.
You're late.Yes, sir.What a dirty
little sweep it is.[Laughter]Who are your people?Where are you from?Cwm Rhondda.Cwm Rhondda?Oh, a little genius
from the coal pits,and they expect me to
make a scholar of it.All right, come in.Were you
brought up in stables?[Laughter]Well, shut the door.[Laughter]Your boots are muddy.They were clean
when I left home.You will address me
as sir, or I'll put
a stick about your back.Now, sit down here.Yes, sir.Ha ha ha![Laughter]Come here,
you dirty little sweep.What have we here?A pencil box.Pretty, too.Hey, you broke
my pencil box![Shrieking]Mervyn, Mervyn, stop it!
You'll hurt him!Hit him! Hit him!I... I fell
on the mountain.Did you win, Huw?No.Lanto!Fetch Dai Bando.Dai Bando, is it?Are you willing to go
to school tomorrow?Yes, sir.
Good.From tonight,
you shall get a penny for
every mark on your face,sixpence for a bloody nose,
a shilling for a black eye,and two shillings
for a broken nose.Gwilym, stop it.Fight again,
and when you come home,not another look
will you get from me,not another word.Break your own nose, then.Break your mother's heart.A boy must fight, Beth.Fight? Fight, is it?Another beating like that
and he would walk home dead.Beating?
He's had no beating.A hiding, yes,
but no beating.Give the boy time, it will be
he that's giving the beating,
is it?Dai Bando,
come into the house.Good evening, Mrs. Morgan.
Good Evening, Mrs. Morgan.Leave off your hat.Dai Bando is going
to teach you to box, Huw.To fight first.Too many call themselves
boxers who are not even
fighters.Boxing is an art, is it?It is. It is.Go along with you, girl.
A cup of tea for the men,
is it?Tea?Tea? No tea, Mrs. Morgan.In training, he is.A glass of beer
if you please.Baths full of holes,and now prizefighters.Get him!
Come on!Get him!Come on, get him, Mervyn!Get up! Get up!Hit him!Knock him down, Mervyn!Hit him, Mervyn!Our wild little
coal-mining friend
has been indulgingin his favorite
sport again, eh?Mr. Phillips,
make a back, please.I refuse, sir.Make a back,
Mr. Phillips!
I refuse, sir!Mr. Mills,
make a back.Here. Put this in
between your teeth.Bite it hard.Well, the scholar![Whimpering]Huw!
Lad!I'll go to my death.You got that in school?He's cut you to the bone.
Who was it?Mr. Jonas?We'll have a word
with him.No.Why not?I broke the rule
when I fought.There's no rule
for that.But he warned me.Rubbish, boy!
Wait, Davy.This is Huw's affair.
He shall decide.Say the word, lad,
and we will have the
bones hot from his flesh.No. Leave him alone.I think our baby brother
is becoming quite a man.These denominationsare used in measuring
distances and...Yes?
Right!Good morning,
Mister...Jonas.Mr. Jonas.
Mr. Jonas.We have come to
the right place, indeed.Ha ha ha!What can I
do for you?A man is never
too old to learn,
is it, Mr. Jonas?No.I was in school
myself once,but no great one
for knowledge.Look here,
what do you want?Knowledge.How would you go abouttaking the measurement
of a stick, Mr. Jonas?By its length, of course.And how would you
measure a manwho would use a stick
on a boy 1/3 his size?Tell us.Now, you are good
in the use of a stick,but boxing
is my subject,according to the rules
laid down by the good
Marquis of Queensberry.God rest his soul.And happy I am to pass
on my knowledge to you.Mr. Motshill!All right, get him
into position, now.Now, look,
to make a good boxer,you must have a good
right hand, you see?Now, you see,
that is how you
will punish your man,with a right
and a left.The gentleman
is talking to you.Raise him.Come on, come on.
Up, up, up.Position again.Could I have your attention,
boys and girls?I am not accustomed
to speaking in public.Only public houses.But this, never use.It's against the rules.Break a man's nose.
Now, then...I'm afraid he will
never make a boxer.No aptitude
for knowledge.[Whistle Blowing][Bell Clanging]Mr. Gruffydd!Ivor fell under a tram,
lower level.[Crying]Ivor![Praying in Welsh]We have our first
grandson, Gwil.Give one
and take the other.Tell that to that
girl up there!
She'll have an answer for you.Do not kindle
the wrath.To hell with the wrath!And I'm saying it
plain to be heard.Ah, 'tis good.With honors, then.Our son is a scholar.What is it, Huw?I can't make
sense with it.Latin it is.Latin, is it? Why not good
Welsh or even English?It is the fashion.Fashion.
Frenchies, decimal points,
and bathtubs full of holes.My poor Huw,
they've stuffed
your head with Latin.Beth, my old beauty,
you, a black eye, is it?Go ahead, shout!
Wake up the baby, then.There is beautiful.
The image of my father,
he is.What bloody nonsense.Now then, Huw,
what will it be?To Cardiff to school,
then the universityto be a lawyer,
is it, or a doctor?Dr. Huw Morgan.Well, Uncle Huw,
that will be
something special.Yes, indeed,
with a lovely
horse and trapand a good black suit
and a shirt with starch.Oh, there is good,
my little one.Now then, a glass
of buttermilk for you
with all your knowledge.Yes, Mother,
and some of
Bron's shortcake.Oh, and my shortcake
is to be fed to the pigs,
is it?No, only I finished
yours yesterday.Today is
shortcake day
with Bron.I'm sorry, Huw,
only currant bread
I made today.Nobody to eat it now.Oh, Mother,
I'm lonely without him.I put his boots
and clothes ready
every night,but they're there
still in the morning.There is lonely I am.Gwil, I will have Bron here
to live if she will come.Not Bron.One mistress
in the house.Now, Huw,
what will it be?I will go down
the colliery
with you, sir.Have sense, boy.
The colliery is
no place for you.Why not try for
a respectable job?Respectable?Are you and his brothers
a lot of old jailbirds?Leave it now, Beth.I only want
the best for the boy.If he is as good a man
as you and his brothers,I will rest happy.I'm thinking of
the boy's future.It was different
in our day,there was good money
and fair play for all.But Huw is a scholar.Why take brains
down a coal mine?I would rather, sir.All right.Decide for yourself,but blame yourself
if you are wrong.The colliery, sir.All right.
The colliery it is.Good.Where are you going?To get drunk!Bron?I am going down
the colliery.Oh, the colliery,
is it?The old coal will be
shaking in its seam.Bron...Bro... Bron, would you have me
to live in this houseand have my wages?Your home is
with your mother.It was she who sent me.From pity?No, from sense.If you put clothes
night and morning,let them be
my clothes.Good old man.Yes or no, Bron?Yes.Goo... Good.Good. I will
get my bed.[Singing in Welsh][Whistle Blowing]So it is a man now, is it?And could I carry
such a man?Lanto!Ha ha ha!5 shillings.7 and tuppence.Move along!Thanks.3 shillings.2.09.Â£1.02.Â£2. 10.
Discharged, Morgan.Move along.Â£2. 10.
Discharged, Morgan.Â£1. 10.And so it came
to lanto and Davy,the best workers
in the colliery
but too highly paidto compete with poorer,
more desperate men.[Bell Ringing]Will you read us
a chapter, Father?Yes, my son.""The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.He leadeth me
beside the still waters.He restoreth my soul.He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousnessfor his name's sake.Yea, though I walk
through the valley
of the shadow of death,I will fear no evilfor thou art with me.Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.Thou preparest
a table before mein the presence
of mine enemies.Thou anointest
my head with oil.""[Door Closes]""My cup runneth over.""One line to Owen and Gwil,down to Cape Town to Angharad,over here to Canada to lanto,and down here to Davy
in New Zealand.And you are the star,
shining on them
from this houseall the way
across the continents
and the oceans.All the way?How far am I shining
if you can put it all
on a little piece of paper?Now, a map it is,
my old beauty.A picture of the world
to show you where they are.I know where they are
without any old mapsor scratches
or spiders
or pencils.They are in the house.Then Angharad came
back from Cape Town
without her husband.She did not come to usbut stayed at
the big Evans house,her house on top of the hill.To see Mrs. Evans,
please.Who is it?
Huw Morgan.Her brother, is it?Come in.Why, Huw...Mrs. Nicholas,
will you bring
some tea, please?Sit down, Huw.There is grown you are,and changed.You, too.I look ill and ought
to take care of myself.Everyone coming in
the house says so,so you say it, too,
and let us finish with it.But tell me all the news.How is...How are all the boys
and girls we used to know?Well,the Jenkins girls
are married.Maldwyn Hughes has
gone to be a doctor.Rhys Howell is in
a solicitor's office,and he's sending home
10 shillings a week.And Mr. Gruffydd,is still first up
and last to bed.How is he, Huw?Not as he was.Is he ill?Inside, in his eyesand in his voice.Like you.Please go home, Huw.I'm sorry.Now then, Mrs. Evans.
Tea, is it?Leave it,
Mrs. Nicholas.
I will pour.Well!I always did the pouring
for Mr. Lestyn's poor mother.I will pour.Yes, Mrs. Evans.A new mistress
is like new sheets,yes, a little bit stiff,but washings to come.Why do you
have her here?37 years with the family,
or so she tells me
60 times a day.Have some tea, Huw.You don't
want me to go?No. No, Huw.I'm sorry
for being nasty.Please stay.Oh, Huw!I tried to tell
Mother, but...[Sobbing]Not for me to say.Only the housekeeper I am.37 years in the familyand living to
curse the day!It will not
surprise me any dayto see the old master
rise white from his grave.'Tis only the gravestone
is holding him down,
I will swear.Then what is it,
Mrs. Nicholas?Divorce.Divorce!Saying nothing I am,but that is what
is in her mind.She is here without
her husband, is it?And why?'Tis because
she is in love
with this preacher.Preacher, I said!
Mr. Gruffydd it is.But Mr. Gruffydd has
not been near the house.What difference
is that, girl?Get on with your work!We will not say
a word, Mrs. Nicholas.Oh, no!No, no!Liar! Liar!You're a filthy liar![Jeering and Shouting]You're a filthy liar!Come on!Get him!Come on, Roger!Get him, Roger!Let up!Let me at him!Liar! Liar! Liar!As the slag had spread
over my valley,so now a blackness spread
over the minds of its people.For the first time
in my memory,our front door was shut
tight in the daytime.Dada?Well, Huw,trouble with the
philistines, is it?Huw, what is it now?
Look at your hands.Evan John,he said things
about Angharad
and Mr. Gruffydd.The children, too.You were right, my son.I will be back
for breakfast.You will not
go to chapel?No.And if they
do this thing,I will never set foot
in the chapel again
as long as I live.I will have
the sheets warm
on your bed.There is an old
beauty you are.Go and scratch, boy.What is this about
the chapel, Mother?Tonight after
the service,a deacons' meeting
over Angharad.Angharad?But she has
done nothing.Nothing is enough for people
who have minds like cesspools.Oh, Huw, my little one,I hope when you're grown
their tongues will
be slower to hurt.But will Angharad
have to be
at the meeting?No, none of us
will be there.But the disgrace
will not stay away.I will go, Mother.[Singing in Welsh]This is the last time
I will talk in this chapel.I am leaving the valley
with regrettoward those who
have helped me hereand who have
let me help them.But,for the rest of you,those of you who
have only provedthat I have wasted
my time among you,
I have only this to say.There is not
one among youwho has had
the courage to come to me
and accuse me of wrongdoing.And yet, by any standard,
if there has been a sin,I am the one
who should be
branded the sinner.Will anyone raise
his voice here now
to accuse me?No.You're cowards, too,
as well as hypocrites.But I don't blame you.The fault is mine
as much as yours.The idle tongues,the poverty of mind
which you have shownmean that I have failed
to reach most of youwith the lesson
I was given to teach.Huw?I thought,
when I was a young man,that I would conquer
the world with truth.I thought I would
lead an army greater than
Alexander ever dreamed of,not to conquer nations
but to liberate mankind...Yes, sir....with truthand the golden
sound of the word.But only a few
of them heard.Only a few
of you understood.The rest of you put on
black and sat in chapel!Why do you come here?Why do you dress
your hypocrisy in blackand parade before
your God on Sunday?From love?No.For you've shown
that your hearts
are too witheredto receive the love
of your Divine Father.I know why you've come.I've seen it in your faces
Sunday after Sundayas I've stood
here before you.Fear has brought you here,horrible,
superstitious fear.Fear of divine retribution.A bolt of fire
from the skies,the vengeance of the Lord
and the justice of God.But you have forgotten
the love of Jesus.You disregard
his sacrifice.Death, fear, flames,
horror, and black clothes!Hold your meeting, then.But know if you do
this in the name of God
and in the house of God,you blaspheme against
Him and His word.Wait!There is a meeting,
Master Morgan.Well, Huw.I'm glad you've come.Thank you, sir.Is there
anything I can do?Indeed there is.You can do me
a great service.This watch,my father gave it to me
when I entered the ministry.It's marked time
we both loved.Take it.Oh, no, sir.A service I said
you'd be doing me.No need for us
to shake hands.We will live in
the minds of each other.Mr. Gruffydd,won't you see
Angharad before you go?She wants you to.No.If I were to
see her again,I couldn't find the
strength to leave her.Goodbye, Huw.And there's a good
old man you are.[Whistle Blowing][Crowd Shouting]What is it now?Fire or flood or what?Cave-in, they're saying.Take me up by there.What good in
the darkness of a mine?Your eyes are no longer
good in the daylightfrom the blows you
have taken in the ring.I can still swing a pick
deeper than any man.Take me up there.[Explosion][Whistle Blowing]Bron! Bron! Gwilym!Those of you
with relatives.Let them to the pit.Gwilym Morgan?Not yet, sir.Mr. Gruffydd,
on the lower level he was.[Coughing]My father?Not yet, Mrs. Evans.[Crying][Woman Screams][Crying and Moaning][Church Bell Ringing]Angharad.Who is for Gwilym Morgan
and the others?I, for one.He is the blood
of my heart.Come, Cyfartha.'Tis a coward I am,but I will hold
your coat.[Singing in Welsh]Dada![Echoing] Dada! Dada!Dada!Huw.Lad.Dada! Dada!Dada!Huw.Dada.Mr. Gruffydd!There's a good
old man you are.He came to me just now.Ivor was with him.He spoke to meand told me of
the glory he had seen.Look.[Church Bell Ringing][Singing in Welsh]Men like my father cannot die.They are with me still,real in memory
as they were in flesh,loving and beloved forever.How green was my valley then.[Singing in Welsh][Church Bell Ringing}ENGLISH - US - PSDH"

then ever.Father.My lady, she is the new nurse.This is good breast milk.Hey!
Come on, hurry!And that's how you became my child.I repeat.Prisoners going to their
cells will walk withtheir heads bowed. Keep
your eyes on the ground!No looking forward or to the side!The guards will give you directions
and tell you when to turn!Eyes down! Move!Pu Chieh.Your guest is waiting to meet you,
Your Majesty.Also, your mother has arrived.You have not seen your mother
for many years, Your Majesty.He is so small!He is young, Your Majesty.Go. Go!The Emperor's brother,
His Excellency, Pu Chieh.Ar Mo.Stay with me.How's the health of His
Majesty's mother?It is better, thank you. How
much His Majesty has grown!My mother has not seen me for
seven years!Do you remember my face?No!The night they came with the horses,
I knew it would be like this.My brother sees you every day!Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you.
He often talks about you.We are all very proud of you.The kite.He chose this for you.Papa!Some of my clothes are in these boxes.This is the Imperial row.My capes are in that big box.What is that?My medicines.- Pills for rectifying the vapors.
- Look, a chamber pot.These are my birds.That is my heater,
and this is my camel.They're turning away!Of course! Ordinary people are
not allowed to look at the Emperor!I am too important.Is it true that you can do
whatever you want?Of course, I can. If I am naughty, someone
else is punished. One of them!Stop!The Emperor will walk.I have never met other children.
Are they all like you?I've got three sisters and two friends.If you come to our house,
you can play with us.The Emperor never leaves the
Palace.We play games together!I know a game, too! Run!- The ones in the boat are the high consorts.
- High consorts?The wives of the Emperor
before me.They say they're my mother,
but they're not! They're not!We asked you for the
books, so prisoners willhave to pass this around
or read it aloud.The sooner you begin to learn,
the better. This is a school.History of the new popular democracy.Pages 84, 85.In February 1912,2 000 years of Imperial rule came to an end
with the abdication of the Manchoo Dynasty.China became a republic.It was the year of the Rat.Are you interested in ancient history?School...This is a prison.A real prison.I told you to start reading.You, there, read aloud. Read!AccordingAccordingAccording to the treaty between
the empire and the first republic,the Emperor's taitou was
retained and not abolished.He would retain his palaces, and he paid
an annual subsidy of four million dollars.The republic also guaranteed to protect
the Imperial tombs in perpetuity.In return, the dynasty surrendered forever
its right to rule the country.Man, his nature originally good.Let us see what the
Emperor has done.Your Majesty will do it
again five times.Five times!Ten times.Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow!But this is ordinary yellow.- It is Imperial yellow!
- No, it is not!We say it is! Only the Emperor
can wear that yellow! Take it off!- No!
- Take it off!No! And you're not the Emperor anymore!There is a new Emperor now!He has cut off his queue, and instead of a
camel, he has got a car!What did you say?You're not the Emperor!Liar!You're not the Emperor anymore!Liar! Liar!You're not the...Liar!You're not the Emperor!
How dare you!Calm yourselves! Oh!- You're not the Emperor!
- How dare you!No! Your Majesty!
Calm yourselves!Am I the Emperor or not?Your Majesty will always be the Emperor.- You see?
- Prove it!Big Foot, drink it! Go on, drink
the green ink.I will show you!See? That is a car! He is the
President of the Republic.Why is this wall here, Lord
Chamberlain?It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed.You are lying.High Tutor, am I still the Emperor?You will always be the Emperor inside
the Forbidden City, but not outside.I do not understand.Outside China is now a republic,
with a president.Where is Ar Mo? Ar Mo?You are all liars!- Let me say ""good-bye""!
- Hurry! Hurry!He's my child! Ah!Ar Mo? Ar Mo?I do not understand.I do not understand.Your Majesty is a big boy now.He cannot have a wet nurse anymore.It is much better like this.
Much healthier.But she is not my wet nurse.She's my butterfly.Ar Mo! Ar Mo!Ar Mo! Ar Mo!Ar Mo! Ar Mo!This is the detention center of
the Fushun Bureau of Public Security.And I am the governor!During the war, this was a
Japanese prison.Many of you may remember it.Because you worked with the Japanese,you were responsible for building it,
and you filled it with innocent people.How could this happen?Why did you betray your
country?What turned you into war
criminals?We believe that men are
born good!We believe that the only
way to change is todiscover the truth and
look at it in the face.That is why you are here.You will begin by writing the story of your
lives and by confessing your crimes.Your salvation will lie entirely
in the attitude you take!I advise you to be frank and sincere.Otherwise, things can still
go very badly for you.You have learned that
song very quickly.That is a good beginning.It is snowing.We must stick to the same story, or they
will turn our words against us.After a few years, the tiny republic had
become as corrupt as the old Empire.It fell quickly into the hands of ambitious
generals and corrupt bureaucrats.The era of the warlords had begun. By May
1919, when I received my appointment,China was in turmoil.China awake.Did you know they're now selling
electoral votes on the stock market?Nothing has changed
with the republic,either inside or outside
the Forbidden City.- Except for the bicycles.
- The students are angry.But what can they do
except shout?The shops are closing.Oh, so, they are.Maybe we'll be late after all.Shall we take a short cut?- Yes.
- Use our feet.Remember, you're one of the
first foreigners with anofficial post in the Forbidden
City since Marco Polo.It makes me very nervous.The enemy.Is there a dagger in my back?Not yet.My friend, it is not easy
to forgive a foreigndevil who knows Confucius
better than they do.And grows the finest peonies in Peking!May the new tutor present himself!Your Imperial Highness, the new tutor.The Emperor is honored to
welcome his tutor.Your tutor is honored to have
been chosen, Your Majesty.One more time.Your Imperial Highness,
Mr. Reginald Fleming Johnston.How do you do, Mr. Johnston?How do you do, Your Majesty?Now we will go to school.Please begin the lesson.Your Majesty, in my
country, it would be usualto begin with some kind
of an examination.The Emperor cannot be examined.Well, that may have to change.But first, Your Majesty might
like to ask me some questions.Where are your ancestors buried?In Scotland, Your Majesty.But then, where's your skirt?In your country, men wear short skirts,
do they not?No, Your Majesty, Scotsmen do not
wear skirts. They wear kilts.Kilts.Kilts. A matter of words, perhaps,
but words are important.Why are words important?If you cannot say what you mean, Your
Majesty, you will never mean what you say.And a gentleman should always
mean what he says.Ah, yes! A gentleman.
Are you a gentleman?I would like to be a gentleman,
Your Majesty. I try to be.I'm not a gentleman. I'm not
allowed to say what I mean.They are always telling me
what to say.Your Majesty is still very young.I thought he might like to see some
English and American magazines.I have just received them.I know that you know that I
know that you know that,that is a dialog between
Confucius and Chuang Tzu.Concerning respect, Your Majesty.Who is this ""George Washington""?A famous American, Your Majesty.A revolutionary General,
the first American President.Ah! Like Mr. Lenin in Russia?Not quite.Does he have a car?He lived a long time ago, Your Majesty.I want a car.I think your mouse is trying to
escape, Your Majesty.Please do not tell anyone about
my mouse.The lesson is finished.Our official taster's a brave man.Many of my ancestors
have been poisoned, you know.Does Your Majesty have lunch
like this every day?Oh, yes! Every day!
Like theater!I do not know why.
It has always been like that.This is my royal food.Your Majesty!
One hundred year eggs.Snake bow.Angel's hair.Garlic sprout, steamed turtle,
goat nipples...There's a danger of poisoning pots.My food comes directly
from the high consorts.Their tasters had already tried them.It always arrives a bit cold.How do they kill Emperors in
the West?The Austrian Emperor was shot, was he not?No, but his nephew was assassinated
before the Great War.But the Russian Emperor had
been shot. He was called the Tsar.- Yes.
- He took lots of our land in Manchuria.I'm a Manchurian. Even after the republic,
it's still my country.The-uh... secret, Your Majesty,
is emerging again.Is something the matter, Your Majesty?Something is happening.Silence. Tell them to be quiet.Silence.Silence.What is happening,
Mr. Johnston?- Uh, nothing is happening.
- Quiet!On my way here, Your Majesty, we were
held up by students from the university.They were protesting against the
republican government,because it has agreed to give
away Chinese territory to Japan.Is it true, Mr. Johnston, that many people
out there have had their heads chopped off?It is true, Your Majesty.
Many heads have been chopped off.It does stop them thinking.It is time for the Emperor's rest.The students are right to be angry.I'm angry!But I'm not allowed
to leave the Forbidden City.I want to go out,
Mr. Johnston!My lord!I want to see the city of sounds!The Emperor awards you with
the order of the Ruby Hat Button,and with the right to be carried in your
own chair, with four bearers.The last Emperor died
on the same nightas the Empress Guwalgiya, the night
I was brought to the Forbidden City,when I was three.The eunuchs think he was murdered,
but who killed him.And why?
And who will kill me?The chair, your excellency.The traditional gift to eunuchs.Many thanks. Be grateful.- If it is official practice,
- Always, sir, always, sir.In which case, I would like an
official receipt.Stop!One, two,Three, four, five...Emperor extends his apologies.Please tell the Emperor
that there is no offense.Emperor who has been offended.Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen...Even the bicycle was viewed with
suspicion in the Forbidden City.My present to the Emperor
lead to a lot of trouble.Change about!I hope the Emperor has not forgotten
that this is the day for his math class.For Your Majesty!My doctor says,
""Bicycles are bad for you.""Bad for you, nonsense!How does it work?Oh, it's simple.Head up and eyes forward!
As in math!My mother is dead, is she not?Yes, Your Majesty.I'm profoundly sorry!I'm not.She killed herself.She swallowed the ball of opium.I'm going to see her, and my brother.Open the door. Open the door.Open the door.Fallen devil and fallen machine.
Trouble! Nothing but trouble!- Look where you lead him!
- And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man.The boy's mother is dead,
and he's not even allowed to see her!I want to go home!I want to go home!Stop it, stop it, stay where you are!I want to go home!Stop it, stay where you are!You fool! Stay there!Chang!Hunchback, Big Foot!Sir? Give me your hand, sir.
Give me your hand, sir!Can you not see?Look at my left ear, please, sir.Thank you, and my right.
Thank you.Would you follow my finger, please, sir.Just the eyes, Your Majesty, not the head.Well, it's perfectly simple, Johnston.
The Emperor needs spectacles.Like Harold Lloyd!Impossible! An Emperor does
not wear spectacles!That cannot be allowed!Times have changed,
Your Highnesses!If His Majesty doesn't get spectacles,
Johnston, he could lose his sight.Now, please, could you show me
the way out of here?Your Majesty.If the Emperor does not get
spectacles, I will resign.Unfortunately,
our decision is final.And, unfortunately, what I have to say will
be published in every newspaper in China.What do you have to say,
Mr. Johnston?The Emperor has been a prisoner
in his own palace since the daythat he was crowned and has remained
a prisoner since he abdicated.But now that he's growing up, he may
wonder why he is the only person in Chinawho may not walk out of
his own front door.I think the Emperor is the
loneliest boy on earth.It would be conveniently sad
if he becomes blind.Blind, Mr. Johnston?To the expense, Your Excellency.
To the cost ofmaintaining one thousand
two hundred eunuchs,three hundred and fifty
ladies-in-waitingand one hundred and eighty-five
cooks to buying a hundredand twenty sable furs a month and
three thousand chickens a week.To the fact that eight
hundred and forty guardsand employees of the
household department,plus one Lord Chamberlain,
care only about one thing!Filling their own rice bowls!You are very good at accounts,
Mr. Johnston!The Emperor may have abdicated,but he's still a symbol
of great importance to many people.If I did not agree with that,
I would not be here.And some of us believe that one day soon,
he may be more than a symbol.The spectacles are a detail.What do you really want,
Mr. Johnston?Just the spectacles.The Princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty.
Seventeen years old.Princess Wu Chang,
fifteen years old.The princess De Li, Your Majesty,
and the Princess Fung Ying.The Princess Wang Ching.The Princess Shilean,
sixteen years old.Who is this?Princess Wen Hsiu,
twelve years old.She has got a funny face.Not just one wife. One empress
and one secondary consort.- Two wives?   - But who did you
choose to be the Empress?They chose her! She's very old,
Johnston! She's seventeen!That's not so old, Your Majesty.
What does she look like?Old fashioned! I want a modern wife,
Johnston, who speaks English and French!And who can dance the quickstep!Johnston!Sir!I'm going to escape, Johnston.I've got a suitcase,
and a ticket to England.I'm going to Oxford University.Your Majesty, if you get married, you will
become the master of your own house.A wedding might be a more
practical way to escape.I suppose she's on her way by now.It will be all right.
They do everything for you.Why did you never get married,
Johnston?Your Mongolian cousin
Prince Demchukedamgruvhas sent you twelve
racing camels.Plus this.On behalf of Manchuria.A lump of coal.Manchuria...The secondary consort
welcomes the Empress.The Empress greets
the secondary consort.You are doing everything very well.Thank you.
I rehearsed many times.What is His Majesty thinking?I was thinking, if I was the real Emperor,
I would become the ruler of China now.And what would the Emperor do,
if he could really rule?I would change everything,
even the way we get married.Is the Emperor against arranged
marriages?It is humiliating not to choose
whom you marry!Even I was not allowed
to choose.And yet westerners might be amazedhow much happiness can come from
arranged marriages.That is what old-fashioned women say,
like the high consorts.In another year or two, His Majesty
will be taller than me.Is it true the Emperor has a suitcase
under his bed and is going to Oxford?Will the Emperor take
Wan Jung with him?Perhaps he would like to
see my face before he decides.Yes, the Emperor would like to
see the face of the Empress.It is the Emperor who must
remove the kait'ou.I also had a tutor like Mr. Johnston.Miss Windsor. She's American.Miss Windsor taught me how to
do the dance of the quickstep.Does the Emperor know how to
do the quickstep?Will you teach me?Leave us! Leave us!If Your Majesty thinks
it is old-fashioned tomake the rain and the
wind with a stranger,we can be like a modern couple,
to begin with.A modern couple?Good night.Good night.You must come to Oxford with me.I like him! I am sure
I am going to like him!And he will grow up!Eyes down!Report your arrival!Prisoner 981 reporting.- Louder!
- Prisoner 981 reporting.Open the door!Close the door!Sit down!Name?Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.Write it!Now read that aloud!Leniency to those who confess,
severity to those who resist,Redemption to those who gain merits.Now than, there are two types
of confession.We call them
toothpaste and water tap.The toothpaste prisoner
needs to be squeezed everynow and then or else he
forgets to keep confessing.The water tap man needs one good
hard twist before he starts.But then everything comes out.Now, you're an intelligent person.
I'm sure you understand me.Good.
Then we will begin.Why do you think you are
in here, 981?I'm accused of being a traitor, a
collaborator, and a counter-revolutionary.It is not an accusation!You are a traitor, you are a collaborator,
and you are a counter-revolutionary!!Did you write this?
And you call it a confession?This is nothing but a list of dates!
A child's fairy tale!What do you want me to confess?You know what you did and
what others did.So why don't you
volunteer the information?I do not understand.We don't tell people what to confess.
We already know everything about you.I...Go on.I wanted reforms.What did you want to reform?Everything.Chang, you have a house outside
the Forbidden City. Do you not?- Yes, Your Majesty.
- It has 20 rooms, I understand.And you also have houses.Oh, we all do, Your Majesty.I recently learned that many pieces from
the Imperial collections are on salein antique shops in Peking.
Is that true, Cheng?- Would you do me a favor, Wen Hsiu?
- Of course.Stop growing.The Forbidden City is a theater
without an audience.The audience left long ago
when China became a republic.- Cut off my queue.
- Your Majesty! Please!It is heavy!The Emperor before me was murdered
because he wanted to reform the empire.Is that not so, Mr. Johnston?Yes, Your Majesty, probably.Well, let us see if they will kill me for
reforming the Forbidden City.Lord Chamberlain! I'm appointing
Mr. Johnston's friend,the poet and scholar, Chin Hsiao Hsiu,
to be the new Lord Chamberlain.I want him to supervise a detailed
inventory of the Imperial storerooms!So that we can learn exactly
how much has been stolen!Can I sleep here?
I am frightened.You're brave.
Are you not frightened?I am excited.
I do not want to escape anymore.I want to rule.Kiss me.Can I stay with you as well?Get in. Get in.I used to play a game with the eunuchs.Trying to guess who is who.Now I cannot see you!Wan Jung? Wen Hsiu?Come underneath the sheet with us.Your Majesty! The storeroom's
on fire, Your Majesty!Chang Chinghui, did you
not write a poem abouta spider who gets
caught in his own web?I did not know Your Majesty had read
my poetry. I'm very honored.I'm the spider.The eunuchs set fire to this place to
stop me knowing what they have stolen.I'm going to expel them
from the Forbidden City.There are twelve hundred eunuchs,
Your Majesty.They have been here for
eight hundred years.It will be dangerous.Do you think the republican government
would help me?The republicans will do almost anything
if you know who to speak to.It must happen quickly.Before they burn the whole
place with us inside.I lived with them all my life, Johnston.
They're my family.Your Majesty, there is no alternative.- What is happening?
- I don't know.What are they carrying?Their organs.Whatever their crimes,
they cannot be deprivedof the right to be
buried as whole men.Well?I have forgot what
I was saying.You're wasting our time!We want to know about the Japanese.How did your friendship
with the Japanese begin?Who introduced you?
When?It was... I think it was the new Lord
Chamberlain, Chin Hsiao Hsiu. It was 1924.Parliament had been dissolved again.
The president had fled.At first, I thought it was just another a
coup d'etat by just another warlord.Only this time it was different.
This time it was my turn.Fifteen, love.Play.Your Highness, how shocking.Thirty love.Ready?Thirty, fifteen.The rotten government of
the republic is in flight!Now we shall remove the
foreign stench of theManchurian rats who still
hide in the Forbidden City.Mr. Pu Yi and his family have been given
one hour to leave the Forbidden City.They will be escorted
to the home of his fatherand remain there under guard as state
prisoners until further notice.What are you all looking at?
What are you standing there for?You always wanted to leave
the Forbidden City.Now you're got an hour to pack.
So, go! Go!I always thought I hated it here.
Now, I'm afraid to leave.Do you think they will kill me?You must do as they say, Your Majesty,
while I try to reach the British Embassy.They will give you asylum there.
I'm sure they will.Chang, take my car to the South gate!
I want you to drive His Majesty.Your Majesty!Please, Your Majesty!What?But you didn't go to
the British Embassy, did you?You ended up at the Japanese Embassy.The Japanese were the only people
prepared to help me.Help you for nothing?Japan has an Emperor.
We're almost the same age.I thought it was kindness.At the same time, I realized that,
for many Chinese, I was an alien.Simply because I am Manchurian.There was even an anti-Manchurian
league who wanted to assassinate me!So, I went to live in Tientsin.There was a nice provincial town
with a big port.In those days, we had a large,
international settlement.The Japanese thought it would
be safer for me there.If you had read the books we
gave you more carefully,you might have learned
that the anti-Manchurianleague was largely
financed by the Japanese.It was designed to frighten you.I did not know that at the time.- Cigarette?
- I do not smoke.Were the Japanese paying
for you in Tientsin?Oh, no.I had to rent a villa,
the Villa Chan, and it was very expensive.So were the bodyguards.I spent a lot of money in Tientsin.Did you still believe in a restoration
of the Imperial system?Others did.
They were later caught and exiled.I cannot remember how much jade
and jewelry they made mespend to buy the friendship of some warlord
or some white Russian general.I even financed an English
speaking newspaper.They closed after three days.
It was unreadable.And what else did you spend
your money on?Oh, I was never tired of buying pianos,
watches, radios...As long as they were foreign!Of course.
Anything Western was good.Especially Wrigley's chewing gum,
Bayer aspirin, and cars.While you were in Tientsin,
most of China cameunder the control of
General Chiang Kai Shek,the so-called Nationalists,
the Kuomintang.What were your relations with them?None.I felt useless in Tientsin.
I was twenty-one.I dreamt of going to the West.I became a playboy.Am I blue. Am I blue.Ain't these tears in my eyes
telling you. Am I blue?You'd be, too. If each plan with
your girl done fell through.Was a time, I was her only one.But now I'm the sad and lonely one.
Boo-Boo-Boo, Boo-Boo-Boo.Now she's gone and we're
through. Lord, I'm blue.- Very good.
- Well done.That's a great ship,
if you're going first-class.I'm not going anywhere.Would you like to dance?You're a brave man. Nobody here
would have danced with me.Why is that?- Because I'm Chinese.
- Well, I'm American.You say California.
I say French Riviera.San Francisco!Monte Carlo! Are we really going this time?- Who's that couple?
- Oh, Henry and Elizabeth.- The Emperor of China?
- The ex-Emperor and his wife.- She's beautiful.
- Yes, very.And who are you?I'm His Highness's other wife.- His other wife?
- Number two wife.Well, some people have the luck.Ladies and gentlemen!General Chiang Kai Shek
has taken Shanghai!The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds
and have knocked them for six!The Reds are finished!Sorry about the reception, everyone!It would be wiser to return to the Japanese
delegation now, Your Majesty.- Your car is waiting.
- Thank you, Mr. Amakasu.The general strike in Shanghai
has collapsed.The international settlement is safe.Troops of the Kuomintang
are now in full control of the city.And firm steps are being taken to
restore order in the native areas.What do you think of General
Chiang Kai Shek?What should I think of him?
He's just another warlord.Well, he has mashed
the Communists.That's good. Except the Communists were
his sworn allies until a few days ago.I expect he betrayed them
for money.- You want some gum, Elizabeth?
- Uh-huh.Wen Hsiu, you want some gum?I want a divorce.I do not want to be your
mistress any longer.I thought you were my
secondary consort.In the Forbidden City, you were the
Emperor and I was a secondary consort.But now you are Henry Pu Yi.Wan Jung is your wife, Elizabeth.And who am I? I'm nobody.I did not know you were so unhappy.You can only have one wife
in the West.I want a divorce.No one can divorce me!I want a divorce!Come inside with me?Leave me alone.Your Ladyship!Thank you.I do not need it!I do not need it!Wen Hsiu?Elizabeth! Can I come in?Don't you remember me? I'm dressed like
a pilot, but I still can't fly! Not yet.Eastern Jewel!
We had dancing classes together!Yes, just before your marriage.Silly girl!
Why do people want to get married?Wen Hsiu has gone.
She will never come back.Is it so bad?She was my only friend.Well, at least now you've got
your husband all to yourself!And you've got me!I'll be your friend.- You smoke opium?
- Be wicked.It's the best in Shanghai!
Why are you going to Europe?The place to go is Japan!
It's more fun than anywhere!It's modern.How do you know we're going
to Europe? It is a secret.Oh, I know everything!I know Chiang Kai Shek has got false teeth.I even know his nickname,
""cash my check!""I'm a spy. And I don't
care who knows it.A spy?I work for the Japanese
Special Service Bureau,and I've come to protect you.The Japanese. They are getting
closer to him every day.He is sending his brother to the
military academy in Tokyo.They talk to him about
Manchuria all the time.And Mr. Amakasu
never says hello to me.I do not trust the Japanese.Of course, I'd love to be the
Emperor's new secondary consort!Eastern Jewel.If the post is available.The post is vacant,
my dear cousin.But you do not fit the part!Wen Hsiu left the dog behind.
Do you want it?It is my fault.
It is all my fault.I came to see you, Your Majesty,
to give you bad news.Something terrible has happened.The Imperial tombs of our Manchurian
ancestors have been attacked and robbedby troops of the Kuomintang.
Chinese soldiers.A warlord working for
Chiang Kai Shek.The body of the Empress Dowager
was hacked to pieces.Her pearl necklace
has become a weddingpresent from Chiang Kai
Shek to his new wife.Prisoner 981 reporting.Open the door!Close the door!Tell me, 981. Do you consider
yourself to be Chinese?- Of course.
- What is this?Japan.And what do you call this part
of China?- The Northeast.   - And what did
you call it as a child?Manchuria.Japan invaded Manchuria on
September eighteenth, 1931and began to set up a puppet
state called Manchukuo.Shortly afterwards, a Japanese delegation
paid you a secret visit in Tientsinto request your collaboration,
which you say you refused.Speak up!I've already told you.
I have told you a hundred times.Tell us again! Tell us
two hundred times!I refused to collaborate.You say you refused, but a month
later, on November tenth, 1931,there you are arriving in Manchuria,
or should I call it Manchukuo?Now, according to this
so-called confession ofyours, you didn't go
of your own free will!You insist that you were
kidnapped by the Japanese!- Yes.
- And taken to Manchuria by force!- Yes!
- Sit down!Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?He was your tutor.Yes.And a good friend, I believe.After twenty-eight years in China,
Mr. Johnston returned to England.He became a professor of Oriental
studies at London University,and he wrote a book. It is called
Twilight in the Forbidden City,and it is dedicated to you.I am going to miss you,
Johnston.I shall miss you, Your Majesty.Do you think a man can
become Emperor again?Yes.Thank you, Your Majesty.How can we say ""Good-bye""?As we said, ""Hello.""Farewell, Mr. Johnston.Farewell, Your Majesty.All aboard! All aboard!Thank you, sir.Good-bye, Mr. Johnston!
We'll never forget you, Mr. Johnston.Good-bye! Mr. Johnston!
Good-bye! Good-bye!All aboard!On page four-hundred
and forty-nine, Mr. Johnston writes,The endeavor to make out
that the Emperor hadbeen kidnapped by the
Japanese is wholly untrue.He left Tientsin and went to
Manchuria of his own free will.Johnston was a liar!What did you say?
I didn't hear you.Mr. Johnston had left before
I was taken to Manchuria.He could not have known
what happened.Sit down!Is this your confession, 895?- Yes.
- According to this account,you prepared the man's things
on the morning of November ninth!Isn't it unusual for a man who's kidnapped
to have his luggage packedby his valet the day
before he's kidnapped?This is what you've written,
isn't it?Who told you to pack this man's luggage?These two stories don't fit,
do they?It was a long time ago.
Perhaps I made a mistake.You are lying!You are both lying!Control yourself!My family was buried alive
in Manchukuo.My mother digged her own grave
because of people like them.Smash the enemies.
Smash them forever.Enough.These might help you
to remember the truth.What made you write that?It is the truth.Chen Pao Shen wishes you a safe journey.You mean he refuses to say
goodbye to me.He will see me when he comes
to my coronation.Request a truce.
In case you change your mind.I am the hereditary ruler of the
Manchurian people.There can be no Manchukuo
without me.Do you not see?
The Japanese are using you.I must try to use them.The Japanese invasion of Manchuria will be
condemned by the League of Nationsand by every civilized
country on earth!The Chinese Republic has broken every
promise it ever made to me!Chinese troops desecrated
the tombs of my ancestors!And Chinese troops did not defend
Manchuria from the Japanese!But Manchuria is still China!China has turned its back
on me.Please, do not go.Manchuria is the richest
frontier in Asia!Coal, oil, railways!Millions of Chinese immigrants
are going there every year!I'm going to build my country.Chen Pao Shen: If you go, you
betray your country.Which country?Johnston was wrong,
but he wasn't a liar.There was no kidnapping!You went to Manchuria by your own choice,
because you wanted to be Emperor again!You will rewrite your confessions
from the beginning!Guard!Take these people away!Out!To heaven.To earth.Chen Pao Shen is a fool. How could he
miss the birth of a new country?It looks like the
inauguration of a factory.To the moon.To the sun.You're an empress again.What I'm going to be is a pilot!I'm going to train at a secret base near
Yokohama to learn precision bombing.I want to bomb Shanghai.Bomb Shanghai?I hate China!I hate you.The Japanese Army High Command!Very impressive!The Japanese Army!Quickly!On behalf of the Emperor of Japan,
the commander of the Kantong Armyextends his warmest congratulations on the
occasion of His Majesty's coronation.Manchukuo will grow into a bright vision.Japan will always be on
the side of the Emperor.Uh, may I introduce you?
My wife, the Princess Hiro Saga.Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu.Honorable Chang Chinghui,
Minister of Defense.The monseigneur,
Monseigneur Colonna.The Empress and I accept with
great pleasure.Excuse me, General.Ahh! And now Mr. Amakasu.
He's the new chiefof the Manchuria
Motion Picture Studio.Why do you have to spoil this day? Why?Mr. Amakasu is the most
powerful man in Manchukuo.What are you talking about?You did not believe I could be
Emperor again, but I am.You are blind.Do you know what it means
to be an empress?You are an empress!Why do you not make love to
me anymore?Because you have become an
opium addict.Opium killed my mother.
Opium destroyed China.You can buy opium anywhere
in Manchukuo!- Shut up!
- In any shop.Shut up!Your brother is going
to have a child.We must have a child.
We must have an heir.Emperor Hirohito has officially
invited us to Japan.I'm going alone.
You are staying here.I would never go to Japan.Then go to your room!Ten thousand years to
His Majesty, the Emperor!Ten thousand years!Ten thousand years to His Majesty!To His Majesty, ten thousand years!I told you, I hate you.Only because I give you what you need.Now we're engaged.- Good morning.
- Good morning.Good morning, sir.You forgot my toothpowder.Oh... yes, sir.Move him!981!
Collect your things!I said, collect your things!Keep to the story.
That is an order.Upstairs!Stop!Your laces are undone.
Do them up!Thursday, you serve lunch.Friday, you clean the toilet.Saturday, you sweep the floor.I have never been separated
from my family.You'd better get used to it!It's not so bad.
People get used to anything.You do not remember me, do you?I was the Minister of Trade,
in Manchukuo.You were all in Manchukuo.Now I'm the cell leader.It is important to follow the rules here.No talking during study sessions!Where is your gun, Captain?
Where are their swords?Our weapons have
been removed, YourMajesty, on orders
of Colonel Yoshioka.Colonel Yoshioka?Colonel Yoshioka!What has happened here?
Why has my guard been disarmed?Yes, it is very unfortunate, Your Majesty.There have been many
changes while you were in Tokyo.Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa,the new Japanese
Ambassador to Manchukuo.Why is Prime Minister Hsiao
Hsiu not here to receive me?The Prime Minister has resigned,
Your Majesty.His son has been assassinated.- Assassinated?
- By communist bandits, Your Majesty.I must see him at once.He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty.
He has gone to a monastery, far away.Who are you?Chang Chinghui, Your Majesty,
Minister of Defense.Yes.Of course.The council meeting will
be at four o'clock,Your Majesty, before
the state dinner.The Emperor has been asked to
sign the following.After careful consideration,we have decided to nominate
the Honorable ChangChinghui as the new Prime
Minister of Manchukuo.No.Today, on our return from Japan, we wish
to speak of something more important.The future of our friendship with Japan.This is based on mutual respect,and respect means equality
and independence.When the two Emperors stood together
and saluted the two national flags,they recognized that Manchukuo
had come of age.Manchukuo is not a colony.
Manchukuo is Manchuria.The relationship between
our two countries islike the relationship
between these two Emperors.It is rooted in paternal trust,in... in the desire to preserve
our ancient traditions,and in a mutual respect for
our national identities.Already, we have welcomed the ambassadors
of El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Vatican...Soon I'm... I'm sure the other
countries will follow.Chang Chinghui was an idiot.He thought the open board were there
to decrease production.But that was just propaganda.What the Japanese really wanted
was cash, more production!Of course, they've gotten rid of him.Well, I had been in the drug business
all my life... opium, heroin.I could deal with
the green gang inShanghai, even with
Chiang Kai Shek.That is why the Japanese wanted
me to be Prime Minister.You were right.
I was blind.I'm going to have a child.
The father is Manchurian.Colonel Yoshioka, Mr. Amakasu!I did it for you!His Majesty forgot to
sign the appointment ofthe new Prime Minister,
Mr. Chang Chinghui!I did not forget.When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty, he becomes a gentleman.If he robs a lot, he becomes a knight.Do you imagine the British run
their Empire as a charity?If India has to pay for the cost of its own
occupation, so must Manchukuo.We hope Manchukuo will have an heir.
The Empress is expecting a child.Yes, Your Majesty,
we are aware of the situation.This is the name of the father.His name is Chang!
He is your driver!All the necessary facts have been recorded.
The man will be punished.The Emperor cannot allow
his honor to be stained.The Japanese are the only
divine race on earth.We will take China,
Hong Kong, Indochina,Siam, Malaya,
Singapore, and India!Asia belongs to us!How long have you been here?Three years.You were issued with the same
clothes as everyone else.Why can't you learn to look
after yourself?There have been complaints
from your cellmates.You must learn how to urinate
at night without waking them all up!The way to do it is to
urinate against theside of the bucket,
not into the middle!Yes, comrade.You still think I'm your
servant, don't you?This is the last time, the last time.This is the last time.Why do you think Big Li has been
in prison all this time?Or haven't you thought about it?Because he was my servant.Yes.Loyalty is a great quality, isn't it?So do you think it is unjust that your
loyal servant is punished for serving you?I think it is not a question of justice.It is a question of justice!Even the servant has a choice.Maybe he had nothing to do with
the political decisions of Manchukuoor the crimes that happened
around me.He was the only innocent person there.Sit down.Carmen Li is now a free citizen
of the People's Republic of China.He is being released today.You have a train to catch.This is my wife.
We had three children.You know nothing about me.Thank you.For a long time, I thought you kept
him in prison,because you wanted
someone to look after me.If you went out on the streets of China
today, and people knew who you were,somebody would probably try
to kill you!You talk of your past as if you were
the only one who suffered.Stop hiding behind
your private story.Write it again! All of it.We are all pretending. You are
just pretending you have changed.You cannot speak like that in here.That is counter-revolutionary talk.I know who you all are.You were a captain of
the Imperial Guard,and you become a spy
in the palace.You, the Minister of Trade,were responsible for the starvation
in Manchukuo.He...
Prime Minister of Narcotics.Shut up! The party teaches
us to be new men!We're working for a new China!You worked in Amakasu's private office.You are still the same people!
People do not change.Guard! Guard!Guard!I let it happen.Guard! Guard!I let it happen.The second edict, Your Majesty.
Japanese willbe the official language
in Manchukuo schools.Your Majesty!The baby was born dead, Your Majesty.How is the Empress?It would be better if she goes
to a clinic, somewhere warm.She's already left,
Your Majesty.Open the door.With Manchukuo now firmly
in their grasp, theJapanese soon controlled
most of North China.By 1937, they were ready to strike South,
at the heart of the country.The attack on Shanghai was one of the
first civilian bombing raids in history.It left thousands homeless,
thousands dead.Three months later,
Japanese armies werebesieging the provisional
capital at Nanking.And when the city fell,
the atrocities began.Trying to terrorize
the rest of China into surrender,the Japanese High Command
ordered a massacre.More than two hundred thousand
civilians were systematically executed.The world watched in horror,
but no help was given.On December the
seventh, 1941, Japanattacked the American
fleet at Pearl Harbor.There was no warning.Manchukuo, the Japanese
bastion in North China,was still ruled by the
puppet Emperor, Pu Yi.But behind the facade of triumph
was a country enslaved.A country where Japanese
experimenting biologicalwarfare were carried out
on live human beings.A country where opium production became
the easiest way to finance the war.Millions of people were deliberately
turned into drug addicts.Nine days after the bomb at Hiroshima,
on August the fifteenth, 1945,Emperor Hirohito announced
the surrender of Japan.It was the first time his voice
had ever been heard on radio.You must get to Tokyo, Your Majesty.You must surrender to
the Americans, not the Russians.The communists will kill everyone!Your excellence have reached Habi.We must leave at once.There is no room in the plane.No trucks!The Empress has returned.Your Majesty, please.The Empress must not know you
have seen her like that.Your Majesty!Hurry! There is no room on the plane,
Your Majesty!The women are looking beat.
We must hurry!Your Majesty!
Your Majesty is leaving now!Now!The Russians!Perhaps you think we are here
to teach men to lie in a new way.Why did you sign every
accusation made against you?I didn't stop you from killing
yourself to see you like this.Someone who signs anything to please
his enemies, to please me!You knew about a lot of things in
Manchukuo, even the secret agreements.But you couldn't possibly
have known about theJapanese biological warfare
experiments in Harbin!Could you? So why
did you sign these papers?I was responsible for everything.You are responsible for what you do!All your life you thought you were
better than everyone else.Now you think you're the worst of all!Why can you not leave me
alone?You saved my life to make me
a puppet in your own play.You saved me because I am useful to you.Is that so terrible, to be useful?Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi!By order of the Supreme
People's Court,the war criminal, Aisin-Gioro
Pu Yi, male, fifty-three years old,of the Manchu nationality, and from Peking,has now served
ten years detention!As a result of remolding through labor and
ideological education during his captivity,he has shown that he has
genuinely reformed!In accordance with clause
one of the SpecialPardon Order, he is
therefore to be released!You see, I will end up living in
prison longer than you.The Red Guards!They are so young.It is dangerous.Look, over there, Pu Chieh, look!It is the governor of our prison!- It cannot be!
- It is! I'm sure it is!Be careful! Come back!Comrade, this must be a mistake!
I know this man! He is a good man.- Who are you?
- I am a gardener.Join us, comrade, or buzz off!- But what has he done?
- He has been accused.- Accused of what?   - Imperialismania!
Reactionary elements! Traitor to country!- Confess your crimes!
- I have nothing to confess.Kowtow to Chairman Mao!- Confess your crimes!
- I have nothing to confess.Kowtow!- Confess your crimes!
- Wait!He's a teacher!
He is a good teacher!- You! Get out of here!
- You can't do this to him!Move!
You want to be him?You are wrong!
He is a good teacher!Decision of reactionary element!
Decision of reactionary element!Stop!
You are not allowed in there!- Who are you?   - I live here!
I'm the son of the guardian!Ah, well, I used to live here, too.That is where I sat.Who are you?I was the Emperor of China.Prove it!This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony where
the Emperors were crowned.The last Emperor to be crowned
here was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.He was three years old.
He died in 1967."

the best cut man in the business.Can you stop it?Started training and managing in the '60s,
but he never lost his gift.No.Let me have a look at him.He's fine. He's fine.Well, he ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.I'll give you one more round.Seconds out. Let's go.What do we do? Tell me what to do.You let him hit you.Sometimes there's just nothing you can do.Cut's too wide too close to the bone.Maybe you got a severed vein,or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.There are all kinds
of combinations you come up againstdown in the different layers of meat,and Frankie knew how to work every one.People love violence.They slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.Same people claim to love boxing.They got no idea what it is.Boxing is about respect -getting it for yourself,and taking it away from the other guy.I'll warm up the car.Mr. Dunn?Hmm. I owe you money?No, sir.I know your mama?Don't rightly know, sir.Then what is it you want?I was on the undercard. I won my fight, too.Maggie Fitzgerald.Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?Did you happen to see it?- Nope.
- I did pretty good.Thought you might
be interested in training me.I don't train girls.Maybe you should.
People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.Girlie, tough ain't enough.It's a mistake.Car should be able to back up, Frankie.Just push, will you?What did Hogan want?Offered us a title shot.- 'Bout time.
- I turned him down flat.Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.You lose it, it may not come around again.Now, two or three more fights,
and we'll be ready.Whatever you say, Frankie.Frankie liked to say
that boxing is an unnatural act,that everything in boxing is backwards.Sometimes,best way to deliver a punch is step back.Well, do your best, Lord, to... protect Katy.Annie, too.Other than that... you know what I want.There's no use me repeating myself.But step back too far you ain't fightin' at all.Thank you for your prayers.- Bye.
- Goodbye.Hey, Father, that was a great sermon.Made me weep.What's confusing you this week?Oh, it's the same old one God, three God thing.Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?You only come to Mass every day to wind me
up. It's not going to happen this morning.Well, I'm confused.- No, you aren't.
- Yes, I am.Then here's your answer: There's one God.Anything else? Cos I'm busy.- What about the Holy Ghost?
- An expression of God's love.- And Jesus?
- Son of God. Don't play stupid.Well, what is he, then?
Does that make him a demigod?There are no demigods, you fuckin' pagan!Did you write to your daughter?Absolutely.Now you're lying to a priest.
You know what? Take a day off.Don't come to Mass tomorrow.Some people'd say the most
important thing a fighter can have is heart.Frankie'd say,
""Show me a fighter with nothing but a heart,and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating. ""Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.My name's Dangerous DillardFightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch
out of Broward County, Texas!Danger showed up a couple of years back.He'd come visiting LA with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.Danger looked for him for about a week
'fore he introduced himself.Hey. You know, I gots nothin' against niggers...Well, that's nice to hear.Yeah. Yeah.Lots of people where I comes from does,but my mama taught me not to cause hurt
to no man, niggers or not.You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?Just one of those questions,
but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the Welterweight Champion of the world.And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas ""Hit Man"" Hearns,to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.You got to have at least one fight to be ranked.Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!Hey you a bad man huh?Hey, come on, get in the ring.
Go a round with me.Shawrelle...I will.Leave him alone.Danger, you go on back to training.Will do, Mr. Scrap.Ow!Them some nice tights, Danger.I'll give you that ass-whoopin' later, Olive Oyl.Those pants look real pretty on you bro.Give his mama back her tights.Shawrelle Berry
had a left hook that would move a tank,but he had a heart the size of a split pea.Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.Bobby wanted to move to Florida
and Frankie wanted some security.Bobby died while he was packing.Frankie found out most gyms lose money.I thought I told you I didn't want Danger
working out here anymore.Oh, he ain't hurtin' nothin', Frankie.Well, he's hurtin' me.Breakin' my heart watchin' him
punch the air like it's going to punch back.And how many times have I got to
tell you that bleach is bleach?Why can't you just buy the cheap stuff?You don't always have to buy expensive stuff.It smells better, Frankie.Bleach smells like bleach.Hey, Scrap.Hey, Mr. Willie.Hey, nice fight last night.Big Willie.Hey, Sally.- Nice fight.
- thanks, man.People are talkin'.""Ta cul fionn is dha shuil ghlasa agat. ""What the hell kind of language is that?What do you want?I just thought you might like to knowyou got a fighter out there
not talking to another manager.Not talking to another manager?Not just any manager.Mickey Mack.You came in here to tell me
that Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.Not a word. Neither one of 'em.I'm trying to read here.Well, if you think that's more important...Who's your new girl?What?Jesus Christ.Better hurry up.If she keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.youre wasting your time.- I told you I don't train girls.
- Thought you might change your mind.There's dozens of trainers who train girls.You won't have any trouble finding one.Don't hardly need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.- Willie, you ready to work?
- Anytime.If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?No.I might as well just keep calling you it.She came from
southwestern Missouri,the hills outside
the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia,set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere
between nowhere and good-bye.She grew up knowing one thing,she was trash.It's for my dog.She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.Workin' the bag, boss.Not your boss... and that bag's working you.Give her her money back.You sure?How much did she pay?Six months.Oh, Jesus Christ.No I'll just give it back.No. Don't be a smart-ass now, will you?Woman thinks I'd throw away six months' dues
just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.- But just don't encourage her, understand?
- OK.And... And what's Danger doing out there?What's he lookin' at?Looks like a bottle of water.He paid his dues?Dues?Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?Get out of my office.Fuck me.Can't think of it as a bag.I'm not a trainer,but I can show you this, if you'd like.Appreciate any help I can get.OK. Let's see.What you want to do is
you want to think of it as a man, see?And he's constantly moving.He's moving towards you. He's moving around
you. He's moving away from you, all right?You don't want to hit him
when he's coming towards youcos what he's going to do is push you back.He's going to smother your punches,
take your balance, right?So watch him carefully.
Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving,and keep one shoulder back
so you're always ready to fire a power shot.Right? Go ahead, now.Good, good. Keep rotating.Keep moving. That's it.Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.Come on around.Keep moving, keep moving.Good, good, good, good.- Like that?
- Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots.Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.That's good. That's good.Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.You do have a speed bag?I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.All right, you go on home now.I'll walk out with you?No, I am home. Want to see?Yeah.It's nice.Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?No, just...pull the door closed when you leave.Thank you.If there's magic in boxing,it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance,beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.OK, come on. Watch the footwork.Hey, Flip.Hey, Flippy, come here, man.I think I found somebody you can beat.I don't fights women.Why not, bro?
It's perfect, bro, cos you know why?Cos she - nah, you- you could fight to himand then you could kiss to him, and then
you could fight to him one more time.That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.- It's like poetry.
- You been reading and shit.thanks, bro. That's a girl, man?I'll be damn, Flip. I think you right.Look at her little bitty titties.
They're like mosquito bites.Geez, man, there's barely even a mouthful.Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.Oh! Oh!Canvas has titties.Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.Come on, bro, the floor is having titties?
That's funny, bro.Shut up, man.What you laughing at?Man, hold the bag, stupid.Yo, when they start making those tights for men,
Flippy?Punk.All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.- I'll give you a rubdown.
- Oh, I can't, Frankie.My middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Gracie I'd drive her.Oh. Something wrong with Gracie's car?She hates that car. Wants the old one back,
but the dealer won't do it.- Said he's already got a buyer.
- Maybe I should talk to the dealer.I'd appreciate that.OK.Thanks.See you later.The man's a rubdown whore.Today he doesn't want one?You ever do any work around here?Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.Little girl seems to be coming along.Yeah.It's almost like someone's been helping her.She might just be a natural.Looks like she's got something.She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.I wonder how the hell she got that.I wonder.I'm going to need that speed bag back.- This bag?
- Yes, that bag.That's my bag, and if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.Is that such a bad thing, boss?Yes, yes, it is.Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.Yeah. Well,
I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.I understand.Yeah.Look, you seem like a nice girl.- Can I give you some advice?
- I'd appreciate that.You're going to find a trainer,
either here or somewhere else,that's going to want to train a girl.It's the latest freak show out there.But the trouble is, they're going to be wasting
your time because you're too old.I don't feel that old.Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?Takes about four years to train a fighter.How old are you?- 31... until my next birthday.
- Oh well, there you go.31.You wouldn't start training
to be a ballerina at 31, now, would you?Already been working it for three years.And you can't hit a speed bag?What kind of training is that?I've never had any, boss.Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.Somebody's gotta be honest with you.I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.Yeah.Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.You're not going to cry now, are you?No, sir.Yeah.Here.Keep the goddamn thing.- No, you need it.
- No, take the bag.I haven't seen it in 20 years, anyway.I've had three since then.Just uh... just enjoy it, will you?I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.Yeah.Just don't lose it.Yeah, I know, Hogan.Your guy's the champ, so we don't split fifties.But if I don't see 40%...Look, you call me back when it's 60-40,
or don't call me back at all.Hey, Willie.- Hey, Frankie.
- Is something wrong?I'm sorry to come by your house like this.I- I know you don't like people dropping in.Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.I want to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.Gracie broke out and cried
when she saw it.Really?I also needed to talk with you about business.Oh, well, I just got off the phone with Hogan.
We're all set for September.Everything but the split.I gotta leave you, Frankie.What?Willie, the... the title is just two fights away.It ain't that. It's...It's like you said, I got one shot.If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.I need somebody in the action,
who can make things happen.And I gotta make the change before the fight.Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.So, I get you to the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?Only way he'd do it.I'm sorry, Frankie.I know how long
you've been waiting on a title.I wish it could've been with me.Mickey Mack's a businessman.He can't teach you nothing.You already taught me
everything I need to know.There's some things
people just don't want to hear.And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas ""Hit Man"" Hearns,to fight me for the
Welterweight Championship of the whole world.Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.Danger, while you thinking about that punch,
I'll be right back.I'm... I'm thinking how
I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr. Scrap.No one had the heart
to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.I heard about Willie.That's cold. That's dead cold.Course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.Yeah. At least I can see through both eyes.Yeah, mm-hm. Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?Well, I've got the gym.Don't need to be training fighters at my age.Willie tell you why?It was Mickey.Mickey's got the connections.It ain't about connections, Frank.
It's about you not believing in him.Well, I found him.
I stuck with him for eight years.How's that for not believing in him?You could've got him a title fight two years ago.
Hell, he knew that.I'm amazed he stayed this long.Yeah, well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head, not protect him?Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship?Yeah.Oh, well, now it makes sense.Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?You were a hell of a fighter,
a lot better than Willie.He get you a title fight
or did he just bust you out,banging your head against other people's fists
until you lost your eye?I had my shot.I went out swinging and no man can say I didn't.Yeah, well, I remember.
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighterspending the second half of his life
cleaning up other people's spit.Yeah right.Right. You're the smart one.You're the one learning Greek.It's Gaelic.Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.How do you say that in Gaelic?Sorry.Thanks.Boxing is an unnatural act,cos everything in it is backwards.You want to move to the left,you don't step left you push on the right toe.To move right you use your left toe.Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do,you step into it.Oh my God! He hits the
champ with a right hand and the champ's down!Ladies and gentlemen,
the ref has ended the count.And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world!It's unbelievable how this
has taken place tonight.But there you have it folks, a new champion.Everything in boxing is backwards.Want a cheeseburger?- You bought me a cheeseburger?
- Yeah.I never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.You watch the fight?Yeah, I watched it.Willie did good.That's what you've got to say?Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up.That's good work.You watch it?Yeah, I got HBO.How can you afford HBO?How long have I been telling you
to save your money?Ever since I fought
Louis ""Typhoon"" Johnsonat the Stadium Club in Tupelo Mississippi.That true?Yeah. Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.Don't you remember nothing?Well, I remember walking halfway,and thinking I was going to be lynched.I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.Yeah, well, I got a ride.The guy took off before I hardly closed the door.
I had to walk back two miles.Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.Hmm.What the hell's that?It's her birthday.You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.So, it's your birthday, huh?How old does that make you?I'm 32, Mr. Dunn...
and I'm here celebrating the factthat I spent another year scraping dishes
and waitressing, what I've been doing since 13.And according to you, I'll be 37
'fore I can even throw a decent punch...which after working this speed bag for a month
and getting nowhere,I now realize may be God's simple truth.Other truth is, my brother's in prison,my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her babies is still alive,my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home,find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.That enough truth to suit you?This your speed bag?Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.OK.Just hold it, hold it.I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.No. Sorry.- You're in a position to negotiate?
- Yes, sir,because I know if you train me right,
I'm going to be a champ.I seen you looking at me.Yeah, out of pity.Don't you say that!Don't you say that if it ain't true!I want a trainer.I don't want charityand I don't want favors.If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.Stop, stop, stop.Goddamn it, stop.What the hell are you doing?OK.If I'm going to take you on...You won't never regret it.Look, just listen to me.- If I take you on...
- I promise I'll work so hard.God, this is a mistake already.Mm-mm. I'm listening, boss.If I take you on, you don't say anything.You don't question me.You don't ask why, you don't say anything
except maybe, ""Yes, Frankie. ""And I'm going to try to forget
the fact that you're a girl.It's all I ask.And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.- All righty.
- We got a deal.No, not quite.I'm going to teach you how to fight.Then, we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.I hate to argue with you, but...Don't argue, it's the only way we're doing it.I teach you all you need to know, and then
you go off and make a million dollars.I don't care you get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.I don't want to hear about it either way,
that's how it is. It's the only way I'll do it.All right.Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is, you never move your feet.You stand there just flatfooted.
You've got to move your feet.That's one of the best things
I'm going to be able to teach you.So, here's what you do. You get yourself...Bend your knees a little bit.Get in an athletic position.Look like you're going to hit something.- Move 'em how boss?
- Uh, just, you go hit the bag.- Stop.
- What'd I do wrong?OK, you did two things wrong.One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.Now, what I want you to do...It's not about hitting it hard.It's how good you hit it.So, watch me.And you can count with me if you want,
just count;on a one count, I hit right through the bag.- Can you show me that again?
- You just...Just say ""one,"" please.- One.
- OK, one.- One.
- OK.Yeah, just say one.
That's good. That's good.Then I move over to my right foot.You'll see my weight is
shifting to my right foot.Then I hit it with the back of my hand,
sort of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.Then I come over,and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.And ice pick maneuver again, and I come
over on my right foot and hit it right, left.Don't watch anything but my feet.One, two, three...Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.Need to show 'em how to
stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.To make a fighter,
you got to strip 'em down to bare wood.Rest when you're dead.Come here.You can't just tell 'em
to ""forget everything you know. ""You got to make 'em forget it in their bones.Left uppercut, left, left.Make 'em so tired they only listen to you,only hear your voice,
only do what you say and nothing else.Move your feet.Move your feet around. Let's see you go.Show 'em how to keep their balanceand take it away from the other guy.Not so low. Look at me.Right hook and just turn right over...How to generate
momentum off your right toeand how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.How to fight backing up,so that the other guy
doesn't want to come after you.Then you got to show 'em all over again -over and over and over till they think
they were born that way.Shift. Shift away. Shift away.OK, that's enough for today.Good work. Good girl.Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?Hey.Hey come here.You're not breathing.Hate to disagree with you.Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.Now, stop doing that.OK.But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?I mean, for a girl.I don't train girls.Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?I'd like to, but you've
been keeping me too busy.Got any family, boss?What?You been spending all this time with me.
I didn't know if you had any.No.Well, I've got a daughter - Katy.That's family.We're not exactly close.How much she weigh?What?Trouble in my family comes by the pound.Yeah.Not very big.Used to be real athletic.Don't know if she kept it up.So what do you think?Am I ready for a fight?Hey, Sally.Come here for a minute, will you?Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, OK?Can I see you a minute?Sally here is a real good manager.
Has a couple Golden Glove boys.Looking for a girl, Sally?I'm looking for a good one.Well, see, there you go.Nice working with you, girlie.- What'd you want?
- Nothing. It's nothing.I ain't lying I been watching you work.
You've got a hell of a left.Thank you.So, you want to give this a try, see if it's a fit?Yeah, sure.Good... cos I think you're ready for a fight.All right.Break!What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.You're doing great. You're wearing her down.
Just keep punching.I ain't doing great. I'm losing.You're wearing her down.Nice night, ain't it?Jesus Christ.That's Lonnie Washington's girl.Hell of a fighter. 11 and 0.Your left. Keep your left up.Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ.Yeah.Your left, damn it!Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight,but Sally's a good manager.He must think she can take her.Jesus H, your left!Keep your left up!You think she can hear you from back here?Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.Might even help him.Lonnie's girl gets another win,Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?Hey, what do I know?I just come cos I enjoy the fights.Mother of God!OK, break!Hey! Come here, come here.Hey get over here!You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter?You're doing a hell of a job of it.
Is this how you advise your lightweight?Dunn, what the hell are you doing?- I'm talking. What you doing?
- This your fighter?It's my fighter!It ain't fitting real well, Sally.Fine. You take her.
She can't fight worth a shit, anyway.Somebody tell me what's going on.I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.You're telling me this is your fighter?Yeah, this is my fighter.Then you got ten seconds.I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it drops.- Well, let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.She thinks she knows you, that's all.Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top,so you just wait for her, see?That's all she's thinking about.And when she cocks
that big right hand, you hear me?And when she does, you step to the side
and come over with this big ""good night"" hook.- Got one?
- Got it right here.OK.- Fight, or I'm calling it.
- Go give it to her.The body knows
what fighters don't - how to protect itself.A neck can only twist so far.Twist it just a hair more and the body says""Hey, I'll take it from here cos you obviously
don't know what you're doing. ""Neutral corner.Two, three, four.- See the way she did that?
- Yeah.Sugar Ray would do that. Girl's got sugar.""Lie down now. Rest and we'll
talk about this when you regain your senses. ""It's called the knockout mechanism.Don't get all carried away, now. Good girl.Thanks, boss.You, uh... You forgot the rule.- Now, what is the rule?
- Keep my left up?It's to protect yourself at all times.Now, what is the rule?Protect myself at all times.Good, good.You gave me away. How's that protecting me?It wasn't.It's OK.I'll work on my left, boss.Drink your water.Other than that, how'd I do?Fine. You did fine.You gonna leave me again?Never.That place you work - do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?Sure.Not the kind with the canned filling crap?Oh, big can, yea size.
It says ""homemade"" on the label.- I want you to take the weekend off.
- It's only Thursday.You gonna argue with me?Know better than to do that, boss.Good.All fighters
are pig-headed some way or other.Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.Can you uh... spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?Truth is even if they're wrong,even if that one thing
is going to be the ruin of them,if you can beat that last bit out of 'em,then they ain't fighters at all.Thought I said I'd see you Monday.You sure did, boss.That was last night.You said not to argue with you.Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.You want my advice?What?Where are your shoes?I'm airing out my feet.You got big holes in your socks.Oh, they're not that big.Didn't I give you money for some new ones?These are my sleeping socks.My feet like a little air at night.How come you're wearing 'em
in the daytime, then?Cos my daytime socks
got too many holes in 'em.Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.Please.Well, I'd be tempted, but I couldn't say for sure.Might find its way to the track.Oh!Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.I got the breathing thing down.No, you ain't breathing because you're knocking
'em out in the first round.Thought that was the point.The point is to get good.Can't get good if you keep knocking 'em out
in the first round.How am I going to get you fights?Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed.Why am I still doing four-rounders boss?Cos you haven't got the lungs for six rounds,
that's why.I do if I keep knocking 'em
out in the first round.Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder,just to let her know who was boss.Three, four, five,six, seven.Sorry, boss.Maggie left no doubt about it.Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.Down!To the corner. Three, four...five,six, seven,eight,nine, ten! It's over!Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.After that no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her
decent fights,sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.But that only worked for so long.Then Frankie did something he hated doing.He took a chance.He moved her up in class.That could've been a mistake.Break. Break. Step back.Time.- Dang.
- Dang.Hey, give us two seconds, will ya?
Just two seconds.- Your nose is broke.
- Dang!- Fix it.
- I can't. I can't.You can fix it.- I can't. I've gotta call it.
- I've seen what you can do. Fix it.I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.The ring doctor's gonna call it.Please. If you can stop the blood, I can beat her.Bite down on this.OK.Inhale.- What?
- Inhale.What?Breathe in.OK, huh?Yeah, it's OK.Yeah. All right.You got 20 seconds before
this turns into a geyserand it's gonna spray all over the front row.20 seconds - that's all you've got.Get goin'.Go to your corner!Two,three, four, five,six, seven,eight,nine, ten!""Mo cuishle. ""Whatcha reading?What's she saying?Wants to know what you're reading.It's Yeats.Keep your head back.Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her?Show her what a treat that is.When the hell they gonna get to her?I'm OK, Frankie.What'd you learn tonight?Always protect myself.- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Here.I'll be right here.How you doin'?- Me?
- Yeah, you.I'm not the one who's hurt.Broken nose don't hurt that much.Why are you telling me that?No reason.But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.Did you write your daughter?Every week.I've no idea why you come to church.After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.The first was to fight Billie, ""The Blue Bear"",
Osterman for the WBA welterweight title.Billie the Blue Bear!Billie was a former
prostitute out of East Berlin.Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.Didn't matter to her,
something like that could kill a person.And the crowds loved her.He turned it down without even telling her.The next was to fight the British champ,
a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.Hello?Not interested.He turned that down too.That's a lot of money, boss.Yeah. You're making money.
What're you still working here for?It's a title match, right?Are you British? It's a title you can't take away.She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.Might still be a good fight.Yeah. I ju... I just brought you up to welterweight.Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.Well, you can get yourself another manager
any time you want.In fact, if you'd learnt
to protect your face a little better,I wouldn't have to turn down this money.My face out there so much,
it's a miracle I ain't been knocked out yet, boss.No you can't work here anymore tonight.I made us a reservation.You um...You might want to shower.Here you go.Here you go.What's this?Well, ain't no big secret what you're wishing for.Go on and blow.Thank you.33 ain't so old.I was still fighting at 39.Fought for 23 years.How's it going, Scrap?Ah, doin' good, Mickey.Doin' good.What are you having?Coffee.You two not speaking?Don't hardly know him.I met Frankie right after my 37th birthday.He was picking up cut work.He used to patch me up when
I thought it was impossible.Good man to have in your corner.Yes, he is.He stayed with me through my last fight
in San Berdoo.My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere and...it was just Frankie and me.I was taking a hellacious beating.Everybody's got a particular number of fights
in 'em.Nobody tells you what that number is.Mine was 109.I just didn't want to admit it.Fourth round, this...this cut opens up.Blood starts pouring into my eye.They should've stopped the fight,but, hell, I was a black man in San Berdoo -blood was what I was there for.Round after round,
I kept getting Frankie to patch me up.He's talking about throwing in the towel,but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.Round after round, he's arguing with me.And I'm almost laughing,cos, hell, it's getting more to him than to me.I go 15 rounds, lose by decision.Next morning, I lose the eye.In 23 years, he's never said a thing about it.Doesn't have to.
I can see it in his face every time he looks at me.Somehow...Frankie thinks he should've stopped that fight.Should've saved my eye.Spends his life wishing
he could take back that 109th fight.See, I wanted to go to 110.Thing is......if you want to get to the title......maybe he's not the one to take you there.You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?Go on and eat your cupcake.No. I got it.It's the rule - always protect yourself.People never take their own advice.If she was going to leave Frankiebetter she did it to him then.Mr. Mickey Mack?I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.I hear you're a... a real good manager.Doing, uh, good things for Big Willie.But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn,so you don't need to make any more excuses
to bump into me.Sorry for interrupting your dinner.Maggie always did like
taking 'em out in the first round.The letters always came
back marked the same way ""Return to Sender"".I will uh... make you some coffee.What are you doing with your money?Saving it.Good girl.You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.Cash, no mortgage.It'll be a while 'fore I can do that.Yeah, well, it might be a stretch,but, uh, you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.Go around wasting it on things that don't matter,
what do you got?You understand?Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.OK soon as I get the money.Well, I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
I'm just trying to keep you from doing the same.I know, boss.I'm not gonna live forever.What is it?It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.If you're gonna go for the title, we got moves to...Hey, hey! Get the hell down.
You know how old I am.Oh, thank you, boss. Thank you so much.You're welcome, darling.Now, just, here let me put this in...
in the machine.What machine?Don't have a TV, huh?No.Yeah!All right. OK.Ten minutes, love.Thank you.Man says he loves me.Well, he's probably not the first one to say that.First since my daddy.I win, you think he'll propose?You win, I'll propose.Look, I've got you a gift here.I- I think they gave you somebody else's.No, no. This is it.What's it mean?I don't know.Something in Gaelic.It's beautiful.Yeah. I thought so.Yeah.Real silk thread.From the United States of
America the challenger Maggie Fitzgerald!Hey! Yeah, yeah, ""Mo cuishle. """"Mo cuishle""!She wasn't the main attraction.She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.But ask someone who was there
they couldn't tell you who else fought that night.Box!Come on, Mo cuishle!Mo cuishle!Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!Mo cuishle!She's tough.I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.- You know why that is?
- Why?She's a better fighter than you are, that's why.She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced.Now, what are you going to do about it?Get in there.Box!Four, five,six, seven,eight, nine, ten!Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!Mo cuishle!Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!I could ask someone, you know?Good.You find out, you let me know.Whatever it meant the name stuck.Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris
Brussels and Amsterdam.It was always ""Mo cuishle"".Seems there are Irish people everywhere
or people who want to be.By the time they came back to the States.- Maggie was in a whole new league....Mo cuishle!
Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle...Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle!After that
they got another offer to fight for the title.- What's the split?
- 60-40.Good.We'll take 60, and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.Ugh! That little girl?You think I'm wrong? Really?You think people are saying
that they want to seesome scabby Kraut beat up
on little Miss What's-Her-Name?You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.Auf Wiedersehen.Well, they're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.How's that girl doing?Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.She'll be all right?And if she isn't?Maybe I should send her something.Well, you could send her your cheque,
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.Boss?That little house we talked about?I bought it.Well, smart girl.For my mama.It's only about a mile from where she lives now.No mortgage, just like you said.You're a good daughter.She don't know about it yet.I was hoping maybe we could stay an extra day,
drive over there?I know she wants to meet you.Yeah. We could do that.Oh, my God.Mama, come on out here. Mary M's here.This is the Johnsons old house.Not anymore.It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.Mary M, you bought this for me?Yeah, all yours, free and clear!Darling.There's no fridge. No stove, neither.They'll be here before you move in.How much money did this cost you?You never mind that.- Oh, you shouldn't have done this.
- You need a decent place.You shouldn't have done it!
You should've asked me first!Darling, government's gonna find out about
this house, they'll stop my welfare.- Mama, no, they ain't.
- Yeah, they are. You're fine, you're working,but I can't live without my welfare.Mama, I-I send you money.What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.How am I supposed to get my medicine?I'll send you more money.I hope you don't expect JD
to move in here with us.He's getting out, you know.Why didn't you just
give me the money?Why'd you have to buy me a house?Didn't have to, Mama.But it's yours.You want the money, sell it.I don't...I know you didn't mean nothing hurtful by this,but sometimes
you just don't think things through.That's true, Mama.I'll try and keep the house.
I just worry about all those expenses.I'll send you some more money.That man hitting you?- It's from the fight.
- Oh.I'm a fighter, Mama.Find a man, Mary M.Live proper.People hear about what you're doing,
and they laugh.Hurts me to tell you, but they...
they laugh at you.Hi.You ever own a dog?Nope.Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.Axel's hindquarters were so bad,he had to drag himself room
to room by his front legs.Me... Me and Mardell'd bust up laughing,watching him scoot across the kitchen floor.Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself,but one morning, he got up
and carried Axel to his rig,and the two of them went off into the woods,
singing and howling.But wasn't till he got home that night, alone,that I saw the...
the shovel in the back of the truck.Sure miss watching the two of them together.I got nobody but you, Frankie.Well, you've got me.At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.Hey, can we stop just up here?Yeah.This place has the best lemon pie around.None of that canned filling crap.Huh.Wow.Mmm.Mm.Now I can die and go to heaven.Mmm.I used to come here with Daddy.Wonder if a place like this is for sale.I got a little bit of savings.That's fine. Fine, thanks.Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?Looks like another bottle of water.Want to come to Vegas with us?Watch you suffer over the nickel slots? Uh-uh.My heart can't take that kind of pounding.Well, she's got a title shot.The Blue Bear.Million dollars, split right down the centre.Oh, that's good, Frankie. That's real good.Well, I could use a good second.
Can't find one. I thought I'd ask you.Why the hell would I want to do that?Well, cos you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.I thought you might like to feel
what it's like to be in the ring on a title match.Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.Nah, you...
you pick up somebody there in Vegas.Somebody with young hands.Well, you're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.I leave this place for one day,got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?Kind of like it looks right now.Oh, go to hell.You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.Will do.Hey, Mr. Scrap.Mm-hm?I got a question, but I feel real stupid asking it.No such thing as a stupid question there,
Danger.OK.How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?I been thinking on it.Can't figure it out.Why don't I show you, Danger?Oh, you could do that? You could show me?I think so.Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.Oh, you do, do you?- Well, I got the tickets. You ready?
- We're flying?Would you rather drive?You're asking me?Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?So, I finally get to decide something?That's what I'm saying.Fine.Fly there, drive back.That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.How the hell we gonna do that?You said it was up to me.Give 'em hell there, Danger.Hey, Old School, the toilet's overflowing.Hey Flippy Come here for a minute.Aw, Jesus.Jesus, Mary and Joseph.Aw...Dumb-ass.Could be sitting up at The Mirage...drinking mai-tais...looking at naked women.Come on. Put up your hands.Time to get out of there.Fight back. Come on!- Back with the left, man. Come on.
- Hey!Come on Flip.
What you doing? Let him go.All right, OK, I've gotcha now.Come on, come on, come on.- Don't need no corner training.
- How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?You did good, Danger. You did real good.You my man. You a rock.Oh, come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.
You ain't even fight good yet.Anybody can lose one fight.
Anybody can lose one, son.You'll come back from this,
be champion of the world.No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.I should've knowed.Come on Old School man.
We don't need to be taught.Oh, no, I can do her, just untie the Velcro for me.All right.Hey, come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.Mind if I... borrow this, Danger?Oh man! I thought your name was Danger.Come on now.Oh, oh, I see.
Now I get to fight a retard and a old man.Call ESPN cos you can't write this shit.Look out, Shawrelle.Easy, Shawrelle.One hundred and ten.Get a job, punk.Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.I got you some pipers.Mo cuishle, mo cuishle,mo cuishle, mo cuishle!I want you to jab her right in the tits
until they turn blue and fall off.Ladies and gentlemen,this is the feature presentation of the evening.In this corner, the challenger, Maggie Fitzgerald,in the red corner.In the blue corner,the WBA Welterweight Champion
of the world, Billie ""The Blue Bear. ""Sweet Jesus.Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!Fitzgerald is pushing the Blue Bear round

to the head and the body.Ooh and a right hook stuns the champ.Break it up.Break it!You do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?OK, go fight.Come on! What the fuck?All right, that's it.
I'm going to take away a point.One point deduction off the blue corner.Ref!Ladies and gentlemen the first round
is in the books in this championship match.OK.- Open it.
- Here you go.You pull that crap one more time,
you're disqualified.It's going to be all right.Got no doubt, boss.OK.OK, you just watch yourself.Stay away from this dame.Come on.Go to the neutral corner. Neutral corner.Stay down, bitch.Seven, eight, nine...Break it! Break it up. Break it! Break it!Fitzgerald continues to pummel the Blue Bear,

- One's enough.Now, what do I do about the Bear?All right, you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?- I been doing that. She's made of steel.
- But I don't want you to go to the liver this time.Hit her right up under her skinny ass.Understand? Right in the sciatic nerve.Just keep digging it in there, digging it in,
and keep sticking her. You hear that?What about the ref?Keep yourself between the ref and the Bear,
and everything'll just be fine.This is yours. You keep it going. You keep it up.OK.Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!Get the doctor!Come on. Breathe.That's it. Breathe.Good Just look at me. Concentrate on me.Breathe.Good.That's it. That's it.Breathe. Good.How you feeling darling?Growing a beard, boss?Yeah, I thought it might help me
with the ladies.Can't say it does.Does it... Does it hurt much?Don't hurt at all.Well, that's good.Where's Frankie?Well, he's, uh...He's out there talking to the doctors.Probably telling them how to do their job.They're telling him I'm a C1 and C2 complete.Means that my spinal cord's so broke,
they'll never be able to fix it.Gonna be frozen like this the rest of my life.I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's going to take it.Did you see the fight?Course I did.You had her cold, Maggie.Well, I shouldn't have dropped my hands.I shouldn't have turned.Always protect myself.How many times he tell me that?Yeah, he... does like to repeat himself.Will you tell him I'm real sorry?No.I won't do no such thing, Maggie.Damnedest thing.So, what's the plan?I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.It's your fault.Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.You kept after me until I trained her.I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.Everything kept telling me not to.Everything but you.I'm gonna get you out of here.These doctors around here don't know squat.Otherwise, why would they be living
out here in the desert?As soon as you're able to be moved,we'll find someplace
where they've actually studied medicine.You just rest there, I'll...I'm on it.Frankie must've called
every hospital in America,looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.He came close twice,
till they checked her over,said there was nothing to be done.Took two months
till she was stable enough to move.They got nurses for that you know.Yeah, but they're amateurs.She developed skin
ulcers because she couldn't change positions.Thank you.They made the six-hour
trip by ambulance.Fly there, drive back.The rehab centre was a nice place.They took good care of Maggie.She wouldn't have complained
if they hadn'tTook several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.Two, three. <i/>One, two, three.Ow...Since she couldn't
breathe on her own,her respirators were always on.Oxygen was pumped into her 24 hours a day.Maggie's mama called
to say they were all coming for a visit.She waited by the window every day
for the next two weeks.You sure?Frankie finally tracked them down,learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.You don't have to hang around all day.Oh... I like it here.I don't mind.In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway, to read my books.Mama'll be here soon,
share some of the burden.Well, it's no burden.Here.Read this.""Ach gra fir oig...?""""E bhreoigh go... ""OK, OK, that's enough.That's terrible.Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.It says, ""I will arise and go now,
and go to Innisfree,and a small cabin built there,
of clay and wattles made.And I shall have some peace there,
for peace comes dropping slow,dropping from the veils of the morning
to where the cricket sings. ""Not bad, huh?You gonna build a cabin, boss?Me?Yeah.You know, when you quit all this.You mean boxing?No. I'll never quit. I...I like the stink too much, I guess.You think? Cos I could see you there real easy,
with your books and lemon pie.How 'bout you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?I could learn how to bake.Eh, well, then, I'll...maybe I'll start looking, then.Yeah.Hi. I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.Where's my little girl?Don't you think you ought to go
back to the hotel and change?She doesn't know you've been here a week
visiting Woody and Mickey.We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is?You must be JD and
you must be the business guy.Look, there's some rides you missed.You just go on back,
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.I drove all the way here to take care of my child,and you're suggesting I'm not a good mother?Mary M can't go nowhere.If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.Margaret Fitzgerald?Right down here. 301.- Come on, Mama.
- Let's go.I saw myself breathing.Like my body was going up and down.I thought ""Well why didn't somebody tell me?"".Your hair needs washing, it's kind of greasy.It's uh... just a...Just some kind of legal thing.What is it?How we all doing here?Sorry, darlin', but we ain't got a lot of time.Mr. Johnsons charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.Why don't you just leave that?
I'll read it to her later.Hey, old man,you part of our family?Stay the hell out of this.Read it to me, Mama.Well, it's just something legal,
to protect your money.Mama, you don't have to worry.The Boxing Commission's paying for all this.
Everything.But what if they don't, Mary M?Mr. Johnson says they can take my house.If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.No doctors, no funeral expenses.Nothing.Look, why don't you just leave it,
and then I'll just read it to her...Mr. Dunn, with respect, this ain't your business.All right. I'll be out in the hall.You been a good daughter, Mary M.You sign that paper, it'll...
take care of your family, the...the way your daddy would've wanted you to.Uh...How do you make your mark?Can you hold a pen?She got to do it with her teeth, Mama.- Huh?
- You got to put it in her mouth.Here you go, honey.Did you see the fight, Mama?Honey, you know how I feel about that.I did pretty good.You lost, Mary M.Ain't your fault, the way I heard it, but you lost.Don't want to lose the rest of what you got left.There you go.What happened to you?Well, what's that supposed to mean?Mama, you take Mardell and JD and get home.'Fore I tell that lawyer there
that you were so worried about your welfare,you never signed
those house papers like you were supposed to.So anytime I feel like it, I can sell that house
from under your fat, lazy, hillbilly asses.And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.Well, maybe... someone ought to count to ten.Don't smell real pretty, does it, Doc?We might have to lose it, Maggie.They took my leg, boss.Yeah.It's gonna be all right, you hear?I always hear your voice, boss.You need anything?Need to know what ""Mo cuishle"" means.Oh. Well, you didn't win.I don't have to tell you.You're the meanest man I ever met.No wonder no-one loves you.You remind me of my daddy.Well, he must've been a...very intelligent, handsome man.You ain't gonna make me
talk no more Yeats, are you?No, I was......looking at this catalogue from City College.I thought I'd get you a wheelchair, maybe the...the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.I got a favor to ask you, boss.Sure.Anything you want.Remember what my daddy did for Axel?Don't even think about that.I can't be like this, Frankie.Not after what I done.I seen the world.People chanted my name.Well......not my name, some damn name you gave me.But they were chanting for me.I was in magazines.You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?I was born two pounds,
one-and-a-half ounces.Daddy used to tell me I fought
to get into this world......and I'd fight my way out.That's all I want to do, Frankie.I just don't wanna fight you to do it.I got what I needed.I got it all.Don't let 'em keep taking it away from me.Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.I can't.Please.Please don't ask me.I'm askin'.I can't.Hello?In the middle of the night
Maggie'd found her own solution.She'd bit her tongue.Stop. Stop.Look at me. Look at me.Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.She came round and ripped 'em out
before Frankie even got there.They stitched her up again,padded the tongue so she couldn't bite.You can't do it. You know that.I do, Father.But you don't know how thick she is,
how hard it was to train her.Other fighters'd do exactly
what you say to 'em and...and she'd ask why this and why that
and then do it her own way, anyway.How she fought for the title, I...It wasn't by anything...Well, it wasn't by listening to me.But that...But now she wants to die,and I just want to keep her with me.Oh.And I swear to God, Father, it's...it's committing a sin by doing it.By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.Know what I mean?How do I get around that?You don't.You step aside, Frankie.You leave her with God.She's not asking for God's help;
she's asking for mine.Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.The only person comes to church that muchis the kind who can't forgive himself
for something.Whatever sins you're carrying,they're nothing compared to this.Forget about God...or Heaven and Hell.If you do this thing, you'll be lost......somewhere so deep......you'll never find yourself again.I think I did it already.We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.I went to see Maggie this morning.You must've been somewhere else.Yeah.You got a fight I don't know about?It wasn't your fault.I was wrong to say that.You're damn right.I found you a fighter,and you made her the best fighter she could be.I killed her.Don't say that.Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.No chance in the world of
being what she needed to be.A year and a half later,
she's fighting for the championship of the world.You did that.People die every day Frankie,mopping floors washing dishes.And you know what their last thought is?""I never got my shot. ""Because of you, Maggie got her shot.If she dies today,
you know what her last thought will be?""I think I did all right. ""I know I could rest with that.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah. Yeah.I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.Yeah.All right.I'm gonna disconnect your air machine,then you're gonna go to sleep.Then I'll give you a shot, and you'll...stay asleep.""Mo cuishle""......means ""my darling, my blood. ""He gave her a single shot.It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.He didn't want her going through this again.Then he walked out.I don't think he had anything left.I went back to the gymand waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later.And that's when a ghost
came through the door.I got to thinking what you said, Mr. Scrap.What was that, Danger?Anybody can lose one fight.That's the truth.Go on, put the gloves on.You missed a lot of training.Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.Frankie never came back at all.Frankie didn't leave
a note and nobody knew where he went.I'd hoped he'd gone to find youand ask you one more time to forgive him,but maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.A place set in the cedars and oak trees.Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.But that's probably wishful thinking.No matter where he is I thought you should
know what kind of man your father really was."

One, two, three, four!Hey, Maggio! Hello!Hiya, Prew.What are you doing over here?Transferred over from Fort Shafter.- You quit the Bugle Corps?
- Yep.- For here?
- I didn't pick it.Oh, you made a very bad mistake.This outfit, they can give back
to General Custer.Yeah?Captain ain't in yet.I'll look around.What do you think you're doin'?- What's your name?
- Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.I heard about you.I heard about you, too, Sergeant.This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself
before sundown.Put up your cue and come along.Grand went to the hospital yesterday.
Did you put him in the sick book?- Did you make out the morning report?
- I didn't have time, Sergeant.You're the company clerk, Mazzioli.Those medics didn't bring back
the sick book till late yesterday.- I'll tend to it right now.
- Thanks. I already done it for you.You're the best bugler
they got over at Shafter.You're the best bugler
they got on this whole island.That's true.I feel for you, pal.But from my position,
I can't quite reach you.Ten-hut!- At ease.
- Morning, sir.Morning, men. Anything special for me
this morning, Sergeant Warden?- I've only a few minutes.
- Yes, sir. New man here.Oh, yes. Come in.Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.Reporting to the company
commander, as ordered.At ease. Where's that service record?Born in Kentucky, enlisted
first at Fort Myer, Virginia.""Bugle Corps, First Bugler.""Prewitt, I always make it a policy
to talk to my new men.Now, I have a fine, smooth-running outfit.If I like a soldier,
he can get to be a noncommissioned officerquicker here than anywhere else.But he has to show me that
he's got it on the ball.What kind of trouble were
you in in the Bugle Corps?- No trouble, sir.
- What made you transfer out then?It was a personal matter.- Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
- Why, yes, sir.Prewitt, you was a corporal
in the Bugle Corps.You took a bust to buck private
to transfer to an infantry outfit.Why? Because you like to hike?Or was it because
you couldn't stand to bugle?It was a personal matter.That's up to the company commander
to decide.Well?I was First Bugler for two years.The topkick had a friend
who transferred in from another outfit.The next day, he was made
First Bugler over me.I was a better bugler.And you asked out on account of that?Maybe it ain't sensible,
but that's the reason.His feelings were hurt.
Kids they send us now!Well, we'll get your stripes back for you,
maybe an extra one for good measure.Do you know why you were assigned
to ""G"" Company?No, sir.I pulled a few strings.
I'm the regimental boxing coach, you know.Yes, sir.I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl
year before last.- You should have won it.
- Thank you, sir.Our regiment got beaten
in the finals last December,but I mean to win this year.All I've needed was a top middleweight.I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.Quit fighting? When? What for?Well, over a year ago.Maybe you heard about
what happened with Dixie Wells?You mean that fellow that got hurt?- Yes, sir.
- Yes, I heard about that.It's too bad. I can understand how you feel.
But those things happen.That's why I decided I would quit, sir.You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed.Our fighting program is
the best morale builder we have.I've got a mighty sour company bugler.- How'd you like the job?
- Not if it means fighting.Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire
a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt.You should know that in the army
it's not the individual that counts.Well, you'll find that we won't put
any pressure on you in my outfit.Just don't make any mistakes in it,
that's all.I've got to go into town.
Anything else for me today, Sergeant?The company fund report has got
to be made out, it's due tomorrow.- You make it out. Is that all?
- No, sir.Well, whatever it is, you fix it up.If there's anything that has
to go in this afternoon, sign my name.- I won't be back.
- Yes, sir.He'd strangle in his own spit
if he didn't have me around hereto swab his throat out for him.Come on.You been in the army what now, Prewitt?
Five years? Five and a half?Yeah.Don't you think it's about time
you got smart?You know what you did just now
when you turned down Dynamite Holmes?You put your head in a noose.
Things are softer for a boxer in this outfit.Otherwise,
you'd better know how to soldier.- I can soldier with any man.This place is gettin' to be like
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.Who is that?She's Captain Holmes' wife.You'll fight, Prewitt.You'll fight because Captain Holmes
wants to be Major Holmes.He's got an idea he'll make it
if he gets a winning team.And if you don't do it for him,
you'll do it for me.'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?The more he's happy, the less he bothers me
and the better I run this company.So we know where we stand, don't we, kid?I know where I stand.
A man don't go his own way, he's nothing.Maybe back in the days of the pioneers
a man could go his own way,but today you've gotta play ball.Leva!Can't I once walk up to the supply room
and find you working with both hands?I can't do no better
on what you people pay me!Draw this man some supplies.
""G"" Company squad room's on the top floor.Get rid of your bags and come back here.Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.
Save you making four or five trips.- Thanks.
- I just hate to see energy wasted.Besides, you'll be needing yours.Looks like a good man.I know his type. He's a hardhead.Her and them sweaters.I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.Not her, Top.
She knows the score like I been tellin' you.- Is that right?
- Listen, not around here.But when I soldiered
at Fort Bliss with Holmes,I heard plenty about this lady, plenty.- You did, huh?
- Okay, not me.But I know some of the guys
she played around with, so don't tell me.I ain't tellin' you. You're tellin' me.- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Morning, ma'am.I'm looking for my husband.Captain Holmes just went into town, ma'am,
on business.He was to have left some things for me.
Do you know anything about them?No, I don't, ma'am.
Anything I can do for you?No, thanks.I'd be glad to help, ma'am.My husband's been telling me
a lot about you, Sergeant.- He says you're very efficient.
- Yes, ma'am.What is it that makes you
so efficient, Sergeant?I was born smart, ma'am.I love that. Well, goodbye, Sergeant.Man, she sure is one, ain't she?- One what?
- One woman.I've seen better.Karen? Karen?- Sorry I'm late.
- It doesn't matter.I got tied up with General Slater.- I bumped into him in the Officer's Club.
- Yeah?- What did the General have to say?
- Success, he said.Success in war, success in peace time.And not a word about my promotion.Sometimes I think
the old man's just waiting to ship me down.Well, if you'd spend less time
buttering generalsand more time with your company,
you'd get that promotion.The company takes care of itself.I went over there today, looking for you.I had some business
to attend to at Kaneohe.That was all right, wasn't it?Of course.
I have no right to inquire into your actions.- That was our agreement.
- Then why bring it up?Because I wanted you to know I'm not
as stupid as you maintain all women are.Now, just what does that mean?- What are you accusing me of now?
- Of nothing.It's no longer any of my business
how many women you go out with, is it?But I wish you could
just be honest about it once.There's no reason I should try
to hide anything, is there?The way things are between us now,what right have you
to always be accusing me?What right?Are you going back to that again?How long will it be, I wonder,
before I'm allowed to live that down?How many times do I have to tell you
it was an accident?Please, Dana. I'm going to bed.Please get out of my bedroom.Captain Holmes says you don't want
to come out and fight for us.That's right.We thought we'd buy you a beer
and talk it over.We're the company boxers.I figured.Man, what I would not give
to have this characterin the corner pool room in my hometown.Box as good as you used to,
we'd be a cinch this year.You ain't forget, division champs
get 10-day furloughs, did you, son?I'm Ike Galovitch,
platoon guide of your platoon.And don't think you're a tough guy,
Prewitt.You no talk now, but out in the field with us
you sing different song.Listen, the guy don't have to fight if he
don't want to without gettin' kicked around.Now, we're playing pool.
Why don't you take off?- You want busted head, Maggio?
- No.Then keep your big nose out altogether.Training season starts next week.
You can pick up your stuff...Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you.I ain't fightin'. I quit fightin'.You guys want to put the screws on,
go right ahead!- I can take anything you can dish out.
- Okay, Prewitt.Thanks.I just hate to see a good guy
get it in the gut.You better get used to it, kid.
You'll probably see a lot of it before you die.You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?Do you know anything
in army regulations says I gotta box?Every boxer in this outfit's a noncom.I guess you've never seen a bunch of 'em
get together and give a man the treatment.What do you mean ""chick""? She's 45.She's still too young for you.Now, listen, Warden, I'm a better man
than you any day, and don't forget it.I won't forget it.What's the deal with him, anyway?With Warden. I don't figure him.Warden?He ain't like the others.He'll make it tough on you.But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,
and he won't come over it.You don't see many
topkicks like him no more.He was with the 15th in Shanghai
when they saw their action.I heard about it
down in the Philippines even.All I know is,
he's the best soldier I ever saw.Hut! Hut! Hut, two, three, four!Hut! Hut!Count, keep count!One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!Prewitt! Get in step, Prewitt!Hut! Hut!Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic.
Get in step!Hut! Hut! Hut!Platoon halt!Order arms!Left face!Prewitt, one step forward march.Prewitt, you march
like a drunken gooney bird.I gotta teach you how to drill.
You stay here.Platoon dismissed!Detail, right face!Trail forward, march!Half left, march!Half right, march!Right flank, march!Left flank, march!To the rear, march! One, two, three!To the rear, march!
Rear, march! Rear, march!Rear, march! Rear, march!
Rear, march! Rear, march!Assemble your weapons. All right, start.A rifle's your best friend.In case it jams in combat,
it could mean life or death.So you gotta learn to strip 'em down
and put 'em back together again blindfolded.Your rear sight's way off.You'd be 50 feet off target at 300 yards.Now, that's what happens when a soldier
don't know how to assemble his rifle.Seven laps around the track, double time,
and keep this rifle at high port.Forward thrust, hold!Draw and recover, hold!Arm thrust, hold!Draw and recover, hold!And rest!Wide open, huh, Prewitt?Maybe seven more laps will teach you
to watch yourself.Are you crazy? I saw what you did!I'm tellin' you, Top,
she's nothin' but trouble.You better keep your mind
off what you're thinking.What do you wanna do,
wind up in Leavenworth?I won't be back in time
to take retreat, Sergeant.- Or reveille, either.
- Yes, sir.All work and no play, Sergeant.All you do is sit around
sweating over papers.There are other things
in the world besides work.- You ought to get out more yourself, Warden.
- I've been considering it.Well, I'm going.
I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.It'll be here when you get back, sir.Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.You'd better step inside,
or you'll get wet.I am wet.If you're looking for the captain,
he isn't here.And if I'm not looking for him?He still isn't here.Well, I'm looking for him.
Do you know where he is?I haven't the slightest idea.Perhaps he's ""in town on business.""That's the way you put it
the other day, isn't it?I got some papers
it's important for him to sign.I'll try phoning him at the club.
Maybe he's there.Don't do that.I never like to disturb
a man when he's drinking.I could use a drink myself.Aren't you gonna ask me in?The liquor's there, Sergeant,
in the cabinet.You're taking an awful chance, you know.
My maid is liable to be home any time.No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.You think of everything,
don't you, Sergeant?I try. In my position, you have to.Are these really important?Yes. But not important to get signed today.
Tomorrow's okay.I got copies at the office,
so it won't be much work to fix them up.That's what I like about you, Sergeant.
You have confidence.It's also what I dislike about you.It's not confidence, ma'am. It's honesty.I just hate to see a beautiful woman
going all to waste.""Waste,"" did you say?There's a subject I might
tell you something about.I know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.You're probably not even remotely aware
of some of them.Would you like to hear?For instance, what about
the house without a child?There's one sort for you.Then there's another.You're doing fine, Sergeant.My husband's off somewhere,and it's raining outside
and we're both drinking now.You've probably only got one thing wrong,
the lady herself.The lady's not what she seems.She's a washout, if you know what I mean.And I'm sure you know what I mean.You gonna cry?Not if I can help it.What are you doing?I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?I don't know, Sergeant. I don't know.Step on it, boy!- Speed it up.
- I'm speedin'.Payday, paydayAll right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?
Knock it off.Angelo, a dollar he's wrong, coming up.Hey, paisan, come here!Sorry, gentlemen,
I already won my bankroll in the latrine.Besides, it's a penny-ante game.All right, what are you covering here?Come on, buddy boy, we're goin' to town.Look, don't let 'em get your goat.We'll just dress up in civvies and we're as
good as the rest of the world, ain't we?Here, wear this.My sister sent it to me.
She buys everything too big.Look, first we'll hit a few bars, see?Then we go to a place of which I'm a member,
the New Congress Club.Girls.You got any prejudices against girls?That's what I thought.Well, now, looks like you're
all primed for a big night, Top.- Hello, Stark.
- Want some company?No, thanks. All tied up.Leva tells me you've been eyeing
the captain's wifelike a hound dog at huntin' time.He has, huh?
What else did that character tell you?She took up with a lot of men
back there at Fort Bliss.Well,
I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.This ain't no story,
'cause I was one of them myself.Not for long, though.
Sure is something strange about that woman.Yeah. Thanks for the tip.See ya.Hello.- I didn't think you were coming.
- Why not? I ain't late.No, I guess you're not.
But then I got here a little early.I must have been overanxious.
You weren't, though, were you?I stopped along the way
for a couple of drinks.You certainly chose
a lovely spot for our meeting.I've had three chances to be picked up
in the last five minutes.Well,
that's par for the course around here.Well, I don't care for it.
I never went in much for back-alley loving.Take it easy.You probably think I'm a tramp.Now, what makes you think
I'd think a thing like that?Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant.If you think this is a mistake,
come right out and say so.Well, I guess it's about time for me
to be getting home, isn't it?- Well, isn't it?
- What's the matter?What started all this anyway?Do you think I'd be here
if I thought it was a mistake?Taking a chance on 20 years in Leavenworthfor making dates with
the company commander's wife?And her actin' like Lady Astor's horse.
And all because I got here on time!Well, on the other hand,
I've got a bathing suit under my dress.Me, too.She's comin'.Why, it's Angelo Maggio!Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.There you are, sweetie pie.
Dues all paid up.Hey, who you got playing the piano there?
A hippo?Oh, Angelo,
I don't think I've met your friend.Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.Oh, you know how I hate it
when you boys are in this condition.You see that, buddy boy?A woman sees a soldier,
and, like that, she figures he's drunk.- Why? You know why?
- Because he is.Well, heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
with the entertainment business.Every respectable place
has to consider its future.Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, you have my solemn
word your future will be safe with us!Angelo is one of my favorites.Annette, dear, take care of this
gentleman for me, will you, please?That'll be four bucks, baby face.Two for initiation fee,
two for this month's dues.What do I get for it?Members are entitled
to all privileges of the club,which includes dancing,
snack bar, soft drink barand gentlemanly relaxation
with the opposite gender,so long as they are gentlemen
and no liquor is permitted.- Got it?
- I got it.Girls, here's some new poison.
This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.- Nice meeting you.
- Hi, there.Don't tell me the princess is your style.This is Suzanne and Roxanne.- Hello, there.
- Would you like to dance, honey?Hey!Much as I adore your company,
I hope I may be allowed to tear myself away.I just saw a few friends at the door,and I can also see
that I will be of no further use to you.Hi. You busy?What's your name?I'm Lorene.Lorene, huh?I haven't seen you in here before.I haven't been in here before.
My friend brought me.He and I, we're stationed out at Schofield.Oh, I didn't think you were a soldier.- What do you mean?
- Well, I...I'm a 30-year man.
I'm in for the whole ride.Well, I suppose it's different when
a fella's gonna make a career of it.Ain't nothin' the matter with a soldier
that ain't the matter with everyone else.I like you just the same.I liked you the minute
I saw Annette bringing you in.You did? It's funny, I came in, I stood there
and saw you sittin' over here.Why don't you knock it off
or put a mute in that thing!I'll play loud as I want, you little wop!Little wop?Mess with me, fat stuff,
and I'll bust you up.You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.- Wait right here for me, will you?
- Yeah, sure.Gentlemen, you know I will not...This little Mussolini here
is tryin' to tell me how...Like to bust my eardrums
with the stinkin' noise!- Let's not be cruel.
- Break it up, Angelo.You men will just have to go
if you can't behave yourselves.- Only my friends call me wop.
- Do you know who that guy is?- What do I care who he is?
- Who is he?Fatso Judson, Sergeant of the Guard
in the stockade.I'm tellin' you, let him alone.I seen him nearly murder a guy once.
He likes it.Okay, bully boy, now you won the war.
Let's dance, huh?Yeah, we'll dance, we'll dance.
First I gotta calm my nerves.Let's go to a phone booth
or something, huh?Where I will unveil a fifth of whiskey I have
here under my loose-flowing sports shirt.Don't get hurt, pal.Your balance has got to be letter perfect.I thought you were gonna wait.- Bill here was telling me about surfboarding.
- Hello, friend.Just sit down and listen.
He describes it thrillingly.Do you know anything about surfboarding?No, nothing. Not a thing.You must be stationed inland, then.
I'm at DeRussy, so I get lots of chances.Yeah, but then we got mountains.Do you know anything
about mountain climbing?A little bit.- You a mountain climber?
- No.Do you know anything
about flying an airplane?I've had a few lessons.I can't fly, either.
What do you know about deep-sea diving?Bill, shall we move into another room?Sure. The air in here seems
to have gotten lousy, hasn't it?- I noticed that.
- Listen, fella...Come on, let's go.How was the deep-sea diver?That was a terrible way you acted.Maybe I was jealous.You're a funny one.What do you dames want?
To tease a man to death?What do you think Mrs. Kipfer hires us for?
She pays us to be nice to all the boys.You're all alike. Is it so important?It is important. We may seem all alike.
We ain't all alike.I'm sorry.Look...Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's parlor
and sit there.She lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special.I'll go ask her.- Then you're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.Because if you're still mad,
I'd just rather we called the whole thing off.You certainly are a funny one.I never knew it could be like this.Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.Nobody?No, nobody.Not even one?
Out of all the men you've been kissed by?Now, that'd take some figuring.- How many men do you think there've been?
- I wouldn't know.- Can't you give me a rough estimate?
- Not without an adding machine.- Do you have your adding machine with you?
- I forgot to bring it.Then I guess you won't find out, will you?Maybe I already know.What's the matter? What are you hinting at?Why? Is there something to hint at?Maybe there's been a long line
of beach parties.- You must be crazy.
- Am I?What about when you and Holmes
were back at Fort Bliss?Did you ever hear of a soldier named Stark?
Maylon Stark?Why, yes.""Why, yes."" You knew him, too, didn't you?Didn't you?I had to go and forget
you were like all the rest of them.Only it's true, ain't it? Well, ain't it?Why don't you tell me about it?
Tell me the story.There's always a story.You don't leave a person anything, do you?Come back here, Sergeant.
I'll tell you the story.You can take it back to the barracks with you.I'd only been married to Dana two years
when I found out he was cheating.And by that time, I was pregnant.
I thought I had something to hope for.I was almost happy
the night the pains began.I remember Dana was going
to an officer's conference.I told him to get home early,
to bring the doctor with him.And maybe he would have, if his conference
hadn't been with a hat check girl.He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.I was lying on the floor.I begged him to go for the doctor,
but he fell on the couch and passed out.The baby was born about an hour later.Of course it was dead. It was a boy.But they worked over me at the hospital.
They fixed me up fine.They even took my appendix out.
They threw that in free.- Karen?
- And one more thing. No more children.Sure, I went out with men after that,
and if I'd ever found one that...Karen, listen to me. Listen.I know.Until I met you,
I didn't think it was possible either.I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own
to get away from my hometown in Oregon.How come?I had a boyfriend.I was a waitress,
and he was from the richest family in town.He just married a girl
suitable for his position.After three years of going around with me.It's a pretty story, isn't it?
Maybe they could write a book about it.They did. Thousands of them.So I left and went to Seattle.I got there and I met a girl
just back from Hawaii,and she said she'd made
a lot of money working there.So I caught the first boat.I've been here a year and two months.You don't like it very much, do you?Oh, I don't like it, but I don't mind it.
Anyway, I won't be here forever.No. Sure. I mean, why should you?I got it all figured out. In another year,
I'll be home with a stocking full of money.And I'll be all set for life.Who is it?I didn't hear no sounds of combat,
so I thought you might want a drink.- You've been hogging the whiskey, Angelo.
- Not me, buddy.It's that Sandra.
She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.I hope there's a cop under that.Keep pourin'. Keep pourin'.No, thanks. I don't drink.
I think it's a weakness.I grant you that.I don't like weakness. Do you?No, I don't like weakness,
but I like to drink.Hey, what are you gonna do, marry this guy?You're grinnin' at him like you're his wife.Get out of here.Okay, okay. I'm goin'.Back to old long-legged Sandra.
I love 'em tall.Acres and acres.Enjoy yourself, paisan.
You need this more than I do.Tomorrow,
you'll be back with the treatment.What does he mean?Hey, that was nice before,
the way you snuggled up in front of him.What's a ""treatment""?Oh, some of the guys puttin' me over
the jumps 'cause I don't want to fight.Fight?Yeah, on a boxing team. I don't want to box.
I don't even want to think about it.Well, why should you have to box?Well, see, I used to fight.Middleweight. And I was pretty good.They know it. Well, anyway...Well, come on, tell me. I want to hear.Well, the thing is, see...I used to work out with this guy Dixie Wells.He was a real good friend of mine.Loved to box.
People on the outside had their eye on him.He was gonna come out of the army
and go right up to the top.Well, one afternoon,
he and I were sparring around in the gym,you know, kind of friendly-like,and he must have been set
pretty flat on his feet,because I caught him with a...No more than ordinary right cross...And he didn't get up, he didn't move.He was in a coma for a week,
and finally he did pull out of it.Only the thing was that he was blind.Well, I went to see him at the hospital
a couple of times,then, finally, I just couldn't go back.The last time, he and I started
talking about fighting, and...He started to cry.And seeing tears coming out of those eyesthat couldn't see anything.I thought I oughta tell you.
Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.From now on, it's no holds barred.They aim to run you right into the stockade
if they got to.Let 'em.I'll help you as much as I can,
but I can't get too far out on a limb.I ain't riskin' losing my stripes.
I like this outfit.So do I. That's funny, ain't it?Yeah. Yeah, that is funny.Keep goin' in a straight line, Prewitt.Keep goin'!All right, that's enough.Okay, Prewitt, bury it.My hitch was up MondayNot a dog soldier no moreI ain't a soldier no moreThey gave me all that moneySo much my pockets is soreOh, my pockets is soreYeah, that a boy!More dough than I can useReenlistment bluesSing it, boys!Time!Clean up the mess, Prewitt!Hurry it up!
You're on fatigue detail, not a vacation!- Come on! Clean it up!
- Clean it up yourself!What?You heard me.
Rub your own nose in it a while.Prewitt, you know better than to talk back
to a noncommissioned officer?Yes, sir.But I've never liked being spit on, sir,
not even by a noncommissioned officer.You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.I don't think so, sir. I think Sergeant
Galovitch owes me an apology.- Corporal Peluso?
- Yes, sir?Have this man roll a full field pack,
extra shoes and helmet,take a bicycle and hike him up to Kolekole
Pass and back, then bring him to me.- Yes, sir.
- All right, Prewitt, let's go.Time!Hold it a minute.Go ahead, Prewitt, and have a cigarette.
I don't like this any more than you do.Thanks.I take it you're ready to apologize
to Sergeant Galovitch now?No, sir, I'm not.Peluso, take him up there again.Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, let's go.You can't be decent to a man like that.
You have to treat him like an animal.Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.Insubordination
to a noncommissioned officer.Yes, sir.- Only it's a shame.
- What is?Well, I was just thinking, sir, It's too bad
you've gotta lose a good middleweight.I don't care. I don't have
to stand for that kind of insolence.No, sir, you sure don't.I'll prepare the papers, then.The only trouble is that even
if he gets just three months,he'll still be in the stockade
when the boxing finals come up.Do you see any other way of breaking him?Well, you could double up
on company punishment, sir.All right. I'll throw the book at him.Yes, sir,
if you think that's the way to do it.Nice goin', Sarge.Keep lookin', Mazzioli, you'll find yourself
scrubbin' this orderly room floor!Comin' through! Watch it!
Me and my waiters are working our tails off.Hot! Hot! H-O-T!How you doing, buddy boy? Better than
being thrown in the stockade, ain't it?How am I doing, Sarge?
I'm a rough man, man.Slow up a little there, Angelo,
so you can stop sweating in the food.Don't hold me back, Sarge.
Don't hold me back.I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.
Well, you'll never make it.- Hiya, Sarge.
- Hiya, Top.Life in a rifle company.You look awful tired, kid.How do you like straight duty?- What makes you think I mind it, Warden?
- I didn't say you minded it.I just said you looked tired.
You know, drawn to a fine edge.Oh, I like this life. It's a great life.If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in.Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?If you didn't put me here,
I'd have no chance to find it, right?Now, there's a man for you.
What do you know?Since you like it so much,
I'll see if I can find some more for you.How about garbage detail?Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.So you did. What about street cleaning?- Yesterday.
- You got a better memory than me.Of course, if you were smart...Yeah, but I ain't smart.I know, but if you were,
you wouldn't have to pull K.P.,or any other fatigue duty, for that matter.If you think you can bribe me into boxing,
Warden, you're wrong.You're wrong. Not you
and Dynamite Holmes and the treatment.How long are you guys gonna keep
breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?You've had him on that extra duty roster
a month already.- I can't see why you...
- Can't you, Pete?What's the matter, you getting soft
in your old age?Maybe I want to teach the kid a lesson.- Maybe you like it.
- Maybe I do.I'm getting sick and tired watching you
being a stooge for Holmes.Yeah, well, you ain't gonna
see it much longer.I'm getting sick and tired of it myself.
I'm through, Pete.Any day now, and I mean it!Listen, if Holmes would let me,
I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.There's half a dozen companies
in this regiment that'd grab me.- And in grade, too.
- Oh, sure.I could be chief of staff, too, only I just
can't think of leaving my old buddies.Where are you going, Little Sir Echo?To take my shower, if the stinking
First Sergeant has no objections.Where'd you think?
To the movies in this towel?Hurry up. We'll get some beer.I wouldn't drink with you
if it was the last beer in the world.I'm buying.That's different.Wow!Rose.You know why I like
to have you serve me beer?So's I can watch you when you walk away.It's in regulations.
You got a right to complain.You got a right to take your case
to the inspector general.Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.No. I ain't gonna complain.They ain't gonna get that satisfaction.Believe it or not, this is one soldier
that's got a real big family.Fifteen of 'em,
'course this is only half of them.You see the gentleman with the handlebars?
That's Mr. Maggio.Mr. Maggio is my father.Never saw anybody so stubborn.How long is it since they
let you go into town?- Six weeks.
- It's liable to be six years.How'd you like it,
six years before you see a dame?Look, why don't you just
mind your own business, huh?And where did you learn to play the bugle?That's my buddy boy!Who's the broad?My sister.Maggio, what are you doin'?- You hit me!
- Yeah, and I'm about to do it again, too.- Why, you dirty wop!
- If you want to fight, take it outside!I'm gonna cut this wop's heart out.Anybody steps in here,
I give it to him first.One step further, Fatso,
and I'm gonna de-brain you. I'll kill...Nobody's gonna do nothin'! Anybody
does any killing around here, I'll do it!- This is a private affair, Warden.
- No, it ain't!This man's in my company!You ain't making two extra weeks'
paperwork for me for nothing.Out for blood, huh?You'd puke your guts out
at the sight of a dead man.Put down that stool. Put it down!Drop that knife.Okay, Fatso,
if it's killing you want, come on.Well, come on.On the floor!Killers, huh? I'd trade the pair
of you for a good Camp Fire girl.Tough monkey.Guys like you end up
in the stockade sooner or later.Someday you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.I'll show you a couple of things.I'm gonna get a breath of air.I'm glad he stopped it.He's a good man.You keep it.Keep it for a souvenir.Okay, I'll keep it.You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?Prewitt.Could you stand a weekend pass?Could I...What about Holmes?Don't worry about Holmes. He signs anything
I put in front of him without reading it.Sure could use it.I hear you gone dippy over some dame
down at the New Congress Club.- What'd you say her name was?
- Lorene.Beautiful name.Hey, paisan!What's holding you up? Let's get going?What's the matter, buddy boy?
Don't you like it here?You got something better to do in town?Look, the bus is leaving right away.
I'm taking the bus, right?Take off. You're talking to a rich man.
I'll hop a taxi.I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.Maggio, get ready for guard.Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.What? I got a pass!Not anymore. Anderson's sick.
You're on guard.I just had guard yesterday. Why me?I'll tell you why you.
You should've gotten dressed faster.I sure never figured
in your giving me the runaround.- They didn't even want to let me in this place.
- We're mobbed, that's why.There's a big crowd from Hickam Field,
and they got in here first.Anyway, what'd you expect,
a brass band to meet you?- No. I did think you'd want to see me.
- I'm busy, can't you see?- Yes, I can see. It's crowded.
- Well, I am.Look, Maggio's gonna be
at the Kalakaua Inn later.Ain't there no way you can get out of here?What's the matter with you?I work here, you know, after all.
Can't you understand?Yes, I do. I understand.
I understand very well.You haven't been around here in weeks,
and now you turn up all of a sudden and...Watch it, Mack! Watch where you're going!Come on out of here.Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?
I can't just walk out.And even if I could, she doesn't like us
to see the boys on the outside.Look, if you feel that way,
just forget about it, okay?You haven't any claims on me, Mister.- You're not my husband, you know.
- There you are, Lorene.I vastly admire your taste, my dear,
but we really need Lorene now.So many of the gentlemen are unattended.
It is such a rush, isn't it?- Yeah.
- One might almost mistake us...For one of those
big political conventions in Philadelphia.- You are coming, Lorene?
- In a minute.- I'm sorry.
- How do you think I feel?I may not get another pass for months.I've been counting on this
like a kid counts on Christmas.But forget it. Forget it. Lorene's busy.
Lorene has got work to do. Lorene's sorry.Oh, stop calling me Lorene!
My name's Alma!- Alma?
- Yes, Alma Burke!Alma?Mrs. Kipfer picked ""Lorene""
out of a perfume ad.She thought it sounded French.Hey, how'd you get away?I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.- But I bet she doesn't believe it.
- I bet she doesn't.- What'll you have?
- A coke, please.Yeah, give her a Coke. Big Coke.It's great you meeting me here, you know?See, I'm just lucky getting in town.- Topkick gave me a break.
- They still pouring it on?Holmes and those others,
they really got me on the edge.- Gee, you must hate the army.
- No, I don't hate the army.But look what it's doing to you.I love the army.But it sure doesn't love you.A man loves a thing,
that don't mean it's gotta love him back.Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.You love a thing,
you've got to be grateful.See, I left home when I was 17.Both my folks is dead, and I didn't belong
no place till I entered the army.If it weren't for the army,
I wouldn't have learned how to bugle.- To bugle?
- Yeah.That's the mouthpiece that I used
when I played a Taps at Arlington.They picked me to play a Taps
at Arlington cemetery on Armistice Day.The president was there.I play the bugle well.Hello, citizens!- Hey, where you been?
- Hi, pals.I've been in three bars,
and I put a dent in all three of them.- Yeah, you look it.
- Give me a nail, Prew. I'm hungry for a nail.What you doing in uniform?I'm thinking of joining the army.Or maybe I'll go to Mexico
and become a cowboy.You want to go with me?You keep on drinking,
you'll be as much use as a melted candle.You're absolutely right.
Bartender, whiskey!Large whiskey.Excuse me. Hey, buddy.Sam!Hey, comin' out, fellas.
The terror of Gimbel's basement.Stand back there, now. Here we go.
A seven for daddy. Five, deuce.Hey, seven.Snake eyes. That's the story of my life.Hey, Prew, that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
around the corner.That's where all those movie stars stay.Listen, paisan, you'd better simmer down.
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.- That's what you say, buddy.
- What do you mean?- They only gave you an overnight pass?
- No pass.No pass at all. They put me on
guard duty, but old Angelo, he foxed 'em.You walked off guard?I checked in,
and I checked right out again.You get your tail right back to the post.
You're in trouble. You know that.Hey, hey, Prew, Prew, I got a good idea.Let's go swimmin'!
We'll go swimming with a movie star.That's what I'm gonna do,
go swim with a movie star!Listen, Angelo...Twenty feet tall!
I'm going swimmin' with a movie star.You'd better go.Hey, Angelo.Jerk, get up. Wake up.I'm awake, I'm awake.
What are you hollering?Yeah, you're awake.
Put your clothes on, all right?Give them back to the Indians.
The Indians need the clothes.All they wear is G-strings.You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.Hey, I am waiting here for a movie star
to come out of the hotel,and I am not going until she shows up.Put your clothes on.Let's get out of here before
we get in trouble, okay?What's the matter with you?
Can't a man get drunk?Can't a man do nothin'?Can't he put his lousy hands
in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?A man gotta be hounded all his life?Well, I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.- I ain't no coward!
- Buddy boy, look.You get dressed, you put your clothes on.- Will you wait for me? I'll get a cab.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.- Will you wait?
- Yeah, you get a cab.Hey, M.P.s! Come and get me, you guys!Here I am!Is that the best you can do?
I bet you guys eat Wheaties!Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?- It's on right now.
- He'll get the stockade sure.Maybe he won't get it.All he did was to get drunk.It's a soldier's nature.
It's almost his sacred duty once in a while.But he walked off guard. He went A.W.O.L.- What're you hanging around here for?
- Can't a man rest?What man? You got no work?
Maybe I can scare you up some.Go on and shoot some pool.
Any word comes through, I'll let you know.Company ""G.""
First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.Yes, sir, I'll have his things in order.He got it. Six months.I'm gonna escape from this dump.Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me,
neither can no lousy stockade.- Shut up.
- Whatever you say, Brownie.Prisoner, halt!Hello, tough monkey.This other girl and I were lucky to rent it.This is a very fashionable district.I have another key made for you.You can use it any time you want to,
even when I'm not here.- Hi.
- Hi.This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.- This is Georgette, my roommate.
- Well, welcome, friend.There hasn't been a man around the house
since the cat died.I belong to the Book Guild Club.
I always take every book.That's the way I get all the dividends.She'll be great for your friend Maggio
when he gets out of the stockade.Yes, he'll be crazy about her.Just sit down and get comfortable.I'll make you a martini
and see what's to cook for dinner.Hey, this is like being married, ain't it?It's better.You okay?Glad you came?Let's get out of here. Don't look around.It can't go on like this much longer.Even when we sneaked
clear across the island tonight,we had to run out like jailbirds.If there was only some way we...Holmes would probably give you a divorce,but he'd never let me
transfer out of his outfit.There is a way.I've been thinking about it.
You've got to become an officer.You can take the new extension course,
the one they passed last May.When you get your commission,
they'd ship you back to the States.An officer?Yes. Then I could divorce Dana
and marry you.I hate officers!
I've always hated officers!Well, that's a fine,
intelligent point of view.Suppose I said I always hated sergeants?
That'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?You sure made a complete study of it.Okay, suppose I did it.
And don't think it's a cinch.Then you'd be getting your divorce here
while I was in the States.We'd be apart maybe six months.
We're sure to be into a war by then.Why don't you tell the truth?You just don't want the responsibility.You're probably not even in love with me.You're crazy! I wish I didn't love you!Maybe I could enjoy life again.So they were married
and lived unhappily ever after.I've never been so miserable in my life
as I have since I met you.Neither have I.I wouldn't trade a minute of it.Neither would I.I'll probably make the lousiest officer
in this man's army you ever saw.You'll make a fine officer.A remarkable officer.Thank you.Come here.Can't you wait until we finish dinner?- Honey?
- What?I want to marry you.You're a funny one.Why? Why is it funny
if a guy wants to marry you?Because I'm a girl you met
at the New Congress Club.That's about two steps up
from the pavement.Well, what am I?
I'm a private no-class dogface.The way most civilians look at that,
that's two steps up from nothing.Prew, I thought we were happy.Why do you want to spoil things?Look,
I've got a year to go before I reenlist.If I can swing sergeant's stripes by then,
they'll let me go back to the States.Then you and I can
go back there together, if you'll wait.How do you expect to become a sergeant
under that Captain Holmes of yours?It's all you can do
to keep out of the stockade.I'll fight.- No, you're not gonna fight.
- It'd be worth it.Prew, it's true we love each other now,we need each other,but back in the States,
it might be different.That ain't the real reason.- All right, it's not.
- What is the real reason?I won't marry you, because I don't want
to be the wife of a soldier.Well, that would be about
the best I could ever do for you.Because nobody's gonna
stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.Because I want to be proper.- Proper?
- Yes, proper.In another year, I'll have
enough money saved,and then I'm gonna go back
to my hometown in Oregon,and I'm gonna build a house
for my mother and myself,and join the country club and take up golf.And I'll meet the proper man
with the proper position,and make a proper wife who can run
a proper home and raise proper children.And I'll be happy
because when you're proper, you're safe.You got guts, honey.I hope you can pull it off.I do mean it when I say I need you,'cause I'm lonely.You think I'm lying, don't you?Nobody ever lies about being lonely.And don't talk to me about a divorce.Why? Because the scandal would spoil
your chances for a promotion?I ask you once more.I want to know who he is
and where you met him.I'm not going to tell you.One thing I know. I know he's a civilian.
You'd be too discreet to pick an army man.I wonder which is hurt more,
your pride or your curiosity?You can't expect to know how
I feel about a thing like this.I wonder why men feel
so differently about it than women.It's just not the same.It's a lovely day.
I think I'll go for a walk.Hey.I hear you just got out of the stockade.It was rugged. I kept my mouth shut,
and I didn't get in no trouble.Did you see Maggio?Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.He's using a billy, too.Places where it won't show,
in the back, in the chest.He's got it down to a system.He kicks him a lot, too.You know how Maggio's taking it?He just keeps spittin' in Fatso's eye.Ain't he a hot one?He's a good man.Well, Fatso can't make a dent in him.But that Fatso, he's smart.He makes sure the O.D. never sees nothing.Why doesn't Maggio go to the O.D. himself?We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.That boy's about
the toughest nut in the woods.You think he's gonna be all right, huh?- Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.
- What do you mean?After Fatso threw him in the hole,
that's solitary,he started talking a couple of times
about how he's gonna escape.He said to tell you
he'll look you up one of these nights.Still on your knees, huh, Prewitt?Well, boxing finals next month.
December 15th.You've still got time
to help us win the championship.Are you proud to be in this company or not?I ain't gonna move around you again.Something tells me
you need a lesson, Prewitt.Maybe I'll give it to you myself.Come on, leave him alone, Ike.
He's in my detail now.You're gonna get in trouble
if you fight around here.- Get back to work, Prew.
- Get out of the way!I'll be glad to put
my recommendation on that, Warden.You've got service, experience, grade.- You'll make an excellent officer.
- Thank you, sir.It'd be a feather in my cap, too.
A man from my company.At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?They're fighting outside, sir.
Galovitch and Prewitt.Prewitt?Galovitch looks like
he's gonna murder him, sir.I'll take care of it.- Don't you want to see?
- No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!Why don't Prew go for his head?He blinded a guy once.
Must be scared of the same thing.The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!- Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!
- I'll fight any way I want!Come on, Prew! Get him!Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?- What's his name, Major?
- Captain Holmes, sir.Ten-hut!At ease. What started this?Prewitt refused order I gave him,
talked back and started a fight.I taught him a lesson.You won't disobey
any more orders in my company, Prewitt.Sir, I'm sorry, sir, but Private Prewitt's not
to blame, Sergeant Galovitch started it.- Thornhill.
- Yes, sir.You're in charge of this detail.
What about it?He's right, sir. Prewitt done nothing.Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.That's all. Let's forget it.
Let's get back to our jobs.All right, back to work.
Let's go. Break it up.If you guys think this means
I'm stepping into a ring, you're wrong.You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.Took my dough to town TuesdayFound me a big feather bedOh, a big feather bed

- A friend.Advance, friend, and be recognized!Ten-hut!Right face! Rear face!On your knees! Scrub the floor!At ease.Hello, kid.
What are you doing out here all by yourself?- I'm gonna get a little drink.
- Sit down. I got a bottle.Thanks, Top.I gotta hand it to you, kid, the way you
beat up old Galovitch this afternoon.Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.Life's crummy, you know it?Yes, sir, it's miserable.
Perfectly miserable.What do you suppose would happen,if a truck was to come along
and run us over?- We'd be dead.
- You'd better not sit here anymore.You'd better get up
and sit over on the side of the road.What? What do you mean, I better?You've got more to live for than I do.
You got your whole company to take care of.You move over, move over
to the other side of the road.- Go on.
- I'm older! It don't matter if I die.But you got your whole life ahead of you.
Now, don't argue.- Go on, get up.
- No, sir, not Prewitt.Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.Okay, we'll stay together.I don't... I couldn't have got up anyway.I got the biggest troubles
in the whole world.In the whole world, huh?Take love.Did you personally ever see any of this love?You'll understand what I mean.This girl, see,she wants me to become...- Become what?
- An officer.Can you see me as an officer?Yeah. Yeah, I can see you as an officer.- You'd be a good officer.
- Well, you both can see more than I can see.I don't wanna be an officer.
I'm happy where I am.I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.You wouldn't want me
to be a guy like Holmes, would you?Well, would you?A man should be what he can do.How's your girl?What's her name again?- Lorene.
- Oh, yeah, Lorene.I remember now.A beautiful name.Beautiful.You two dumb, crazy screwballs!What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?What are you doing
in the middle of the road?My friend Prew and I,
sittin' here discussin' the weather.- Your friend, huh?
- You heard me.Don't you know
you gotta take care of this man?Holmes is bound to get him sooner or later.And he's the best stinkin' soldier
in the whole army.You both got rocks in your head.Angelo, Angelo.I figured you'd be here at Choy's.I done it, Prew.
I escaped, just like I said.Just like I figured.In the back of a truck, under a tarp.They rode me right out,
just like I figured.Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,
about a mile back,and I fell out in the road.You should've seen me bounce.
I must've broke something.Prew. Prew, listen.Fatso done it, Prew.He likes to whack me in the gut.He asks me if it hurts,
and I spit at him like always.Only yesterday, it was bad.He hit me, he hit me, he hit me.I had to get out, Prew. I had to get out.Buddy, buddy.They gonna send you to the stockade, Prew?No, they ain't gonna send me
to the stockade.Watch out for Fatso.Watch out for Fatso.He'll try to crack you.And if they put you in the hole,
don't yell.Don't make a sound.You'll still be yelling
when they come to take you out.Just lay there.Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.He's dead.I'll betcha that's Prewitt.Sergeant Judson?You want me?Yeah, Fatso.I don't like that nickname.You want to see me about something?Let's step around the corner
where we can talk.Okay.- Are you sore about something?
- I don't like the way you play the piano.- Remember Maggio?
- Oh, the wop?Yeah, a real tough monkey.- You killed him.
- Did I?Well, if I did, he asked for it.The army's gonna get you
sooner or later, Fatso.But before they do,
I want a piece of you myself.I figured that.See this knife?It's the one you pulled on Maggio.Prew!What's...Prew!It's all right.Don't worry, don't worry.
I ain't gonna die.First platoon all present and accounted for!Second platoon all present
and accounted for!First platoon all present and accounted for!Second platoon all present
and accounted for!Third platoon all present and accounted for!First platoon all present and accounted for!Company dismissed!Prewitt's still absent.Makes three days now.How long are you gonna
carry him present, Top?- I just mention it.
- Well, don't mention it.""Upon observing these incidents,""an investigation was made
by the Inspector General's department""over a period of several months.""It was found that Captain Holmes
has been guilty of indefensible cruelty""to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.""As mentioned, this included the instigation
of wholly unauthorized tactics""to force the soldier to join
the inter-regiment boxing team.""I'm waiting for your reply.I haven't any, sir.Holmes,
the first thing I learned in the armywas that an officer takes care of his men.It seems to be the first thing that you forgot.My only regret is that
we have to keep you in uniformuntil a court-martial is concluded.If there were any way
to avoid a court-martial, sir.There is one alternative, General,
if you are so disposed.A resignation for the good of the service,
under army regulations.Write a letter of resignation.
Have it on my desk this afternoon.As far as I'm concerned,the quicker you're out of the army,
the better for everybody,especially the army.That's all, Holmes.I know what's been going on in this outfit.I know how far some of you
have been out of line.If you want to remain noncoms,
you'd better snap into it.And another thing, from now on,no man's gonna earn his stripes by boxing.- Get rid of those.
- Yes, sir.Dismissed.- About Sergeant Galovitch.
- Yes, sir.Bust him.
Sergeant Galovitch is now Private Galovitch.Put him in charge of the latrine.What are you grinning at?I think the company commander
made a wise decision, sir.Company ""G,"" Captain Ross.- Just a minute. It's for you, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.Yes, sir?Yes, the parcel has already arrived.What?I've got to see you, Milt. It's important.Okay, I'll get away somehow.
Sure, that'd be fine.Yeah. I'll be there in about an hour.Right.He's being sent back to the States.
He's sailing next week.He wants me to go with him. What'll we do?When do you think
you'll get your commission?I didn't put it in.I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.I took it out of my desk a dozen times,
but I couldn't sign it.Why?But it was the plan.- I know, I know.
- It's been weeks.You can't just say you'll do a thing
and then not do it.Karen, listen to me.But why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you tell me?Be back in a minute.I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.I thought it was a guy from our company,
Prewitt, the kid I was telling you about.The one that got mixed up with
one of the girls at the New Congress Club.He's A.W.O.L. Probably in lots of trouble.Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no good...Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.I can't be anything else.If I try to be an officer,
I'll be putting on an act.I just can't do it.
Please don't ask me why.I know why.You don't have to become
an officer now, Milt,now that Dana's out of the army.You just don't want to marry me.You're already married to the army.I love you, Karen.I know. I know.I don't want you to go back to Holmes.I don't want to either, but I am.There's nothing else for me to do.It's no good with us, Milt.
It could never have been any good.Hiding and sneaking.It had to wear out.Goodbye, Sergeant.- Thanks.
- It ain't goodbye. It's...We'll see each other again somewhere.Of course we will.Somewhere.Here it is.
Got it on an inside page already.""Still no clue in the fatal stabbing
of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson.""Did you hear me?- Trying to set a new world's record?
- Yeah.Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt,holder of the new world's record.- Everything all right, Top?
- Great.This is a beautiful meal
to put in front of a guy on a Sunday morning.Congratulations.- Sure look pretty over them mountains.
- Don't they, though?Sounds like they're dynamiting
down at Wheeler Field.Mighty ambitious, huh?
Sunday morning before 8:00?The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!I seen the red circles on the...Come on, get inside! Hurry up! Go!This is a real attack, not a maneuver.
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.Please keep in your homes.
Do not go on the streets. This is a real attack.Japanese planes are bombing our naval
and army installations.All right, all right, you guys, quiet down.Quiet! Quiet down!Noncoms, get B.A.R.s
and ammunition from the supply room.- Get up on the roof. Henderson.
- Right here, Sarge.You're in charge of the loading detail.
Get moving.Wilson, Dole, let's go.The rest of you men, listen to me.I want every man to get his rifle,
go to his bunk and stay there.And I mean stay there!Shut up!You'll get your ears shot off
if you go outside.You wanna be heroes,
you'll get plenty of chances.There'll probably be Japs
in your lap before night.Now get moving. We're wasting time.Hey, come on. Hurry up.Wait. Into the kitchen
and make a pot of coffee.- Wait a minute. A barrel of coffee!
- Right, Sarge!I don't care.
I can't issue any live ammunitionswithout a signed order from an officer.- But the captain ain't here, you jerk!
- I'm sorry.- No order, no ammo.
- What's the matter, Leva?I got my orders!
Army regulations say that I can't give out...What's the matter, are you blind?
Give me them keys!I obey my orders, Top.Okay, I'll see you get a medal!
Bust it down, boys!I warned ya!Don't go out there, Warden!
You'll get killed!Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!Give him a hand with this ammo.
Put that stuff over there.Watch your fire, boys,
and lead those planes!Friday's gone crazy!
He's blowing the cavalry charge!Here they come, boys!You got him, Pete! You got him!I got him?The danger of an invasion
continues to exist.Infantry units from Schofield Barracks
moved out within a few hoursand have manned beach positions.This is no maneuver.
This is the real McCoy.Look out for falling shrapnel.
Keep under cover.Blackout and curfew restrictions
will be rigidly enforced.Stay in your homes.
Don't use the telephone.Rest assured that immediate relay to you...Prew! We've been to Queen's Hospital
giving blood.The town's a madhouse.There's a big house bombed out
on Kuhio Street.And the drugstore down
on McCully and King is smashed flat.- Man and his wife were killed.
- Your attention, please.Listen to this carefully and keep calm.The danger of an invasion continues to exist,and the planes have been
identified as Japanese.Who do they think they're fighting?They're picking trouble
with the best army in the world.Where are you going?I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to the company.- The company? But why?
- Why?But you can't. You're not well yet.Besides, you're A.W.O.L.
They'll throw you in the stockade.They'll be throwing them out of the stockade.- They need every guy they can get.
- But your side'll open up.They'll find out it was you
who killed that soldier.Once I report in to the company,
they'll take care of me.I'll be all right once I get back.But you'll never make it!
There's patrols all over!I'll make it. I know a shortcut.Prew, stay till morning.Maybe if you stay till morning,
you'll change your mind.Oh, Prew, don't go!I'll do anything you want.We can go back to the States together.
We can even get married.If you go now,
I'll never see you again, I know it.I'm sorry.What do you want to go back
to the army for?What did the army ever
do for you besides treat you like dirtand give you one awful going-over
and get your friend killed?What do you want to go back to the army for?What do I want to go back to the army for?
I'm a soldier.A soldier? A soldier?A regular! From the regular army!
A 30-year man!I gotta turn off the lights
'cause of the blackout outside.They say they've seen parachutists
land up in the hills.I ain't worried about them.
Saboteurs is what worries me.Yeah. I bet they're operating
all over these islands.Halt!Halt!Halt!My hitch was up MondayNot a dog soldier no moreSoldier no moreThey give me all that moneySo much my pockets is soreDo you know this man, Sergeant?Yes, sir.He didn't have any regular identification.They found a card on him with his name.Seems to be a membership in a club.- The New Congress Club.
- Yes, sir.You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.- Was this man a friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.He must've been trying to reach our
company position up the beach here.Then why didn't he halt?He was always a hardhead, sir,
but he was a good soldier.He loved the army
more than any soldier I ever knew.I see. I'm sorry, Sergeant.You just couldn't play it smart, could you?All you had to do was box.
But no, not you, you hardhead.Funny thing is, there ain't gonna be
any boxing championships this year.What's the matter with you?
Ain't you ever seen a dead man?Let's get this body outta here!
We ain't got all night!It's very beautiful, isn't it?I think it's the most beautiful place
I ever saw in my life.I can almost see where I worked from here.There's a legend.If they float in toward shore,
you'll come back someday.If they float out to sea, you won't.I won't come back.You see, my fiancé was
killed on December 7th.Oh, I'm sorry.He was a bomber pilot.He tried to taxi his plane
to the edge of the apron,and the Japs made a direct hit on it.Maybe you read about it in the papers.He was awarded the silver star.They sent it to his mother.She wrote me she wanted me to have it.That's very fine of her.They're very fine people. Southern people.He was named after a general.Robert E. Lee Prewitt.Who?Robert E. Lee Prewitt.Isn't that a silly old name?"

You never got your nose busted.Well, leave it that way... nice and pretty,

I'm gonna go take a steam.You know why? 'Cause I did real good
last night, and you should've seen me.- Big deal.

You ever think about retiring?- No.

They took my locker away.I had that locker for about
six years, but it don't bother me none.Lockers are bad, anyway.After a while,
people get the combination.I must've had 20 bucks taken
out of there in the past six years.It don't sound like much,
but it adds up, you know.Doesn't matter. Who cares.Wow. Cold night.Hey, birds!
Hey, look who's here.Look who's here.
The giant worm.Look at these birds.Don't these birds look like candy,
you know? Like flying candy.Hey, bird,
you wanna fly me home?You need somebody
to walk you home?- No.

I would take a cab or something.Too many creeps
around here, you know.Every other block,
there's a creep.You can always tell a creep.All right. Listen,
I'm gonna go now, okay?I'll see yous later, all right?Don't any of you guys get up.I know you had
a hard day in the cage.So, uh... I'm gonna go home,
make up a joke.I'm gonna tell you a new joke
tomorrow, okay? Good night, Adrian.Good night, Rocky.I don't know
what happens to me.Hey there, Lefty.- I got a friend for you.

who'd you fight?Spider Rico.Is he still around?Yeah, he's doing real good. He's doing
better than you... that's for sure.Hey, Paulie, what,
did you lock the door?Yo, Paulie!I'd like to kill the freakin' moron
who broke the mirror.Hey, yo, Paulie,every day,
every night I pass byyour sister's giving me the shoulder,
you know what I mean?- Forget her.
- What do you mean, forget her?- You can do better than her.
- Forget nothin'.Every night I pass by the place,
I tell a joke.Every morning I pass by the place,
I tell a joke. Nothing.She just looks at me,
you know what I mean?- Looks, huh?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.What... I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?Something wrong with my face?
You know what I mean?- She's a freakin' loser.
- Hey.Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
I could split her head with a razor.Don't get mental, man, you know.- Well, you caught me in a bad mood.
- You're always in a bad mood.Adrian ain't sharp.
Adrian is a loser.- Hey.
- She's pushin' 30 freakin' years old.And if she don't watch out,
she's gonna end up dying alone.- I'm 30 myself.
- Then you're gonna end up dying alone.Hey, I don't need see
no crowd around you, neither.I'd like to kill the freakin' moron
who broke the mirror.Come on, let's get out
of this stink, would you? Come on.- I wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.Why don't you talk
to him about me?Well, I just don't think Gazzo's hirin'
right now, you know? You know?Come on.- The girl's dryin' up.
- Who?My sister. If she don't start livin',
her body's gonna dry up.You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving,
you know that?Why don't you come over
and talk to her?Sure. Beer.Tomorrow you come
for some bird, right?Absolutely. You got it.I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,
she calls the hospital.- Paulie!
- I got it. I got it.<i>Bicentennial fight with
Mac Lee Green here in Philadelphia</i><i>at the fabulous Spectrum.
Harry?</i><i>We're speaking now of your
much publicized bicentennial fight.</i><i>That's right, this is gonna be</i><i>the greatest sporting event
in the country's history.</i><i>A gala occurrence with me
beating Green like he committed a crime.</i>Would you take a look
at that guy?I mean, where are
the real fighters gonna come from?The pros. All we got today
are jig clowns.<i>On January 1st,
the first major event in the country...</i>- Clowns?
- That's right. Clowns.<i>And in keeping with great events
throughout the country's history.</i><i>Apollo Creed will duplicate
the cracking of the liberty bell</i><i>by cracking Mac Lee Green.</i>You callin' Apollo Creed a clown?Well, what else?
Look at him.<i>Stay in school
and use your brain.</i><i>Be a doctor, be a lawyer,
carry a leather briefcase.</i><i>Forget about sports
as a profession.</i><i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i><i>- See, be a thinker, not a stinker.
- Okay, thanks a lot, Champ.</i>Hey, are you crazy?
This man is champion of the world.He took his best shot
and became champ. Huh?What shot did you ever take?Hey, Rocky, you're not happy
with your life, it's nice.But me, I got a business going.
I don't have to take no shots.<i>No one having gone more than...</i>That's right.Stick that up your business.What are you so insulted about?Want me to take a shot?
All right... I'll take a shot.Rocky, how's it been going?Hey, Rocky,
how 'bout a bottle?- No wine.
- Come on. Just a little.Rory, does your brother
know you're hanging out so late?- Screw you, Go-go.
- Her brother knows.Hey, these guys teach you
to talk like that?- Stuff it, man!
- Never say that! Come here!You stink up the neighborhood!- You know, you can...
- Hey!When I was your age,there was only one girl in the
whole neighborhood talked like that.That was it. Just one.
What are you doing?It'll make your teeth yellow.
Don't do that.- I like yellow teeth.
- It'll make your breath like garbage.- Maybe I like garbage.
- Come on, nobody likes garbage.Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...
she wasn't bad-lookin',but, you see, none of the guys
ever took her seriously, see.They never took her out
for any serious datin'.- Why?
- 'Cause that's the way guys are.They laugh when you talk dirty,
they think you're cute,but after a while, you get
a reputation, that's it.You get no respect,
you understand?You get no respect.
And I gotta use a bad word.Whore.
You understand? Whore.See, you use dirty wordsand maybe you end up becoming
a whore, you understand?Come on, Rocky.
I'm just 12.Hey, that don't matter
that you're 12. It don't matter.You don't really have to be one.
You just act like one... that's it. Boom.Hey, if you get a bad rap,
you understand?Twenty years from now,
people are gonna say,""Hey, you remember Marie?""""No, who's she?""""She's the little whore that hung out
at the Atomic Hoagie Shop. """"Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
now I remember her. ""You see, they don't remember you,
they remember the rep.You understand?Hey, you got a boyfriend?No, you ain't got a boyfriend.You know why? Why don't you
think you have a boyfriend?'Cause you're hangin' out with them
coconuts in the corner, understand?You hang around coconuts,
you get nowhere.They're lemons.
Lemons.You hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends, you understand?You hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.You hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.You see?
It's simple mathematics.- I hope you ain't...
- I won't.What was I gonna say?You hope I don't keep acting like
a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?- Yeah, something like that.
- Good night, Rocky.Good night, Marie.
Take care, you know?- Hey, Rocky?
- Yo.Screw you, creep-o!Yeah, who are you
to give advice, creep-o? Huh?Who are you?- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.It says here Mac Lee Greenhas suffered a severely cracked
third metacarpal in his left hand.Damn.Of course, we can
cancel the fight indefinitelyif you're set on fighting Green.Hey, it ain't just Green!What about all the time
Apollo has invested?I believe
we can find a solution.Solution nothin'. You better find me
another ranked contender.And I mean in a flash, Jergens.Don't play games with my client.Apollo's already done
a million dollars worth of publicity,has made contractual obligations
with 20 different organizations...he's not going
to be embarrassed!I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.Ernie's fighting in France
that same week.Then get me Buddy Shaw!
Hell, he's ranked fifth!Went to California
and gained 50 pounds.I get a hold of every
worthwhile contenderand they all say the same thing...five weeks just isn't enough time
to get into shape.Shape nothin', man!
They're afraid.They know everybody in the world's
gonna see this fight,and none of them's
got a prayer of whippin' me.They're makin' excuses
so they don't have to be the chumpto get whipped in front
of the whole civilized world.All I can say
is I'm a good promoter.I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world,and I've broken my ass over this one.But I don't know
what the hell else to do!I do.Without a ranked contender,what this fight is gonna need
is a novelty.This is the land
of opportunity, right?So Apollo Creed,
on January 1st,gives a local underdog fighter
an opportunity.A snow-white underdog,and I'm gonna put his face
on this poster with me.And I'll tell you why.Because I'm sentimental.And a lot of other people
in this country are just as sentimental,and there's nothing they'd like better
than to see Apollo Creedgive a local Philadelphia boya shot at the greatest title in the world
on this country's biggest birthday.Now, that's the way I see it.And that's the way it's gonna be.Apollo, I like it.It's very American.No, Jergens.It's very smart.Okay, I'll see you later, man.- What? What is it?
- I just wanna check this thing out.Now, you said pick up
two yards from Snyderand a grand from Cappoli, right?No, no. No, no. Two yards
from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.- Two yards. Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?Yeah, I got it. Got it.Who's this girl you're going
out with tomorrow night?How'd you know?You know.
Don't you think I hear things?A lot of canaries
flying around the docks.- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.
- Hey, Rocky.- What?
- I hear she's retarded.She ain't retarded.
She's shy, you know?I'll tell you what to do.Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.- This bum gotta say that?
- Who're you calling a bum?- I'm calling you a bum!
- Okay, relax. Relax.Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.He's always in a bad mood.You know, you oughta count
your blessings, Buddy.You're still a healthy person,
you know that?- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours, either!- Kiss my ass!
- Move your shoulders down!- Get out of the car!
- Relax, relax! Relax. My ears.What, are you driving me crazy?
Both of yous.- Buddy doesn't like you.
- Yeah.<i>Some guys, they just hate
for no reason, capisce?</i>- Yeah.
- Come here.There's 50 bucks. You and your girl
Adrian have a nice time, you hear?Thanks.Hey, how'd you know her name?You don't think I hear things?- Hey, Rock.
- What?- Remember what I told you.
- What'd you tell me?Take her to the zoo.- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.What do you think
about Billy Snow?Fouls.How 'bout Big Chuck Smith?- Yeah.
- Nah. He's too old and dull.Hey, Bobby Judd.
He's a good boy.No, I don't feel any heat
from that name.Joe Zach's a good prospect.Exactly what are
you looking for, Apollo?This is what I'm looking for.The Italian Stallion.Rocky Balboa?
Never heard of him.Look, it's the name, man.The Italian Stallion.
The media will eat it up.Now, who discovered America?
An Italian, right?What would be better than to get it on
with one of his descendents?He's a southpaw.I don't want you messing around
with southpaws.- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothin'.I'll drop him in three.Apollo Creed
meets the Italian Stallion.Sounds like a damn monster movie.Hey, what are you doing
with that bat, huh?I used to be deadly at stickball.
You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?She's very excited.- Look at my swollen hands.
- Yeah.The joints from walkin' and
carryin' meat in and out of freezers.It plays hell on the joints.Maybe you oughta see a doctor.
What do you think?I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.Different job. What kind of turkey?
Big turkey or small turkey?Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him
I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.I'd make a great collector.
Bustin' bones don't bother me.Don't bother you.
A big turkey, right? Huh?Gazzo's gotta come... forget Gazzo.
It's a bad job, you know what I mean?- You got a match?
- Go to him for me. As a favor.Yeah. Yeah. You know,
the last time I had a turkeywas when they
were having a $2 specialat Horn and Hardog's
about three years ago.Last year me and the turtles
had spam. What do you think?Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.Your sister knows
I'm coming for sure, right?Yeah, yeah.
She's very excited.I'm all aloneHey, will you forget
about Gazzo, huh?- I don't ask nobody twice.
- I don't ask nobody twice.Stay away, babyHey, your sister... you sure
your sister knows I'm comin'?Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's very excited.Yeah?Paulie? You're late.Called the hospital? She calls
the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.How you doin'?I told you she's very excited.Paulie, why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him here?Look at me.
I'm not ready for this.Would it make a difference
if you were?He's a friend,
and now he's taking you out.No, I can't.You're in the kitchen,
and I want you out right now.Hey.Hey!Hey, I want you
outta here instamatically!I'm sick of seein' you hanging around
like a freakin' spider!Go out! Live!
Enjoy life!Paulie, I can't go!Don't get wise with me,
now, huh?- I'm tired of you being a loser.
- Don't call me that, Paulie!<i>Apollo Creed says he'll
be shopping for another victim</i><i>to fill Green's vacancy for
the bicentennial championship fight.</i>Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?- How do you know I didn't?
- I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!- I won't go!
- Why?!Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'.
I got a turkey in the oven.Oh. A turkey in the oven?A turkey in the oven.You want the bird?Go in the alley
and eat the bird.Oh, Paulie.I want you outta here!
Get outta the house!Go out and enjoy
your freakin' life!You hungry, Rock?Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just
better forget all this, you know?- Just forget it.
- Forget nothin'.Go ahead.
Tell her somethin' funny.Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in
a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.You know how to do funny.
You wanna go out with my sister?- Yeah.
- Well... come on.I don't know what to say.Yo, Adrian,
it's me, Rocky.Rocky, you know?Listen, uh...I don't know what to say,'cause I ain't never talked
to no door before, you know?I mean, what do I say
to a door... hey, listen...Come on.
You're doin' fine.I ain't doin' fine.
I look like an idiot.Keep doin' what you're doin'.
You're funny.I know all about these things.I feel like a jerk.Yo, Adrian,
it's Rocky again, you know?Listen, uh...I know you ain't too happy
at this moment, you know,but could you do me a favor?I ain't got nobody to spend
Thanksgiving with, you know?So, uh...how 'bout maybe you and I maybe
go out together, get something to eat.I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?Would you like to, uh...I don't know. Would you like to maybe,
you know, you and me go out together?What do you think?
Would you like to?We're gonna have a good time.We'll have a real good time.Thanks for the bird.I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.- What does your sister like to do?
- Ice skate.Adrian, come on.
You're lettin' the heat out.Who pays the bills around here?Listen, I don't want
no turkey anyway, you know?But it was Thanksgiving.- It was what?
- It was Thanksgiving.Yeah, to you.
But to me it's Thursday.- It looks kinda quiet, you know?
- I think it's closed.No, I think maybe we're just early
or something like that.- Yo!
- Yo!- We're closed.
- What?I said we're closed.Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna
smooth this guy out here.So just wait here for a few minutes.
I'll be right back, okay?- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's okay.Hey, listen, are you closed
to the general public,or are you closed to everybody...
you know what I mean?Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.And besides, you ain't
supposed to be in here.So do me a favor
and not stay here, huh?- Would you do me a favor?
- Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.Look... this girl here
ain't feelin' well, you know.The doctors say she should go out
and exercise once in a while,and ice skating's probably
the best thing, know what I mean?So what do you want from me?I want you to do me a favor.
You could see she ain't feelin' too good.If you could let her on the ice,
I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.Ten minutes, ten bucks.Ten bucks? How 'bout eight...
eight bucks?Come on. It's Thanksgiving.All right, nine bucks,
you got a deal.You have the ice to yourself.
Ten bucks.Give her the blades.Aren't you skating?Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.That's when I started fightin'...
when I was 15.Skating's kinda bad
for the ankles, you know?Yeah.You're a pretty good skater,
are you?You know, like I was saying before
on the way over here.Fightin' used to be tops
with me, but no more, you know?All I wanted to do at a fight
was prove I was no bum...that I had the stuff
to make a good pro, you know?You never got the chance?Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause I
still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.I tell you what the trouble is...
I'm a southpaw.- What's a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you're left-handed.And a southpaw
throws your timing off, you see.Other guys it throws their timing off,
makes them look awkward.Nobody wants to look awkward.- You know where southpaw came from?
- Nine minutes!I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...
maybe a couple hundred years ago...he was fightin' in the...
I think it was around Philadelphia...and his arm... he was left-handed,and his arm was facing towards
New Jersey, you see, and that's south.So then that's why they
call 'em southpaw, you see?Southpaw, South Jersey.
South Camden, southpaw.You know what I mean?I don't know. Things probably
worked out for the best, don't you think?Never got a chance, though,
because you're left-handed, huh?Well, that's absolutely true,
you know. Watch out.I just dislocated my finger.Look at that. No, wait.
Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.See? Look, I had it...
it's an old wound, you see that?Look. See?
Nothin'. It bends like that, see?I originally done it...
look, push the button.Bong. It works.
It ain't your fault.- Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.
- Seven minutes!Yeah, I originally done it.
I carry pictures of all my fights.I originally done it
in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.
I broke both my hands on his face.I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think? See how it works there?Real nice.Come on.
You having a good time?I'll tell you... you could see
I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you
know what I mean? I can really hit hard.But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants
to fight no southpaw, know what mean?Huh?You know how I
got started in fightin'?- Huh?
- No.Am I talkin' too loud?- No.
- Three minutes!My father... he's, uh...
my old man, he was never too smart.He says to me, ""You weren't born
with much of a brain,so you better start using
your body,"" right?So I become a fighter.Oh.- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.Why are you...
why are you laughin'?My mother...
she said the opposite thing.What'd she say?
What'd she say, the opposite?She said you weren't born
with much of a body,so you better develop your brain.Did she say that?Yo! Time!Can I ask you a question?Absolutely.- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.Eh, oh.Don't fall! Don't fall!Hey, that was terrific.
I'm pretty good at this.You like the way I skate?The last fight I had, I had
with this guy named Spider Rico.He busted my head up.
You see that scar?I'll tell ya...
things get pretty rough in the ring.You know, with some people,
I'm very shy by nature, you know?I suppose.I say you're very shy
by nature, you know?I suppose.Ey! Ey.
The bum from the dark.Get a job, you bum!You know, some people think
that being shy is a disease,but it don't bother me none.It don't bother me, either.Then why'd I bother
bringing it up, huh?'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.I think we make
a real sharp couple of coconuts.I'm dumb, you're shy.
What do you think, huh?I don't understand why anybody
would wanna be a fighter.Hey, you gotta be a moron.You gotta be a moron to wanna be
a fighter, you know what I mean?It's a racket where you're
almost guaranteed to end up a bum.- I don't think you're a bum.
- Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?But I'll tell ya somethin'.The worst thing about fightin'
is the mornin' after, you know?- The mornin' after?
- I'll tell you. Yeah.The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing
but a large wound, know what I mean?Sometimes I got pains
all over me.I feel like callin' a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,your face is all busted up,
your hands are swollen, you know?Look at this face.
64 fights. Look at that nose.See that nose?That nose ain't never been broken.
64 fights.I've had guys bustin' on it,
I had guys chewin' on it,twistin' it, punchin' it...
I mean, whack! Boom!These guys,
they hittin' my nose all the time.Never broken. I'm very proud of that.
Isn't that rare? That's rare.- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why do you think?'Cause... you can't sing and dance.Yeah, somethin' like that.
Somethin' like that.Hey, you wanna come inside?No. I gotta go.Hey, come on.
Hey, I got some animals.I got these rare... very rare
animals inside. Come on. Come on in.No, no. I gotta go.Well, I gotta go, too.
I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.Come on.- No, I gotta go.
- Hey, look at this face.Is that a face you could trust
or what? Huh? Is it?They oughta stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?Come on. Come on in.Yo. Come on.Click.Yo, Adrian, are you hungry?No.I got some things in there. If you
like soda, some donuts or something.A couple cupcakes.
Huh? No?I think I got
some chocolate in there.No?Hot in here, you know?I could go for some music.Yo, Adrian.These are the exotic animals
I was tellin' you about.These are my friends
Cuff and Link.I sold 'em to you.Sure, I know you sold them to me.Remember you were workin'
at that pet shop, huh?First day you was there, I came in
and bought both these animals, huh?Yeah, I remember that.I came and I bought this bowland I bought the, uh, bought
the animals themselves, some food,the marbles that go
in the bottom there.Remember?
Remember that mountain?I had to get rid of that mountain, though,
'cause they kept falling over and flipping.Yo, why don't you
come on over here and sit down?Hmm?It's a nice couch.
I don't know.There's big bugs in there, you know.
It's safer over here.You wanna sit down?Uh, these...
these your parents?Yeah, that's...
that's both of them there.Is this you?Yeah, that's me
when I was eight years old.That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.Why don't you come on over
and make yourself comfortable? Relax.Do you have a phone?No, I ain't got no phone.I had it pulled 'cause of people
calling all the time, and, uh,who needs the aggravation,
right? The interruptions.Who'd you wanna call?I wanna let my brother
know where I am.Why?I think he might be worried.Well, I'll call your brother,
if that's the problem.Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me!
I'll call yous back later!See ya!What's the matter?
You don't like the room, do ya.It's fine.Well, it's only temporary,
you know.It's not that.What's the problem?You don't like me?You don't like the turtles?
What's the problem?- I don't think I belong here.
- It's okay.I don't belong here.Well, you know, it's okay,
'cause you're my guest.I don't...
know you well enough.I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.Well, I...
they're all the same. You know.I'm not sure I know you well enough.I don't feel comfortable.Yo, Adrian, you know,
I ain't so comfortable either.I should go.Don't go, please.
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.Don't go.Do me a favor?What?Take off these glasses.You have nice eyes.Do me another favor?Would you take off that hat?I always knew you was pretty.- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.I ain't teasin' ya.I just...
wanna kiss you.You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't want.But I wanna kiss you.Worm, I heard
you had a fight comin' up.Yeah, I'm gonna fight
next month.That's good, man. You come down to
the gym, we'll see that you get in shape.How's your weight?- I weigh 175.
- Hey, Rock. How you doin', babe?- Hey.
- Oh, Mick was lookin' for you up there.- For me?
- Yeah.- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.He was lookin' for you, Jack.
Get on up there and see him.Yeah. It ain't locked, right?- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, go on, man.Hey, you got somethin' for me?Yeah, there was some guy here
from Miles Jergens lookin' for you.They need sparring partners
for Apollo Creed.- You're puttin' me on.
- There's the card.- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.They're probably lookin' for
sparrin' partners for Creed, you know?I said that before,
you dumb dago!I've been comin' here for six years,
and six years you been stickin' it to me.I wanna know how come.You don't wanna know.Yeah, I wanna know how come.- You wanna know?
- I wanna know!Okay, I'm gonna tell ya!'Cause you had the talent
to become a good fighter,and instead of that,you became a leg-breaker
to some cheap, second-rate loan shark.It's a livin'.It's a waste of life!Yes, may I help you?Oh! You must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
Mr. Jergens is expecting you.Just a moment.Mr. Rocky Balboa
to see you, sir.Fine.- Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can I have that?Oh, certainly.Thanks.Mr. Balboa.How are you?
George Jergens.Take a chair, please.Thanks.Mr. Balboa.- Call me Rocky.
- Rocky.Tell me, Rocky,
you got any representation?You have a manager?- No. It's just me.
- Oh.Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.- Uh, sparrin'?
- Beg your pardon?Well, it's just I know
you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,and I just wanna say
I'm very available, you know.I'm sure you are.Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ
would be an honor.- And you know what, Mr. Jergens?
- What?I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either.
I'd really be a good sparring partner.You don't understand me, Rocky.My proposition is this...Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creedfor the World
Heavyweight Championship?No.Listen, Rocky...Apollo's seen you fight.He likes you.
He wants to fight you.Well, it's just that, you see, uh...I fight in clubs, you know.
I'm really a ham-and-egger.This guy... he's the best, and, uh,
it wouldn't be such a good fight.But thank you very much,
you know.I appreciate it and all that.Rocky? Do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?Yeah.Apollo Creed does.And he's gonna prove it
to the whole worldby giving an unknown
a shot at the title.And that unknown is you.He picked you, Rocky.Rocky, it's the chance
of a lifetime.You can't pass it by.What do you say?<i>All right, fellas, fellas.
That's enough pictures.</i><i>We wanna ask Apollo
a few questions.</i><i>Apollo, how do you like
the city of brotherly love?</i><i>Well, just being in Philadelphia
makes me feel patriotic.</i><i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i><i>comin' up to me on the street
wishing me the best.</i><i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,
and I'm proud to be an American.</i><i>Champ, Apollo,
why did you agree to fight a man</i><i>who has virtually
no chance of winning?</i><i>Look, if history proves one thing,</i><i>American history proves
that everybody's got a chance to win.</i><i>Didn't you guys ever hear
of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i><i>- Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.
- Yes?</i><i>It is a coincidence
that you're fighting a white man</i><i>on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?</i><i>I don't know about that.</i><i>Is it a coincidence
that he's fighting a black man</i><i>on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?</i><i>Right on!
Tell the truth, brother!</i><i>Listen, Apollo, tell me... how do you
feel about your challenger?</i><i>- How do I feel about him?
- Yeah.</i><i>What do you mean?
Come here, Rock.</i><i>My main man,
Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i><i>Yeah, I'm Italian.</i><i>Well, now, what does that mean?</i><i>It means if he can't fight,
I bet he can cook.</i><i>All right, Rocky.</i>Do me a favor.
His lungs... punch 'em out.Paulie.<i>But, Rocky, how do you expect
to fight Apollo Creed?</i><i>Uh, well, geez, you know.
Creed's the best.</i><i>I guess I'll have to do
the best I can.</i><i>Tell me, Rocky,
just between us...</i><i>where did you get the name
""Italian Stallion""?</i><i>Oh... uh, I invented that
about eight years ago</i><i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i><i>Rocky, now your payday
will be $150.000.</i><i>Any comment?</i><i>You... you got no comment,
Rocky, right? No comment.</i><i>Right.
Thank you, Rocky.</i><i>Wait a minute. I just wanna
say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i><i>- I, uh...
- Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i><i>Look at this. Can you believe
all this? They put a microphone on me.</i><i>- You didn't.
- Thank you, Rocky.</i><i>- Quit pushin', man!
- Thank you, Rocky.</i>Don't it matter he's makin' you
out a fool? I'd break his lips.- He's taking cheap shots.
- It don't bother me none.Yo, Rock... I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.- Help in what?
- Keep you livin' the clean life.I'll do okay. You know.You need someone to help
with the exercise,and someone standing by with a towel,
or runnin' errands. You know.Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared
about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.So I just think I'm
gonna train myself, you know.Without such good people
around to help,you don't have
such a good chance.Einstein flunked out of school twice.That so?Yeah.Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.I think Rocky's
got a good chance.Want me to get you
a beer, Paulie?Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed?
Keep out of my freakin' life!- What'd I do?
- Nothin'.- What? Did I say something wrong?
- You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.That's right... you didn't say nothin'!
Nothin' at all!- I gotta go.
- Oh.Where's the freakin' pretzels?!I got the pretzels!
Hey! We ain't got any beer?I thought you were supposed
to pick up some beer.How'd you like hearing
your name on TV tonight?I was shocked.
Why'd you do that?Come on.
You're puttin' me on, right?Absolutely.What time should I expect you?Oh, about 7:00.Hey.Hey...You know how I said that stuff
on TV didn't bother me none?Yeah.It did.Listen, the reason I brought you here
is because, uh...I wanna know if you got any money
for training expenses, eh?I got a few dollars.A few bucks? Well, here.
Put this in your glove.- What's this?
- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.You know, you ain't never
had any luck,but I think this time Lady Luck may be
in your corner. What do you think?Maybe. Maybe.Hey, thanks for the money,
Tony, you know.It's okay. Don't worry about it.
See ya, all right?- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?You're in training, huh?
Come on.Hey.- Yo, Tony.
- What?You gonna show up at the fight?Ringside.Hey, ey.I'll see ya.Yeah?Hello, kid. I seen your light.
Can I come in?- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, good.Hey, it's a nice place here.All right, anyway,
what I come to tell you is that, uh...that what happened to you
is freak luck.- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.Now, they're good fighters, right?
They're colorful, they got good records.They fight their guts out
for peanuts.But you...
you get a shot at the title.Freak luck is a strange thing.Yeah, sure it is.
Can I sit down?Yeah, sure.What the hell are those?Oh, those are domestic turtles.The one on the top is Cuff
and the other guy's Link.The rest of them are marbles.Yeah? They make good soup,
don't they?Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya
that you gotta be very carefulabout this shot
that you got at the title,because, I don't know,
like the Bible says...you ain't gonna get
a second chance.Yeah. All right.You thought of that, huh?Well, what you need
is a manager.A manager.
Listen to me.I know because I've been
in this racket for 50 years.- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years.God, I've seen it all.
All of it.- You know what I done?
- What?I have done it all.You shoulda seen me when I
knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.Outta the goddamn ring.
That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.And it was the same night that Firpo
knocks Dempsey outta the ring.The same night. So, who gets
the publicity? Figure that out.- Dempsey.
- That's right. But why?- 'Cause he was Champ.
- No! Because he had a manager.I had nothin', man.I wanna show you somethin'.
Look at my face for a minute.Look at this.
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.I got 34 stitches over this eye.You know what?
I had my nose busted 17 times.The last time was
with that fight with Sailor Mike.I got that clip in here.
That was a good fight.You wanna read that?You... oh, it doesn't matter.Anyway, he put this vegetation
on my ear.Ah, Rocky Marciano.You know, you kinda remind me
of the Rock, you know that?You really think so?That's right. You move like him,
and you got heart like he did.Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?Uh... anyway,you know, when I begun
in this business, kid...Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.You know, it's no good for you.If you don't mind my sayin'.Anyway, you know,
when I started this racket,pugs like us,
we was treated like dogs.For ten bucks,
you gotta tear somebody's throat out.But I never had no management.
You know...One time,
this... this son of a bitch that I fought,he put a nail right there.- Thumb.
- The thumb, yeah. In the glove.And he punched
so many holes in my face.I had the spit
shootin' out of my cheeks.Can you imagine that?Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like
when I was, uh, in my prime.I want you to look at some...
will you look at that? Look at that.That's the way I looked...
before these guys got at me.That's nice. You take very
good care of the picture, though.But I never had...I never had no management...
that's the trouble!But now I got all this knowledge.
I got it up here.Now I wanna give it to you!I wanna give you this knowledge.
I wanna take care of you.I wanna make sure that all this shit that
happened to me doesn't happen to you.You know what I mean?The fight's set.Listen to me.
I wanna be your manager.- You follow that, do you?
- The fight's set. I don't need a manager.But you can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.I mean, I've got pain
and I've got experience.Well, I got pain
and I got experience, too.Listen, kid...- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.
- What?I needed your help about
ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?- Right.
- You never helped me. You didn't care.Well, if you wanted help...I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you ask?Why didn't you
just ask me, kid?<i>Look, I asked,
but you never heard nothin'!</i>Well, I...I, uh...I know I...
I'm 76 years old.And, uh... well.Where the hell is...Took you long enough to get here.Took you ten years
to come to my house?Huh, what's the matter?
You don't like my house?Does my house stink?That's right... it stinks!<i>I didn't have no favors from you!</i><i>Don't slum around me!</i>Talkin' about your prime.What about my prime, Mick?!<i>At least you had a prime!</i>I didn't have no prime.
I didn't have nothin'!Leg's are goin', everything is goin',
Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.Guy comes up, offers me a fight.
Big deal.Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.<i>I wouldn't wanna fight. Know what's
gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get that!</i>I'm gonna get that!And you wanna be ringside
to see it? Do ya?You wanna help me out?<i>Huh? Do you wanna see me
get my face kicked in?!</i><i>Legs ain't workin',
nothing's workin',</i><i>but they go.
""Go on, fight the champ. ""</i>Yeah, I'll fight him.Get my face kicked in.And you come around here.
You wanna move in here with me?!Come on in!
It's a nice house!Real nice.
Come on in and move. It stinks!This whole place stinks.<i>You wanna help me out?
Well, help me out!</i><i>Come on, help me out.
I'm standin' here!</i><i>It's only about 28 degrees.
We'll check that forecast in just a minute.</i><i>I feel very mischievous.
Very weird. Very...</i><i>Well, the thing is,
I got vinyl seats in my car.</i><i>When I hit the seats this morning,
I just went. ""Whew!""</i><i>I'm thinkin', if I'm up,</i><i>everybody in the Delaware Valley
should be up. Do you agree with me?</i><i>I mean, at three minutes past 4:00,
what else are you gonna do?</i><i>- Hello?
- Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i><i>This is Don Cannon,
W- I-B-G Philadelphia.</i><i>- How are you this morning?
- Huh?</i><i>- Mrs. Kramer?
- What?!</i><i>I think you have a lot of nerve calling me
at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!</i><i>W-I-B-G</i><i>Philadelphia</i><i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,
and it's a good morning.</i><i>I tell ya, I need someone to snuggle with,
28 degrees. It's cold out there.</i><i>We deserve it. We've been getting away
with murder the last couple weeks.</i><i>Our high today could possibly
be 58, and that's it.</i><i>Tonight we're back down
on the 20 degree range,</i><i>a little colder in the suburbs,
and tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i><i>we may hit 40 somewhere.</i><i>But it's 28, it's awfully chilly.</i><i>Make sure you have it
snuggled on before you bring it out.</i>Come on.Stinks in... hey, come on.
It stinks in here, you know.Yeah... I know.Hey, did you kill all these things?No. Across the street.This place is like
an animal morgue, you know?- It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
- Yeah.Who killed all these things?What, are you crazy, Paulie?If you don't pay Gazzo,
you end up on the hook.Come on, Gazzo's a good man.
You know that.Hey, don't get excited.
I know that.That's why I want you to talk to him
about me... the collectin' job.Get me out
of this stinkin' freezer.Why don't you do yourself a favor?Why don't you keep this job,
because you eat better, you know?Moo.Does it ever snow in here?Uh... you and my sister.How you gettin' along together?How do you think?Well, I'm not sure, Rock.
What's the story?About what?What's the story?
What's happening?Do you really like her?Sure, I like her.I don't see it.
What's the attraction?I don't know.
It fills gaps, I guess.- What's gaps?
- I don't know. Gaps.She's got gaps, I got gaps.
Together, we fill gaps. I don't know.You ballin' her?Hey.Hey, you don't talk dirty
about your sister.Are you screwin' my sister?You see? That's why I can't connect
you with Gazzo, you know that, Paulie?Because you got a big mouth,
you know. You just talk too much.It's gettin' cold in here.
I'm going home.Cold in here?!
It is cold in here!It stinks in here,
and you stink!Hey, you're breakin' the ribs.If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.I'll see ya tomorrow morning, okay?- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.You know, your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just... I'm just sore, okay?I'll just... just sit here.- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.Hey, come on.
No foolin' around, all right?I'm tired.Hey, Adrian,
I'm serious now.There's no foolin' around during training,
understand? I wanna stay strong.- You're not kiddin'?
- No, I ain't kiddin'.- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.Listen, why don't you
just make the meat, okay?Okay, I'll make the meat.Yo.- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.Hey.Right, right.
Left, left.Underneath.
Come on, underneath.Underneath, underneath,
underneath. Come on!Hold it. Hold it.Hold it, Rock, will ya?
You drive me crazy.You're so sloppy
because you're off balance.Let's try this. Now, take this string.
Tie it to both ankles.Leave about two feet of slack.I ain't never had good footwork.Never mind footwork.
Now you're all balanced.Marciano had the same problem,
and this string cured it.Here's the idea...that if you can move and you can hit
without breaking the string,you got balance.You become
a very dangerous person.- You follow?
- You're lookin' good, Rock.- Thanks.
- Let's go.That's it. That's it.
Underneath.- Hey, Rock.
- What?- How 'bout you give us your autograph?
- Get outta here!Don't you ever interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.Move your little
chicken asses out of here.Listen, kid. You!
You lay off that pet shop dame.Women weaken legs.Yeah, but I really like
this girl, you know?Then let her train ya!- Okay, no more foolin' around.
- Okay. Now hit it.Women weaken legs, huh?- Yo, Rock.
- Yo, Rocky.Yo.Yo.Yo, you look great.- Really?
- Oh, yeah.Terrific. I mean,
you could be a heartbreaker.You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts,the way you're lookin'...
very sharp.I got... I got another surprise for you.What?Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus!
Come here, kid! Come here!To keep you company
when you run.Come on in and meet the family.
The owner ever come back?- He's yours. He's yours if you want him.
- Do I want him? Come here!What's he eat... this dog?- He eats little turtles.
- Yo, Butkus!What's that, Butkus, huh?
Whose truck is this? Come on.One call from me,
you're a celebrity.- You're gonna need exposure.
- Oh, don't breathe on me, Paulie!That's the big time!
Don't I know about these things?You don't know nothin'!
What do these guys want from me?To watch you train! Boom.What is the matter with you, Paulie?
This was supposed to be private.- I'm doin' you a favor!
- You ain't doin' me no favors!You're embarrassin' me
in front of everybody,you make me look bad
in front of your sister...You see this cigar? I'll stick it
in your ear. Don't do these things to me!You should've called me up
or something... leave a message.Don't do that!My sister really likes you.I'm gonna kill you one of these days,
I swear to God!Come on. Come on.- Baby!
- Baby.Here he is, the next
heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.Listen, we wanna get a brief interview
with you. It won't take long.- What about me?
- What about you?- I'm in charge of the meat.
- Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?Listen, just settle yourself in.
Just relax.What we're going to do is
just ask you a few questions, Rocky.Just a few questions
about your unique training method.Talk to the folks at home.They really wanna know
how you got into this.I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.Jimmy, you guys ready?
Let's roll.Rocky, why don't you turn
right around here.Just don't take no cheap shots,
you know?No, I won't do that.
Just relax, Rocky.Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.- The reason we're standing...
- The meat guy's stickin' his face in.Let's try it again, Rocky.<i>Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i><i>The reason we're standing
in this refrigerated box</i><i>is that Mr. Balboa has
an unusual method of training.</i><i>In a moment,
he's going to demonstrate that</i><i>for the viewing audience at home.</i><i>But first, Rocky, how did you
come to train in an icebox?</i><i>Uh, well, my friend...
the guy over there...</i><i>let me in one day and I hit
the beef here and kinda liked it.</i><i>And since I become a challenger,
the owner don't mind that I come in.</i><i>Is this a common training method?
Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i><i>No, I think I invented it.</i>Don't forget to confirm the reservation
for my people at ringside,and be sure
to fly my barber to Philly.How much is being channeled into
West Coast closed circuit advertising?- $300,000.
- Make it 450.And send the mayor's wife
200 roses from me,and make sure we get a picture
of it for all the newspapers.Do you wanna run
the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?I think you could spend your money
better in Canadian publicity.By the way... I've got
a couple of friends up in Torontowho'd probably be able
to get you a good tax break.George, I like your friends.Hey, Champ...you oughta come look at this boy
you're gonna fight on TV.Looks like he means business.Yeah, I mean business, too.Shirley, we got
any more coffee out there?Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed.
I'll get you some right away.After the fight, I may just retire
and run for emperor.The arena's
the only program concession,and the gross rental of the arena
is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?Diana Lewis, in the meat house
with southpaw Rocky Balboa.And he called the reporters?Yeah, it threw
my whole training schedule off.Don't be mad at him.
He's just trying to help.Adrian, I ain't mad,
it's just that, uh,when a reporter's around,
I get out of joint'cause they take cheap shots,
and Paulie knows that.Paulie keeps askin' me
for a job all the time,but he don't know nothin'
about fightin'.Are you gonna say
anything to him?What's to say? I just don't know
what he wants from me.I don't want nothin' from you.I don't want nothin' from you.This ain't no charity case.Get outta my house.It's not just your house.You ain't no friend no more.- Get out of my house, I just says.
- Don't talk to him like that.Both of you get out of my house.Yo.It's cold outside, Paulie.I don't want you messin' her,and I don't raise you
to go with this scum bum!Come on! Wanna hit on me?
Come on!I'll break both your arms
so they don't work for ya!That's right! I'm not good enough
to meet with Gazzo...That's what I think of Gazzo!Now you're a big-shot fighter
on your way up,you don't even throw a crumb
to your friend Paulie!When I go
and get you meat every morning!You forgot that!
Then I even give you my sister, too!- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?A pig gives you the best?You're such a loser!
I don't get married because of you!You can't live by yourself!I put you two together!
And you... don't you forget it!You owe me!- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?!You're supposed
to be good to me.What do I owe you, Paulie?!
What do I owe ya?!I treat you good!I cook for you, I clean for you,
I pick up your dirty clothes!I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothin'!And you made me feel
like a loser!I'm not a loser!- You're busted!
- What?!You're not a virgin!You let him into your pants!
She's busted!I can't haul meat no more!You want a roommate?Absolutely.Okay, now, when you
walk into the ringwith the number one
heavyweight of the world,you'll be ready, won't ya?Why? Because I waited
for 50 years to make you ready.You'll be able to spit nails, kid.Like the guy says,
you're gonna eat lightningand you're gonna crap thunder.You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.- Yo, Mickey.
- Hey! How are ya?Oh, Rock. I want you to meet
our cutman here, Al Salvani.- Take a look at his eye.
- How're you doin'?- That's right.
- It ain't bad. I seen worse.You ain't so bad yourself.- Cover up. Things'll be okay.
- Cover up? You cover up.Go and take a shower, will ya?Okay, Mick.
I'll see ya tomorrow.You covered that Whitmar fight,
didn't you?That's why you wanted me.Listen, we got a winner here!
We got a chance!He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.You just stand by, boy.
We're gonna win.Hey, Rock,
It's okay I talk to ya?Okay you talk to me?Sure.I figured some angle
to make some money off your name.My name?- How's that?
- Advertisin'. I know about that stuff.What do you know
about advertisin'? Huh?Hey, you can make money
off my name, make it, okay?I'm gonna take a shower.- Wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.Trying hard nowIt's so hard nowTrying hard nowYou're gonna kill him!Getting strong nowWon't be long nowGetting strong nowGonna fly nowFlying high nowGonna flyFlyFlyRocky.
What brings you here tonight?Mr. Jergens,
the poster's wrong.What do you mean?Well, I'm wearin' white pants
with a red stripe.It doesn't really matter,
does it?I'm sure you're gonna give us
a great show.Try to get some rest, kid.Good night.I can't do it.What?I can't beat him.Apollo?Yeah.I've been out there
walkin' around, thinkin'.I mean, who am I kiddin'?
I ain't even in the guy's league.What are we gonna do?I don't know.You worked so hard.It don't matter,
'cause I was nobody before.Don't say that.Oh, come on, Adrian.
It's true.I was nobody.But it don't matter either,
you know?So, I was thinkin'...It really don't matter
if I lose this fight.It really don't matter
if this guy opens my head, either.'Cause all I wanna do
is go the distance.Nobody's ever
gone the distance with Creed.And if I can go that distance......see, if that bell rings
and I'm still standin'......I'm gonna know
for the first time in my life, you see......that I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood.Time, kid.
Let's go.I'll wait for you here.Or how 'bout I wait here
and you fight, huh?You're lookin' very great today...
you know that?I gotta go now, but, uh,
don't you leave town, huh?Wish me luck.
I'm gonna need it.Good luck.Say, Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, huh?Good luck.Don't leave town.<i>I'd like to have you meet my colleague
workin' the fight with me... Stu Hansen.</i>Thank you, Bill Baldwin.The electricity is all over
the place tonight as Rocky Balboa...Hey, what the hell is that?I trained you to be a fighter,
not a billboard.- I'm doin' it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?Paulie gets three grand,
I get the robe.Shrewd.The story about tonight's fight,
their difference in style,you can quote a recent
sports magazine which said,""Could be the caveman
against the cavalier. ""I noticed a buzzing
in the background now, Bill.<i>Could be the challengers
getting ready to get into the ring.</i>Rocky! Look at my date.
Cost me $200.- 250.
- I gotta go. I gotta work.- How's the robe?
- It's a little baggy.<i>A 50 to 1 underdog
living a Cinderella story,</i><i>and he's captured people's
imaginations all over the world.</i>We love you, Rocky!- Good luck, champ.
- Hey, thanks for showin' up.<i>And his record... 44 victories.</i><i>He's got 38 by knockout,

to be George Washington?</i><i>Obviously so. He's got the hat on,
the whole thing. Look at that.</i><i>It's been confirmed.</i><i>The world champion Apollo Creed</i><i>is doing an imitation
of George Washington.</i><i>- He's throwing money.
- I don't believe it.</i><i>Remember we were talking about

You.- Is he talkin' to me?

and come out fightin'.Put your hands up there, chump.- Come out fightin'.
- Come on. Come on.<i>Rocky's takin' it carefully.</i><i>He's just going over and being calm,
it looks like from here.</i><i>There goes the big hat.</i><i>I've never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair.</i><i>And there's the bell
for round one.</i><i>The fighters come into the center
of the ring, looking at each other.</i><i>Rocky just looking.</i><i>The Champion gives one
of the left-handed jabs right there.</i><i>The Champ's stinging,
the slower challenger jabs at will.</i><i>In fact, it just looks like Rocky's
blocking the blows with his face.</i><i>The Champion doesn't look
the best he's ever been,</i><i>but he's really moving now.</i><i>Well, the Champion
is smiling now.</i><i>He's toying with this man.</i>Trying to give the fans
their money's worth.<i>He's very clearly outdoing
the challenger right now.</i>I'll get you. Come on.<i>He's just trying to make this man
make him... see! Make him miss like that.</i><i>Oh, the Champ
is just taunting him now.</i><i>He's dancing around.</i><i>I don't believe it!</i><i>- The Champ is down.
- Yes, he is!</i><i>Creed is down!
What a surprise this is!</i><i>This is the first time the Champion
has ever been knocked down.</i>Six... seven... eight.<i>Appears to be all right.
A little glassy-eyed, but okay.</i>Let's go to work right now, Rock!
Come on!<i>Now Rocky coming back out,
and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i><i>He really wants it.</i><i>Boy, the Champion's
coming back.</i><i>He's coming off the floor now,
and he's trying...</i><i>A left, a right, another left,
another right, combination!</i><i>Into the face!
And that's the Apollo we know.</i><i>Now he's taunting him.</i><i>He's taunting Rocky.
""Come on, let's go. ""</i><i>Left. There's another left.</i><i>Another left.</i><i>There!</i><i>Left and right.
Rocky's got him on the rope!</i>Come on.Okay, break.Punch. Hit me. Hit me.<i>I tell you, there's no way we expected
this kind of hitting from him.</i><i>Oh, no way,
but with the ability of the Champion...</i><i>Apollo unloading a left, really
trying to get him up against the ropes.</i><i>They're leading him over to his corner.
Rocky can hardly find his way.</i><i>He's sitting down now.</i>I told ya! I told ya!Your nose is broke.- How's it look?
- Ah, it's an improvement.I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.
I want you to stick and move.Go for the ribs.
Don't let that bastard breathe.The guy's great.He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.Finish this bum and let's go home.Stay to the body. The body!
You're doing great!<i>Creed got knocked down
at the end of the first.</i><i>He came back strong at the end
of the first, but he's working hard.</i><i>A smart left.
Another left and a right.</i><i>And now coming
into the corner again.</i><i>Oh, Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.</i>Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?Stop clownin' around here
and give these people something to see.<i>He says he wants him!</i><i>If you folks aren't aware... you're
watching a battle... I tell you that.</i><i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i><i>Oh! He tagged the Champ
with a tremendous hook!</i><i>The Champion is trying
to get himself out of there,</i><i>but he just can't do it.</i><i>He is being barraged with lefts
and rights to the head, to the body.</i><i>Balboa is smacking the Champion
right on the kisser.</i><i>And the referee's... they're ready
to keep going. Look at that!</i>- Back to your corner.
- Put that chump back in his corner.<i>- Come on, Creed.
- Balboa doesn't want to quit. Hey.</i><i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i><i>Now he's got him. A left.</i><i>A hard left
and a right combination.</i><i>What is keeping him up, Bill?
I don't know.</i><i>He can't even get his gloves up
to protect himself.</i><i>He needs to stop, Bill.</i>Down! Down!
Stay down!<i>Apollo dancing around
with his arms in the air.</i>...five... six...seven... eight... nine...<i>Apollo can't believe it.</i><i>The Champion got a left
to the ribs... his right rib.</i><i>Oh, this has been
a tremendous...</i>- Okay, Champ?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.It hurts, though.
He broke my rib.I can't see nothin'.
You gotta open my eye.- Cut me, Mick.
- I don't wanna do it!Go on, cut me.
Cut me.Try it.Oh, God.You're bleeding inside, Champ.
I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.
You ain't stoppin' nothin'.- You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.
- All right.- Go if you wanna go.
- I'm goin'.You gotta go.
You gotta give it all. Give it all!You gotta get him.
You gotta work on that body.<i>The crowd is on fire.
The 15th and final round.</i><i>They look like they've been
in a war... these two.</i><i>Oh, the Champion
really tagged him!</i><i>And Apollo clearly protecting
his right side... his ribs.</i><i>Hard left and right!</i><i>- Look at the blood coming from his face.
- Oh, he's spitting up blood now.</i><i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>Go for it! Go for it, Rock!<i>Listen to this crowd!</i><i>Oh! Another to the rib.
That left hand again right to the chin!</i><i>Oh! He's got him
up against the ropes!</i><i>Apollo the Champ.</i>Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Ain't gonna be no rematch.Don't want one.Rocky, you went the 15 rounds.
How do you feel?I feel all right.What were you thinking about
when that buzzer sounded?Adrian!What? Adrian!Rocky?Rocky?<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please...</i>Rocky?Rocky!<i>You've had the privilege
of witnessing the greatest exhibition</i><i>of guts and stamina
in the history of the ring.</i>Adrian!Rocky!<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i><i>we have a split decision.</i>Adrian!Rocky!<i>...for Creed.</i>- No plans out there for a rematch?
- Ain't gonna be a rematch.Oh, come on.
I don't know yet, okay?You heard him, ladies and...Rocko! That's my friend. Rocko!- Hey, you're breakin' the jacket.
- Let's go, Buddy. Come on.Paulie?- Adrian? Adrian!
- Rocky!Adrian!
Hey, where's your hat?I love you.- I love you!
- I love you.I love you.I love you.<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.moviesubtitles.org</font>"

Forgive your assassin!Forgive me,Mozart!Signore Salieri, open the door,be good now!""Signore"",we have something special for you.Something you're going to love.Is that good!""Signore"",believe me......this is the most delicious thing I ever ate in my life!Really,you don't know what you're miss...All right,that's enough! Open the door.""Signore"",if you don't open this door......we're gonna leave nothing for you.And I'm never gonna come see you again!Good morning,Father.Herr Salieri?Leave me alone.I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.Do you know who I am?That makes no difference.All men are equal in God's eyes.Are they?Offer me your confession.I can offer you God's forgiveness.How well are you trained in music?I know a little. I studied it in my youth.- Where? - Here in Vienna.Then you must know this.I can't say that I do.What is it?It was a very popular tune in its day.I wrote it.Here,how about this?This one brought down the house when we played it.Well?I regret it is not too familiar.Can you recall no melody of mine?I was the most famous composer in Europe.I wrote 40 operas alone.Here!What about this one?Yes,I know that!That's charming!I'm sorry,I didn't know you wrote that.I didn't.That was Mozart.Wolfgang......Amadeus Mozart.The man you accuse yourself of killing.You've heard that?Is it true?For God's sake,my son......if you have something to confess, do it now.Give yourself some peace.He......was my idol.Mozart.I can't think of a time when I didn't know his name.I was playing games...... when he was playing music for kings and emperors.Even the pope in Rome.I admit,I was jealous...... when I heard the tales they told about him.Not of the brilliant little prodigy...... but of his father, who had taught him everything.My father,he did not care for music.When I told him......how I wished I could be like Mozart...... he would say,""Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?You'd like me to drag you around, doing tricks like a circus freak?""How could I tell him......what music meant to me?While my father prayed earnestly to God...... to protect commerce...... I would offer up...... secretly...... the proudest prayer a boy could think of.""Lord,make me a great composer.""""Let me celebrate your glory through music...... and be celebrated myself.""""Make me famous through the world.""""Make me immortal.""""After I die......let people speak my name with love for what I wrote.""""In return......I will give you my chastity......my industry......my deepest humility, every hour of my life.""""Amen.""And do you know what happened?A miracle!My life changed forever.I knew God had arranged it all. That was obvious.One minute I was a frustrated boy......in an obscure little town. The next I was here......in Vienna,city of musicians...... and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.In a few years,I was his court composer. Isn't that incredible?Every night I sat with the emperor of Austria...... playing duets with him...... correcting the royal sight-reading.Actually,the man had no ear at all.But what did it matter?He adored my music.Tell me...If you had been me......wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow?And believe me,I honored it.I was a model of virtue.I kept my hands off women.I worked hours every day teaching students,many for free!Sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians.Work,that was all my life.And it was wonderful.Everybody liked me.I liked myself.Until he came.He came to Vienna to play some of his music......at the residence of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.Eagerly,I went there to seek him out.That night...... changed my life.As I wandered through the salon...... I played a little game with myself.This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4...... his first symphony at 7, a full-scale opera at 12!Did it show?Is talent like that...... written on the face?Which one of them...... could he be?Mozart is not here.- Stop it! - I am.- Stop it! - I am stopping it.I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.There. You see? I've stopped.- Now we're going back. - No!Yes! You don't know where you are.Here,everything goes backwards.People walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards.- That's stupid. - Why? People fart backwards.Ssa-ym-ssik!Ssa-ym-ssik!Yes,you are. You are very sick.No! Say it backwards,shitwit!Ssa-ym-ssik.Ssik,kiss.Ym,my. Ssa.Kiss my ass.Em-yrram!- I'm not playing! - Say it,it's serious.It's very serious.Yrram.Marry me.I'm not gonna marry you. You're a fiend.Uoy-evol-I-tub.Tub.But I......love...But I love you?- Tihs-ym-tae. - What?- Eat. - Eat.- Ym,my. - My.Tihs. Eat my shit.You filthy fiend!You filthy...!My music.They've started without me.That was Mozart!That giggling,dirty creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor.- I think that went well,don't you? - Indeed.The Viennese know good music, don't you think?Certainly.Your Grace.Ah,Mozart.- Why? - Why what,sir?Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests......by one of my own servants?The more license I allow you, the more you take.If His Grace is not satisfied, he can dismiss me.I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg.- Your father is waiting for you there. - No,Your Grace!I would prefer you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service......and learn your place.On the page it looked...Nothing!The beginning simple,almost comic.Just a pulse.Bassoons,basset horns......like a rusty squeezebox.And then,suddenly......high above it......an oboe.A single note,hanging there, unwavering.Until......a clarinet took it over......sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.This was no composition by a performing monkey.This was a music I had never heard.Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.It seemed to me I was hearing the voice of God.Excuse me.But why?Why would God choose an obscene child to be his instrument?It was not to be believed.This piece had to be an accident. It had to be.It better be.How good is he,this Mozart?He's remarkable,Majesty. I heard an extraordinary opera of his last month.-Idomeneo,King of Crete.  - That?A tiresome piece. I heard it too.Tiresome?A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.Too much spice.Too many notes.Majesty......it was the most promising work I've heard in years.Then,we should make some effort to acquire him.We could use a good German composer in Vienna,surely?I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say......an opera in German for our National Theater.Excellent,sire!But not German. I beg,Your Majesty.Italian is the proper language for opera.All educated people agree on that.What do you think,chamberlain?In my opinion,it's time we had a piece in our own language.Plain German for plain people.Kapellmeister?Majesty......I must agree with ""Herr Direttore"".German is......too brute for singing.Court composer......what do you think?I think it's an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna.It should infuriate the archbishop......if that is Your Majesty's intention.You are ""cattivo"",court composer.I want to meet this young man. Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.Well,there it is!This is a beautiful wig for you.It looks so marvelous and I love it.The other one.Here is the other one. I think you will love it.Here's the third one. So? Here we go.- How do you like it? - They're all so beautiful!Why don't I have three heads?This is funny!Three heads!Gentlemen.- Good morning. - Morning,Your Majesty.What do you have for me today?- Your Majesty,""Herr Mozart"". - Yes,what about him?He's here.Well,there it is. Good!I hope you won't find it improper, but I've written a march in his honor.What a charming idea,court composer. May I see?Just a...Just a trifle,of course.May I try it?Let's have some fun.Delightful,court composer!May I play it when he comes in?- You do me too much honor. - Bring in ""Herr Mozart"".But slowly.I need a minute to practice.Good,continue.G,Majesty.Excellent!Good,Majesty.Continue. Very good.Very good,Majesty.Tempo! Up.Lightly,then strongly! It's a march,Majesty.Again.Bravo,Majesty!Gentlemen,please. A little less enthusiasm,I beg you.No,please. It's not a holy relic.You know,we have met before. In this very room.You don't recall. You were only 6. He was giving a delightful concert!As he got off the stool,he fell.My sister Antoinette helped him up. Know what he did?He jumped into her arms and said, ""Will you marry me? Yes or no?""You know all these gentlemen. The Baron Van Swieten.- I'm a great admirer of yours. - Thank you.Kapellmeister Bonno.My pleasure.The Director of Opera, Count Orsini-Rosenberg.Sir,yes. The honor is mine, absolutely!Here is our illustrious court composer......Maestro Salieri.At last,such immense joy!I know your work well.You know,I composed some variations on a melody of yours.- Really? Which one? - ""Mio Caro Adone.""I'm flattered.A funny tune, but it yielded good things.And now he has returned the compliment.""Herr Salieri"" composed this little march for you.Really?Well,there it is.Down to business. We're going to commission an opera from you.What do you say?Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?Sire,if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.Did we?I don't think it was really decided, Your Majesty.- German. Please let it be German. - Why so?Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto.Have I seen it?I don't think you have,""Herr Direktor"". It's quite new.- I'll show it to you immediately. - I think you'd better.Well......tell us about it. Tell us the story.Well,it's quite amusing,Majesty.It's set... The whole thing is set in a...Yes? Where?In a harem,Majesty. In a seraglio.- You mean in Turkey? - Yes,exactly.Then why especially does it have to be in German?It doesn't,especially. It could be in Turkish if you really want.No,my dear fellow,the language is not finally the point.Do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?Why not? It's charming.I mean,I won't actually show concubines exposing their...It's not indecent. It's highly moral,Majesty.It's full of proper German virtues.Excuse me,Majesty,but what do you think these could be?Being a foreigner,I'd love to learn.Well,tell him,Mozart.Name us a German virtue.- Love,sire. - Oh,love!Of course,in Italy we know nothing about love.No,I don't think you do.Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching......stupid,fat couples rolling their eyes about. That's not love. It's rubbish!Majesty,you choose the language.I'll set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.Well,there it is. Let it be German.This is yours.Keep it. It's already here in my head.What? On one hearing only?I think so,sire. Yes.Show us.The rest is just the same,isn't it?That doesn't really work,does it?Did you try...?Shouldn't it be a bit more...?Or this?This. Yes.Better? What do you think?Grazie,Signore.All I ever wanted was to sing to God.He gave me that longing......and then made me mute. Why?Tell me that.If he didn't want me to praise him with music......why implant the desire......like a lust in my body?And then deny me the talent?Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson,sir.Maestro.Well...?How do you like it?It's Turkish.My hairdresser said everything this year's going to be Turkish.Does he?What else did he tell you today?Come,come! Give me some gossip.Well,I heard you met ""Herr Mozart"".News travels fast in Vienna.And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?- Yes. - Is there a part in it for me?- No. - How do you know?- Do you know where it's set,my dear? - Where?In a harem.- What's that? - A brothel.Come.Let's begin.- What does he look like? - Mozart?- You might be disappointed. - Why?Looks and talent don't always go together,Katerina.Looks don't concern me,maestro.Only talent interests a woman of taste.Shall we continue?There she was.I don't know where they met or how.  There she stood!On stage,for all to see.Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.Ten minutes of ghastly scales. Arpeggios!Whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.Understand,I was in love with the girl.Or at least in lust.And I swear to you, I never laid a finger on her.All the same,I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.Least of all,""the creature"".Brava,madame! You are an ornament to our stage.Your Majesty.Well,""Herr Mozart"". A good effort.Well,decidedly that.An excellent effort! You have shown us something......quite new tonight. - It is new.- It is,isn't it,sire? - Yes,indeed.So then,you liked it? You really liked it,sire?Well,of course I did! It's very good!Of course,now and then, just now and then......it seemed a touch...What do you mean,sire?Well,I mean,occasionally, it seems to have...How shall one say...?How shall one say,""direktor""?- Too many notes,Majesty? - Exactly. Very well put.- Too many notes. - I don't understand.There are just as many notes as I required,neither more nor less.My dear fellow,there are in fact......only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I,court composer?Yes. On the whole,yes,Majesty.This is absurd!Young man,don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious.It's quality work.And there are simply too many notes. Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.Which few did you have in mind?Wolfgang!Wolfgang,my dear!- Wolfgang! - Majesty,this is ""Frau Weber"".She's my landlady.- Enchanted,madame. - Sire,such an honor!This is my dear daughter,Constanze.- She's the fiancée of ""Herr Mozart"". - Really?How charming. Please.Well......when do you marry?We haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.Not entirely. Not altogether.- Excuse me,but how old are you? - 26.My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady......and stay with us in Vienna. - You see?I told him that, but he won't listen to me.Your Majesty, you give such wonderful......such royal advice. May I...?Well,there it is.Wolfie,will you get some water?Will you get some water,please?Wolfie,get some water!Excuse me. Excuse me.Did you know?- What? - The marriage.What does it matter to you?Nothing. He can marry who he pleases, I don't give a damn.How was I?You were sublime.And what did you think of the music?Extremely clever.Katerina,I...Excuse me.Is that woman still lying on the floor?- No,she's fine. - Oh,I'm so relieved.Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.- Did you like it then? - How could I not?It's the best music in Vienna today,don't you agree?She must be dazzling in bed.I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.No other reason why you'd marry someone like that.Come in.Excuse me. Wolfie,Mom isn't feeling very well.- Can we go home? - Yes.No,no,no. You can't take him away now.This is his night.Won't you introduce us,Wolfgang?Excuse us,""Fräulein"". Good night,""signore"".At that moment I knew, beyond any doubt...... he'd had her.The creature had had my darling girl.It was incomprehensible!What was God up to?Was it possible I was being tested?Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness......in the face of every offense?No matter how painful?It's very possible.But why him?Why choose Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?My heart was filling up......with such hatred for that little man.For the first time in my life, I began to know......really......violent thoughts.Every day,sometimes for hours, I would pray.Lord......please......send him away......back to Salzburg.For his sake......as well as mine.- No! I won't have him back. - But,Your Grace...Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled,conceited brat!Yes,sir......that is the truth.But don't blame him. The fault is mine,entirely.I was too indulgent with him.Please,Your Grace?Give him one more chance?You have leave to try.God bless,Your Grace! I thank Your Grace.I thank you!I write to you with urgent news.  I'm coming to Vienna.Take no further steps towards marriage until we meet.As you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours...... do as I bid,and await my coming.I now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony.Those whom God hath joined together......let no man put asunder.Beloved father:You say Vienna is the musicians' city.  To conquer here is to conquer Europe.With my wife I can do it.  One day,when I'm wealthy...... you'll live with us, and we'll be so happy.Good morning. This is my niece,Princess Elizabeth.Your Highness.She's asked me to recommend a music instructor.- I've come up with an excellent idea. - Your Majesty!It would be such a tremendous honor!I was thinking of ""Herr Mozart"". What is your view?It's an interesting idea, Majesty,but...Yes?My concern is to protect you......from any hint of favoritism.Favoritism.- What is this? - What is what?Why must I submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?Because His Majesty wishes it.Is the emperor angry with me?- Quite the contrary. - Then why not appoint me to the post?You are not the only composer in Vienna.No. But I'm the best.Mozart.A little modesty might suit you better.Who is on this committee?Kapellmeister Bonno,Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.Naturally,the Italians! Of course,always the Italians!They're all musical idiots!- And you want them to judge my music? - Young man......the issue is quite simple. If you want this position......you must submit your stuff, along with all your colleagues.Must I?Well,I won't.How are we supposed to live?Do you want me to beg on the streets?Don't be stupid.- All they want to see is your work. - Shit.- What's wrong with that? - Shut up! Just shut up.One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.They'll come anyway.- No,they won't. - They love me here.- I know how things work in this city. - You know everything,don't you?- Yes? - Excuse me,sir.- A lady insists on talking to you. - Who?She didn't say, but she says it's urgent.Excuse me,my dear.Your Excellency.How can I help you?- Frau Mozart? - I've come on behalf of my husband.I brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment.How charming, but why did he not come himself?Well,he's terribly busy,sir.I understand.I will look at them the moment I can.It will be an honor. Please give him my warmest regards.Would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?- While I wait. - I'm afraid I'm not at leisure......this precise moment.Leave them with me. I assure you,they will be safe.I really cannot do that,sir.You see,he doesn't know I'm here.Then he didn't send you?No,sir. This was my own idea.- I see. - Sir,we're desperate.We really need this job.My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.I don't mean that he's lazy,because he works all day long.It's just that he's not practical.Money simply slips through his fingers. It's ridiculous.Let me offer you some refreshment.Do you know what these are?""Capezzoli di Venere""! Nipples of Venus.They're Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. Try one. Go on,try one!They're quite surprising.They're wonderful!Thank you very much,Your Excellency.Don't keep calling me that.Keeps me at such a distance.I wasn't born a court composer,you know.I'm from a small town.Just like your husband.Are you sure you can't......leave this and come back again?It's very tempting,sir.But it's impossible,I'm afraid.He'd be frantic if he knew they were missing.You see,they're all originals.- Originals? - Yes,sir. He doesn't make copies.These......are originals?Astounding!It was actually... It was beyond belief.These were first and only...... drafts of music.But they showed no corrections of any kind. Not one.He had simply written down music......already finished in his head.Page after page of it. As if he were just taking dictation.And music......finished as no music is ever finished.Displace one note......and there would be diminishment.Displace one phrase,and the structure would fall.It was clear to me...... that sound I had heard in the archbishop's palace...... had been no accident.Here again was the very voice of God.I was staring through the cage......of those meticulous ink strokes......at an absolute beauty.Is it not good?It is miraculous.Yes,he's very proud of his work.So you will help us?I dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.One word from me and the post is his.Thank you,Your Excellency! Thank you!Come back tonight.- Tonight? - Alone.What for?Some service deserves service in return.No?- What do you mean? - Isn't it obvious?It's a post all Vienna seeks.If you wish it for your husband,come tonight.I'm a married woman,sir.Then don't.It's up to you.And not to be vague,that is the price.There is no God of mercy,Father.Just a God of torture.Evening came.I sat there,not knowing whether she would return or not.I prayed as I had never prayed before.Dear God...... enter me now.Fill me with one piece of true music.One piece with your breath in it,so I know that you love me.Show me one sign of your favor,and I will show mine to Mozart.I will get him the royal position.Enter me.Please.Please!Yes?That lady is back,sir.Show her in.Well?I'm here.My husband has gone to a concert.He didn't think I would enjoy it.Well,where shall we go?Should we stay here?Well...Do you still want to look at these?Or don't we need to bother anymore?Suppose we don't,really.Show this woman out.Stanzi.Stanzi.What is it?What's the matter? Tell me.Tell me.I love you.I love you.From now on,we are enemies.You and I.Because you choose for your instrument...... a boastful,lustful,smutty,infantile boy...... and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation.Because you are unjust...... unfair...... unkind...... I will block you.I swear it.I will hinder and harm your creature on earth...... as far as I am able.I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.Of course not.I have to tell you.Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.Really?One of my own pupils,a very young singer......Maria Theresa Paradis......told me she was...Well...Well,what?Molested,Majesty.Twice,in the course of the same lesson.There is a ""Herr Mozart"" waiting for you in the salon.- Whom did they choose? - Herr Zummer.Herr Zummer?But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.No,no. He has yet to achieve mediocrity.I can't lose this post. I simply can't.Excellency,please.Let's go to the palace. You can talk to the emperor......and tell him that ""Herr Zummer"" is an awful choice.He could do musical harm to the princess.Between us,no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess.Look......I must have pupils.Without pupils,I can't manage.You don't mean you're living in poverty?No,but I'm broke.Well,how is this possible?I hear your concerts are quite successful.They're stupendously successful.You can't get a seat. But no one will hire me.They want to hear me play......but they won't let me teach their daughters,as if I was a fiend.Seriously......is there any chance you could manage a loan?Only for six months. Eight,at the most.You expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?As a matter of fact,I do.I am working on something that will explode like a bomb all over Europe.I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything.You name the terms.Well,how exciting.Tell me more.- It's a bit of a secret. - Come,come. I'm interested.This is delicious. What is it?It's cream cheese mixed with sugar......suffused with rum. Crema Mascarpone Speciale.Italian.Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.Two thou...Two hundred florins. That's all I need.A hundred.Fifty.What exactly are you working on?Really,I can't say.I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor,Mozart.However......I know a distinguished gentleman I can recommend,and......he has a daughter.Quiet! Quiet!Herr Mozart.Welcome. Pay no attention,they're impossible.I treat them just like my own children.Which of them do you wish me to teach?That's funny.You're a funny fellow.This is the instrument. I hope it's to your satisfaction.Of course it'll be to his satisfaction.Come,we're going to listen to some music. Come!Good boy.Now.Please play me something,just to give me an idea.Anything will do.Just go ahead.Just as if we weren't here.Part of music,getting used to an audience. Right,""Herr Mozart""?Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.We're both a little shy.Play.- I said play! - Michael,please.Perhaps if I play first,it might encourage the ""Fräulein"".Why don't you let me try?Stop it! Stop! He always howls when he hears music.We've got to break him of that habit.We've got to break them of their habit!Play. Please.""Herr Mozart"",play. Please,I beg you.That's it. That's it.Keep playing!Keep playing! That's it!Mozart,that's wonderful! Wonderful!Next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs,let me know.Goodbye,""Fräulein"". Goodbye,madam. Goodbye,sir.Papa?Papa!Why are you here?Am I not welcome?Of course,welcome. Papa,welcome! Welcome!You're very thin. Doesn't your wife feed you?Of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day!- Is she not here? - No,she had to help her mother.She's like that.Her mother's a very sweet woman,you'll...I didn't know you were home.Stanzi,this is my father.We'll wait. We'll wait.Why don't you get up now,my darling?She's very tired,poor creature. You know me. I'm such a pig.It's not easy cleaning up after me.Don't you have a maid?Oh. No. We could if we wanted......but Stanzi insists on doing everything herself.How is your......financial situation?Couldn't be better.That's not what I hear.What do you mean? It's wonderful.Really,it's marvelous! People love me here.They say you have debts.Who?Who says that?That's a malicious lie!Do you have pupils?I don't want pupils!They get in the way.I have to have time for composition.Composition doesn't pay. You know that.That one will.What's that?It's a secret.Secret? You don't have secrets from me.No! Please! I don't want you to see it. I don't want anyone to see it.You'll be so proud of me.It'll be the best thing I've ever done. The best thing anyone...There she is!Look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Now,Papa,confess it.- Could you want a prettier daughter? - Stop it,Wolfie!I look dreadful.Are you......expecting?- Yes,I am. - Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.- May I offer you some tea? - Who wants tea? Let's go out!This calls for a feast. You don't want tea,do you?I know! Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties,don't you?How can you be so boring? Tea!Come on,Papa. Hurry!Here we go. Good day.Now!I name the penalty! I name the penalty!And the penalty is...- Give her a good one! - Show us your legs!Come on,come on!It's just a game,Papa.Thank you.""Herr Mozart"",why don't you name your son's penalty?!Yes,Papa. Name it.Name it. I'll do anything you say. Anything.I want you to come back to Salzburg with me.The penalty must be performed in the room.I'm tired of this game.But my penalty! I've got to have a penalty!I name a penalty!The penalty is......you shall play our tune......in the manner of Johann Sebastian Bach!- Turn him over! - Over?!Now you play it backwards!- Another one! Give me another one! - Play it like Gluck!- Boring. Another! - Handel!I don't like him! Another one!Play Salieri.Now that is a challenge! That is a challenge.Please! Please!Go on. Mock me. Laugh!That was not Mozart laughing,Father.That was God.That was God laughing at me through that obscene giggle.Go on,""Signore"". Laugh.Show my mediocrity for all to see.One day I will laugh at you.Before I leave this earth......I will laugh at you.- Wolfie? - What?There's a young girl here to see you.What does she want?She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.Damn.Yes?- Are you ""Herr Mozart""? - That's right.My name is Lorl,sir. I'm a maidservant.I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.They'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain......anonymous.Is this your idea,Papa?Mine?- Are you playing a trick on me? - I've never seen this girl.- Is this some kind of joke? - Not at all,sir.Young woman,this won't do.My son can't accept such an offer,no matter how generous......unless he knows who's behind it. - I can't tell you that,sir.- This is ridiculous! - What is ridiculous?Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.People send us gifts all the time.You cannot accept her without references.Well,this is none of your business.- Whoever sent you is going to pay? - That's right.Splendid! Now we're going to let a stranger into our house.Who is we? Who is letting who...?- Could you please wait outside? - Yes,ma'am.Look,old man!We spend a fortune on you,and all you can do is criticize.- And now... - Stanzi!No! It's right that he should hear! I'm sick to death of it.We can't do anything right for you,can we?You won't have to do anything for me ever again.I'm leaving.- No,Papa. - I won't stay and be a burden.No one calls you that.She does. She says I sleep all day.And so you do!The only time you come out is to eat.Well,what do you expect?Do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?- So now I'm a bad housekeeper! - So you are. It's a pigsty.When can you start?- Right away,ma'am. - Good.They're out every night,sir.Thank you,sir.Do any pupils come to the house?Not that I've seen.Then how does he pay for all this?Does he work at all?Yes,sir. All day long. He never leaves the house till evening.He just sits there,writing and writing.Really?What is it he's writing?I wouldn't know that,sir.Of course not.You're a good girl.You're very kind to do this.The next time you're sure they'll be out of the house,let me know.Thank you,sir.I think I found out about the money,sir.Yes? What?He kept seven snuffboxes in here. I could swear they were all gold.And now look.There's only one left.Where does he work?In there,sir.Gentlemen,I've just heard some news......that may interest you. - What?Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.Italian?That's not all. He has chosen for his subject,Figaro.The Marriage of Figaro.He's setting that play to music?Yes.What is this ""Marriage of Figaro""?It's a French play,Kapellmeister.It has been banned by the emperor.You're absolutely sure?Herr Mozart.Gentlemen,sit down.Mozart.Are you aware that I have declared the French play ""Figaro""......unsuitable for our theater?Yes,sire.Yet we hear you're making an opera from it. Is this true?Who told you this,Majesty?It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?Yes,I...I admit it is.Would you tell me why?Majesty,it is only a comedy.What you think is scarcely the point.It's what His Majesty thinks that counts.But,Your Majesty...Mozart......I am a tolerant man.I do not censor things lightly. When I do,I have good reason.""Figaro"" is a bad play.It stirs up hatred between classes.In France,it has caused only bitterness.My sister Antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people.I swear,there's nothing like that in the piece.I've taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.I'm afraid you're rather innocent.In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our people......simply over a theater piece.Majesty,this is just a frolic. A piece about love.""Love"". Again!And it's new!It's entirely new. The people will go mad for it.I have scenes...The end of Act Il,for example.It starts as a duet. A husband and wife quarreling.Suddenly,the scheming maid comes in. It's a very funny situation.Duet turns into trio.Then the husband's valet comes in.Trio turns into quartet.Then a gardener. Quartet becomes quintet.And so on,on and on.Sextet,septet,octet.How long do you think I can sustain that?I have no idea.Guess.Guess,Your Majesty.Imagine the longest time it could be sustained,then double it.Well...Six......seven minutes?- Eight minutes? - Twenty,sire. Twenty minutes!Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives!Sire,only opera can do this.In a play,if more than one person speaks at once......it's just noise.But with opera,with music......you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time.It's not noise. It's a perfect harmony!Mozart,music is not the issue here.No one doubts your talent. It's your literary judgment that's in question.Even with the politics taken out,it would still remain a vulgar farce.Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?Surely you can choose more elevated themes.Elevated! What does that mean,elevated?I am fed to the teeth with these......elevated things. Old dead legends.Why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?Because they do.They go on forever.At least what they represent: the eternal in us.Opera is here to ennoble us,Mozart.You and me,just the same as His Majesty.""Bello,bello,bello."" Come on now,be honest!You'd rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules,Horatius or Orpheus.People so lofty,they sound as if they shit marble!What!Govern your tongue,Mozart! How dare you!Forgive me,Majesty.I'm a vulgar man......but I assure you,my music is not.You are passionate,Mozart......but you do not persuade.Sire,the whole opera is finished.Do you know how much work went into it?His Majesty has been more than patient,""Signore"".How can I persuade if I can't show it?That will do,""Herr Mozart"".Just let me tell you how it begins.May I just do that,Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?Please.Look...There's a servant on his knees. Do you know why?Not from oppression. He's measuring a space.Do you know what for?His bed. His wedding bed.To see if it will fit!Late.Late!On the beat.Good!Yes!Early!Well,Mozart is already rehearsing.In that case,gentlemen,I think...I think we should help Mozart all we can.And protect him against the emperor's anger.What anger?About the ballet.What ballet?Excuse me......but didn't His Majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?- Herr Mozart! - Yes?- A word with you. - Certainly,""Herr Direktor"".Now,""Herr Mozart""!Five minutes,please.Five minutes!Yes?Do you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?- It's not a ballet,it's a dance. - Exactly. A dance.Surely,His Majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story.It's dangerous to interpret his edicts. Give me your score,please.Thank you.What are you doing,""Herr Direktor""?Taking out what you should never have put in.Please. Please!I have no one else to turn to.- What is it? - It's unbelievable.The ""direktor"" has torn up a huge section of my music.They say I have to rewrite the opera.But it's perfect as it is.I can't......rewrite what's perfect.Please.Can't you talk to him?Please.Why bother? He's no friend of yours.I could kill him! I mean,really! Kill him!I threw the entire score into the fire,he made me so angry.- You burned the score? - No,my wife took it out in time.Thank God.It's unfair that a man like that should have power over our work!But there are those who have power over him.I think I'll take this up with the emperor.Excellency......would you?With all my heart,Mozart.Thank you.Please,""Herr Mozart"". ""Please,it's not a holy relic.""I don't need to tell you I said nothing,whatever,to the emperor.I went to the theater to tell Mozart something,anything...... when suddenly,in the middle of the third act...... to my astonishment,the emperor...... who never attended rehearsals,suddenly appeared.What is this?I don't understand.Is it modern?Majesty......the ""Herr Direktor""......he has removed ""un balletto""......that would have occurred at this place.Why?It is your regulation,sire.No ballet in your opera.Salieri.Do you like this?It's not a question of liking,Majesty.Your own law decrees it,I'm afraid.Well,look at them!No! This is nonsense!- Let me see the scene with the music. - But,sire!Oblige me!Yes,Majesty.Can we see the scene with the music,please?Certainly! Certainly,""Herr Direktor""!Bring the palace set back in,please.The restored third act......was bold,brilliant.The fourth......was astounding.I saw a woman...... disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first...... tender words he has offered her in years.Simply because he thinks she is someone else.I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater...... conferring on all who sat there,perfect absolution.God was singing through this little man...... to all the world.Unstoppable.Making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.And then,do you know what happened?A miracle!With that yawn...... I saw my defeat turn into a victory.Mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once.Three yawns......and the opera would fail the same night.Two yawns,within a week at most.With one yawn,the composer could still get...Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had! Withdrawn!I know,I know.It's outrageous.Still,if the public doesn't like one's work......one has to accept the fact gracefully.But what is it that they don't like?I can speak for the emperor.You make too many demands on the royal ear.The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour. You gave him four.What did you think of it yourself?Did you like it at all?I thought it was marvelous.Of course. It's the best opera yet written.I know it!Why didn't they come?I think you overestimate our dear Viennese,friend.You didn't give them a bang at the end of songs......to let them know when to clap.I know,I know.Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.I wouldn't presume.Nevertheless,at the risk of imposing......I'd like you to see my new piece.It would be an honor for me.No,the honor would be all mine.I believe...I believe......it is the best opera yet written,my friends.Salieri!You are the brightest star in the musical firmament.You do honor to Vienna and to me.""Herr Mozart""!- It was good of you to come. - How could I not?Bravo,maestro.Did my work please you?I never knew that music like that was possible.- You flatter me. - No.One hears such sounds......and what can one say but: Salieri!Everybody's here and we've got guests. Bravo! Well,I've got some more.You remember my good friend Schikaneder. Come in.Don't be shy.- This is a very nice girl,and this... - Wolfie?Yes,my love?- These gentlemen are from Salzburg. - Salzburg?We were just talking about Salzburg.Your father is dead.So rose the dreadful ghost......from his next and blackest opera.There on the stage,stood the figure of a dead commander.I knew......only I understood......that the horrifying apparition was Leopold......raised from the dead!Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father......to accuse his son before all the world!It was......terrifying and wonderful to watch.And now......the madness began in me.The madness of a man splitting in half.Through my influence,I saw to it...... ""Don Giovanni"" was played only five times in Vienna.But,in secret,I went to every one of those five.Worshiping sound I alone seemed to hear.And as I stood there,understanding how......that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son...... even from beyond the grave...... I began to see a way...... a terrible way......I could finally triumph......over God.""Herr Mozart""?I have come to commission work from you.- What work? - A Mass for the dead.What dead?Who is dead?A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.- Who are you? - I am only a messenger.Do you accept?You will be well paid.Do you accept?Work fast.And be sure tell no one what you do.You will see me again soon.Wolfie?My plan was so simple......that it terrified me.First,I must get the death Mass,and then......I must achieve his death.What?His funeral!Imagine it!The cathedral,all Vienna sitting there.His coffin. Mozart's little coffin in the middle.And then......in that silence......music.A divine music......bursts out over them all.A great Mass of death.Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.Composed by his devoted friend......Antonio Salieri.What sublimity!What depth!What passion in the music!Salieri has been touched by God at last......and God forced to listen!Powerless to stop it!I,for once,in the end,laughing at him!The only thing that worried me was the actual killing.How does one do that?How does one kill a man?It's one thing......to dream about it.Very different when you...When you have to do it......with your own hands.Come in!I've come to dinnerDinner! Are you mad? I'm a nobleman!I only ever dine with people of my own height!Stop it!Be careful Be carefulHold tightI'm a famous...... horsemanAnd we're a famous horsyGive me a hoof,my darlingAnd I'll give you my heartTake me to your stableAnd never more we'll partKill me Kill meWe're going to make a soprano stewWe're going to make a soprano stewAnd when you make a soprano stewShut up!I'm sick to death of that tune!Give me some hay,my darlingAnd I'll give you my heartLeporello! Some hay!We hope...... you're contentedWith what...... we've presentedAnd love our dove of peace- What did you think? - It was wonderful!- He liked the little people. - It's all in good fun.I liked the horse.I tell you,if you played ""Don Giovanni"" here......you would've had a wonderful success.You belong here.Not at the snobby court. You could do anything you like.The more fantastic,the better. That's what people want: fantasy.You write a proper part for me......a couple of catchy songs......I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!- What do you say? - How much will you pay him?Well! I see you brought your manager with you.Well,madame......how about half the receipts?Half the receipts!- Stanzi! - I'm talking about now.How much will you pay him now? Down payment.Down payment?Who do you think I am,the emperor?I have to go.Stay here,you'll enjoy this next one.You won't do this.- Why not? Half the house! - When?We need money now! He pays you now,or you don't do it.I don't trust that man.I don't like what he did with your opera. It was common.You liked it. Monkey,punky,flunky!Half the house.You'll never see a penny. I want it here in my hand.- I'll put it here in your hand. - Shut up!You won't put a thing in my hand until I see some money!It's embarrassing. Can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause,baron.He has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of Vienna.He never pays his debts.I can't think of anyone to whom I'd dare recommend him.""Herr Mozart"". What a surprise!What can I do for you?Is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music?Your pupil is married and living in Mannheim,young man.Really?Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction.What is it,Mozart?What's the matter with you?Well......since it appears no one is eager to hire my services......could you favor me with a little money instead?What for?If a man cannot earn,he must borrow.That's hardly the way to go about it.You are right,sir. You are right.But you see,I am endowed with talent,and you with money.If I offer mine......you should offer yours.I'm sorry,no.Please.My answer is no,Mozart.Please.Please!Don't answer it.Why?Tell him...Tell him I'm not here.Tell him...Tell him I'm working on it.Come back later.- Am I interrupting something? - No.Good. Where's our friend?He's not here.But he's working on it,he told me to tell you.Is that it?Is he happy with it?What's this? A Requiem Mass?- You think I'm in the funeral business? - Leave that alone!- Put it down! It's nothing for you! - I'm sorry.What have you got for me?Finished?- What? - The vaudeville,what do you think?Yes.- Can I see it? - No.Why not?Because there's nothing to see.Look......I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes.- Well,we can. - So let me see it. Where is it?Here.It's all right here in my noodle. The rest is just scribbling.Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling and scribbling.- Like a drink? - Look,you little cunt!Do you know how many people I've hired?- Leave him alone! - I'm paying them!- He's doing his best. - Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto!Only an idiot would ask him to work on that!Twelve-foot snakes,magic flutes?What's so intelligent about a Requiem?Money. Money.You're mad.She's mad.- Oh,yes? - Wolfie,write it down.Just write it down.On paper.It's no use to anybody in your head.To hell with your death Mass!Calm yourself. What's the matter with you?- I won't work there anymore. - What happened?You don't know what it's like.""Herr Mozart"" frightens me.He drinks all day......then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.Is he working?Oh,I am frightened,sir,really!- When he speaks,he makes no sense. - Is he working?I suppose so.He sits there all the time,doing some silly opera.- Opera? - Don't ask me to go back again.I'm frightened. I'm very,very frightened!Are you sure it's an opera?I don't have it yet.Are you neglecting my request?No. No,I...I promise you......I'll give you a wonderful piece,the best I ever...This is my wife,Stanzi.I've been sick,but I'm all right now,aren't I?Yes,sir. He's all right.And he's working on it very hard.Give me two more weeks. Please.The sooner you finish,the greater your reward.Work.Wolfie.I think you really are going mad.You slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny!And here,this is not a ghost!This is a real man,who puts down real money.Why on earth won't you finish it?Can you give me one reason I can understand?It's killing me.You're drunk,aren't you?Be honest,tell me. You've been drinking.It's not fair. I worry about you all the time.I do everything I can to help you.And all you do is drink and talk nonsense,and frighten me.Go back to bed!Please.Let me... Let me sit here.Let me stay here with you.I did it. And I was proud to do it.""Leave!"" I said. ""Right away. Take the child with you!""""Go to the spa and get your health back."" I was shocked.Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.I couldn't believe my eyes,poor little thing.You monster! No one exists but you,do they?You and your music. I warned her.""Choose a man,not a baby"",I said.""You marry him,you won't have a pot to piss in."" You selfish thing!Selfish,that's what you are. Simply selfish! Do you hear me?Pick him up.Pick him up!Be careful. Come with me.You,follow me.- Is it over? - Yes,it's over. It's over.Go!Go,go. Go.Go! Go!Where is your wife?Where is your wife?She's not well either. She went to the spa.You are so good to me.Truly. Thank you.Please!No,I mean to come to my opera.You. You are the only colleague of mine who came.Mozart.I would never miss anything you had written.- It's just a vaudeville. - No,no!It's a sublime piece.The grandest ""operone""!I tell you......you are the greatest composer known to me.Do you mean it?- It's him! - Who?The man.He's here.Tell him to go away.Tell him I'm still working on it. Don't let him in.No,no. Wait!Ask him if he would give me some money now.Tell him if he would,it will help me to finish it.- Salieri? - Yes.- Can we come in? - Better not. He's sleeping.- He's all right,though? - Yes,he's just exhausted.He became dizzy,that's all.- Well,tell him we came by,won't you? - Of course.Give him this. That's his share.- That should cheer him up. - Indeed!And now,good night to you all. It was......perfection,truly.Thank you.What happened?He said to give you this.And if you finish by tomorrow night......he will pay you another hundred ducats.Another...?That's too soon. Tomorrow night...It's impossible.- Did he say a hundred? - Yes.It's too soon.Can I...?Could I help you?Would you?Actually,you could.- I want to go. - Where?- I want to go back to Vienna. - Now?- Yes. - Why?I feel wrong.I feel wrong being here.- Where did I stop? - The end of the ""Recordare"".So now ""Confutatis""...How would you translate that?""Consigned to flames of woe.""- Do you believe in it? - What?A fire which never dies,burning you forever.Oh,yes.Possible.- Come,let's begin. - We ended in F major.- Yes. - So,now,A minor.- A minor. - Yes.""Confutatis"". A minor.Start with the voices.- Basses first. Second beat of the... - Time?Common time. Second beat of the first measure.On A.Second measure,second beat.You see?- Yes. G-sharp? - Of course.Second beat of the third measure,on E.Do you have me? Show me.Good. Good.Now the tenors.Fourth beat of the first measure,on C.Second measure,fourth beat. D.- All right? - Yes,continue.Second beat of the fourth measure,on F.Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,bass trombones,basses.Identical notes and rhythm.First bassoon,tenor trombones,with the tenors.- You go too fast. - Do you have it?- Bassoon to trombone what? - With the tenors.- Identical? - The instruments doubling the voices.Trumpets and timpani. Trumpets in D. Listen.- I don't understand! - Listen!Trumpets in D,tonic and dominant,first and third beats.It goes with the harmony!Yes. Yes,yes!I understand. And that's all?No,now for the real fire. Strings in unison.Ostinato,on A. Like this:Next measure is rising.Do you have it? Show me.- It's wonderful! - Yes,yes. Go on.- Write that down! - Yes,yes.""Call me among the blessed.""C major.Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C,sopranos above.Sopranos up to F on the second ""voca""?And on ""dictus"". And underneath,just violins. Arpeggios.Scale in eighth notes,then back to ostinato.- Do you have it? - You go too fast.- Do you have it? - One moment,please!Good. Show me the whole thing from the beginning.Do you want to rest a bit?No,I'm not tired at all.We'll stop for a moment.- Then we'll finish the ""Lacrimosa"". - I can keep going. I assure you.Will you stay with me while I sleep a little?I'm not leaving you.I'm so ashamed.Of what?I was foolish.I thought you did not care for my work,or me.Forgive me.Forgive me.What are you doing here?Your husband took sick.I brought him home.Why you?Because,madame,I was at hand.Well,thank you very much. You can go now.He needs me,ma'am.No,he doesn't.And I don't want you here. Just go,please.- He asked me to stay. - And I'm ask...I'm back.I missed you so much.If you'd just......show me that you need me.And I'll try to do better too.What is this?No,Wolfie,not this. Not this.You're not to work on this ever again.I've decided.This is not his handwriting.It's mine.I was assisting him.He's not to work on this anymore.- It's making him ill. - But...Good night.I regret we have no servants to show you out,""Herr Salieri"".Please respect my wish and go.Madame......I will respect his.Your merciful God.He destroyed his own beloved,rather than let a mediocrity......share in the smallest part of his glory.He killed Mozart.And kept me alive to torture.Thirty-two years of torture.Thirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct.My music......growing fainter.All the time fainter......till no one plays it at all.And his...Good morning,professor. Time for the water closet.Then we have your favorite breakfast. Sugar rolls. He loves those.Fresh sugar rolls.I will speak for you,Father.I speak for all mediocrities in the world.I am their champion.I am their patron saint.Mediocrities everywhere......I absolve you.I absolve you.I absolve you.I absolve you.I absolve you all."
The Departed|2006|91|Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg|Martin Scorsese|"<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i><i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i><i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i><i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.It put hate in your heart.<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i><i>True guineas.</i><i>They took over their piece of the city.</i><i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i><i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i><i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i><i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i><i>No one gives it to you.</i><i>You have to take it.</i>Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.Won't happen again, Mr. C.Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.You should be proud.You get your period yet, Carmen?You Johnny Sullivan's kid?- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?You do good in school?- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.They call that a paradox.Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.You know where I am on L Street?Good.- Good boy.
- Thanks.To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.A man makes his own way.No one gives it to you.You have to take it.- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.Guineas from the North End,
down Providence......tried to tell me what to do.And something maybe happened to them.Maybe like that:Jeez. She fell funny.Francis, you really should see somebody.<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.Today what I'm saying to you is this:When you're facing a loaded gun......what's the difference?<i>That's my boy.</i>Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile......as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...Sir, yes, sir!<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.Fuck you. Fucking queers.Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.Pencils.Begin.What are you looking at?Forget it.Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.They are.So she tells me, ""You never finish anything.
You finish the police course......you get taken care of again, baby.""
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.Fuck yourself.Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance......into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident......each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.Congratulations to all our new troopers.Thank you. You are dismissed.Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.School's out.Thank you, Frank.You earned it.No more pencils, no more books.All right.<i>This is not the regular police...</i><i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i><i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!<i>What's the difference?</i><i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i><i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...- ... to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.We won't be working together,
that is, directly.You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.You're a worker. You rise fast.Like a 12-year-old's dick.- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.You can go in there now.You can sit.So...Do you know what we do here?
My section?- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea......and leave it at that, okay?No idea. Zip. None.If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?We would be cunts.Are you calling us cunts?Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.That's right.- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.Closed casket?That's right.So tell anybody up at Deerfield...Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair....you had an uncle met his demise
like that?I got a question.How fucked up are you?Hi, Darlene.What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.Hey, I don't mind going it alone.You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.You got any suits,
or do you like......coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours......Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns......to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...- ... from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?Why are you pretending to be a cop?This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.This is an elite unit.Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt......organized crime in this city......by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI......represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.And we will do it.And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.Jackie met his demise.Last known photograph.Costello uses three key guys.That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>Delahunt, muscle.French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas......so I can pass them off as my own.Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position......in the department.
Let's go to work.Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.Baggage handler at the airport, right?Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up......on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging......in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey......on the weekends. I got that right?Yup.
You have different accents?You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?We have a question.Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?It's an honest question.Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?Hey, he can't help you.I know what you are.
I know what you are......and I know what you're not.I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.You're no fucking cop.He's right.
We deal in deception here.What we do not deal with
is self-deception.Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.Guaran-fucking-teed.You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.You don't have much family.I don't have any family.What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?When you say ""the family,""
who do you mean exactly? You?You always have to question everything,
don't you?Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.""Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?""
I mean, those are questions, right?""Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?""Do you need some money for the funeral?When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have......eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.A state-police detective.And are you a married
state-police detective?No.Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...I have a co-signer.Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.Sure.Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed......through the mercy of God
rest in peace.Amen.So what do I do?There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop......but there's a bonus involved.Tax-free.We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.Given your nature.You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink......the whole nine yards.You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.We need you, pal.You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.Do it again.For me.- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?Oh, good to see you. Come on in.They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.I got kicked out, like, four months ago.Yeah, it was in the papers.So you know.And why are we graced
with your presence?I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...My mother's dead.I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.I was at a funeral myself, man.Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.I got, like...- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.You know, after my mother passed
and everything.In your line of work, if I gave you......like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?You know what you...You know what you usually say
at these moments.- What? What?
- Come on, man.Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.What, you want me to say it?I'm not a cop, all right?- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?That's right. You used to be a cop.When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.This side of Worcester.- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.God says, as far as you're......concerned.No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.Well, I knew his father.- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.Uncle Jackie was excellent.Fucking guineas.- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.Cranberry juice.It's a natural diuretic.My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.What, do you got your period?- Fucking...!
- Get off!- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.Do you know me?No. No.Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit......and there's guys you can't.Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit......but it's almost a guy you can't hit.So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.I fucking know you. I know your family.You make one more drug deal......with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours......and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?Yeah. Yeah, I do.What are you drinking?A cranberry juice.What is it, your period?Get him a cranberry juice.Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.What? ""Oh,"" fucking what?Get the fuck out of here.Sorry I'm late.Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.His undercover work is extensive.He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.Okay, my people are out there.They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.Good. Today, girls......what I have is microprocessors.Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors......from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.These are the kind
they put into computers......that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel......from a couple hundred miles away.These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.We got a guy working
for the company two months......walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday......has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday......but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.You know where that dirtball
started his life?Southie projects.- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...- ... which happens to...
- South Boston?Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.We're here to nail Costello.All right, look. We got a guy......says Costello's moving
the processors to China.He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?Maybe. Maybe not.Maybe fuck yourself.My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.You girls have a good day.Normally he's a very nice guy.Don't judge him from this meeting alone.Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.I knew Myles.He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.I wanna get these people
who did this to him.Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people......who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?Allegedly.Allegedly.If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.But not the robbery. That's not wrong.He did something else wrong?Wave to your girlfriend, honey.I mean, fuck yourself.- Did you get that?
- ""Allegedly"" or ""fuck yourself""?- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.I need a cup of coffee.You making a house call?Have I seen you professionally?No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty......and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.I have an appointment on this floor.Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.Suffolk, nights?Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.Nice to meet you, Madolyn.Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.All right, have a nice day.Cut him here.Bye-bye.Jerk-ass!Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.I'm trying to help you.You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?You fellas come from Providence?It isn't any of your business, is it, now?What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?Hey! You are killing my business, man!Fuck!What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!Get out of here. Get out of here!- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.Was your meal okay?Yeah, no, the lobster was good.I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.I'm waiting for you to make your move.Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.I don't even know what it is.So what's it like having people
find themselves......in your office all day long?Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?- No, no, no.
- No?No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?Yeah, I do.Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.Who says I wanna see you again?Don't you?- You should see your face.
- Don't you?Course I wanna see you again.What Freud said about the Irish is......we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.Why do you do it, then?Some people do get better.Fair enough.Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.Including the criminals?If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.I'll arrest you right now.<i>My word against yours.</i>...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.I say, ""Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?""He goes, ""Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners,"" so...So I say to him,
""Princess Carolina of Monaco...""Schuyler.Do you know who I am?No.You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.His real name Mr. French?No.Come with me.I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.And this can cause me a lot of problems.Those guys you tuned up......they're connected down Providence.What they're gonna do......is come back with some guys
and kill you.Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.Unless I stop them.Do you want me to stop them?Is this something I can't do personally?I'm gonna have my associate search you.No one's searching me.
Search me for what?Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.Shoes.I knew your father.Yeah? Do you know he's dead?Oh, sorry. How'd he go?- Stand.
- He didn't complain.Yeah, that was his problem.Who said he had a problem?I just said he had a fucking problem.There's a man could've been anything.Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.- He's clean.
- Arm.Yeah, come on.What arm? What fucking arm?Show me your arm. Flip it.Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.He's clean.And if I can slander my own
environment......it makes me sad, this regression.Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan......to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.I just can't know.I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?I am not a fucking cop!Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?Yes. Yes, yes.All right, all right, all right.You're okay. You'll be all right.Get your hand taken care of.I'm sorry, but it was necessary.As for our problem with Providence......let's not cry over spilled guineas.Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?Just kidding. How's your mother?She's on her way out.We all are. Act accordingly.Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.Do you trust him?Well, these days......who's reliable?His Uncle Jackie was.Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.I'm reliable.Arnold, you're one in a million.Ten. Ten million.What about your wife, Arnold?Well, I thought she was.She wasn't.Well, she got reliable.Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?Another county heard from.One too many. She got a big mouth.Answer this for me, will you?The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.Thanks.I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.Can I meet you for lunch?All right, see you then.Who's the lead detective?Good. He's a lox.Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...<i>...and he'll say so.</i>Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.In the trunk or the glove compartment?Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.No wonder you get ahead.Have a seat, Bill.Do you know John Lennon?Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.Lennon said:""I'm an artist.You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it.""I tell you, Mr. Costello......I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.Smart-mouth.Too bad.If you'll indulge me...Now what?Choir practice.Choir practice...The point I'm making
with John Lennon is......a man could look at anything......and make something out of it.For instance......I look at you and I think:What could I use you for?Get rid of this.French.<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>Maybe we could work something out.- Good.
- And send this to his wife.It was nice the way
you asked the guy......which hand he jerked off with.I hope this don't shake Rita up.As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.That was quick.
You think he's dead already?<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i><i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years......and Costello is selling them
military technology.Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>...you let us know.So who did the two guys
from Providence?Jimmy Pappas.What happened to Jimmy Pappas?Jimmy had a rough month.Jimmy had a heart attack in jail......and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.I believe it's been in the papers.You seem quite happy with that result.It's a fucking result.Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.I think you are a cop, my son.- Where's your license?
- What license?I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.That means you're bringing
undesirable elements......into Mr. Costello's area.I was going for my fucking cigarettes!Hey.That's Jimmy Bags.- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.There's no profit, I pay him two grand.Then make more money.
This is America.You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...Hi, Captain.This crazy fuck...- ... knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.He reached into his coat.I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU......which is the right thing.I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.Bottom line......we think we might have a problem.We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.- Really?
- Yeah, really.Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?No, no, not presently.But I'm working on that.Here, Bill, this is for you.From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.You wait. We'll call you.- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.Good.Hi, Dad.I got promoted. All right.Excuse me for one second.You know......if your father were alive......and saw you here sitting with me......let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.And he could do it......which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.You can't do anything
with a man like that.Your Uncle Jackie......he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.And I think about this.So what the fuck
are we talking about here?Did you ever think about
going back to school?School?With all due respect, Mr. Costello......school is out.Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.Good day, Fathers.- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.You recall our chat?Little boys......sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...""I am as God made me.""
Was that your rationale?May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.Pay them.Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...More than one. He's one of Costello's.We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.Beeper number.- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.- And he beeped him?
- Twice.Give me your phone. Turn that off.- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.Whose briefcase is this? All right.- It's off?
- You're good.Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.- He can't do that.
- He just did.- You my attorney?
- What do you think?Have you made statements
or phone calls......I need to be made aware of?I beeped you.The card they gave me. That's it.- That's it?
- That's it.You need to call your mother......tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.So make the call.Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me......just listen to what I'm saying to you.Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>Yeah, no, you carry on without me.I'll talk to you later. Okay.Bye.Everybody out. Move.Thank you.So who are you?I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.So when the fuck am I gonna get out?All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there......and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.The light's nice here in the morning.So do you wanna talk about last night?You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.It's actually quite common.I gotta go to work.Do you lie?Why? Do you?No, I'm asking if you lie.Honesty is not synonymous with truth.Yeah, you lie.You lie.Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally......or, what, just for the fuck of it?Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.So you had a parent who was a drunk.Did you?No.Let's keep it with you.Talk about how you feel.<i>How I feel.</i><i>How I feel.</i>- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.No. Please. No.Ain't gonna hurt you.<i>You sit there...</i>...with a mass murderer.A mass murderer.Your heart rate is jacked.And your hand......steady.That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand......does not shake.Ever.Wake the fuck up.There was a cop leaving when I came in.How did you know he was a cop?Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?Should I?So do they all come in here......and cry, your cops?Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...Use their weapons?Let me tell you something.They signed up to use their weapons.Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV......so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.Except for a cop on TV.<i>I looked at your file.</i>I see that you have a record of assault.Yeah.<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?Did something happen to you?No.- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody......and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke......happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.It's been a year. I've had enough!Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.How about we just erase your file, huh?How about we erase your file......and you're just
another soldier for Costello......open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...- ... you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!For chrissake, be smart.If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?Come on, get in the car.Both of you, get in the car.When are you gonna take Costello?What's wrong with taking him
on any one......of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?I mean, he murdered somebody, right?The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?- That what you want?
- That'd stick.Will you shut up?We are building a case and it takes time.You know that.Something's wrong.I'm telling you, something's wrong.Yeah, maybe.Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?No bullshit.I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.You serious?I'm afraid so.Have you heard anything like that?Jesus Christ.Hang tight for me, kid.Just a little while longer.We are this close:All right?<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.But now that you're here......what do you want?You want the truth?Valium.If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...- ... before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.I haven't slept for fucking weeks.- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills......and you're gonna close my file?- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...- ... the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has......and what do you do?What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?You're fucking ridiculous.Two pills?Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch......and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.<i>Fuck.</i>Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?You're tired and you don't give a shit.- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.What's this?It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.Yeah?Is it enough to commit suicide?Maybe it is. All right? Okay?Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.Thank you.I'm transferring you to another counselor.- Good.
- Okay.So you wanna get a cup of coffee?Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?Come on in.Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.Yes, those.I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building......that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.- You guys know anything about this?
- No.Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.Our unit will not take action.I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside......verifies the transaction. Are we clear?Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight......we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i><i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>Your mother worked all goddamn day.We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.Oh, no, my friends are still coming.So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.Your mother will be proud.All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.The readiness is all.You know the players. Call the game.Thank you.- You ready?
- Is your highness......gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?A confessional seal, these days......I'm not so sure.He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.All cellphone signals
are under surveillance......through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.Keep an eye on this one.All right, here we go.There's Costello. Mr. French.There's Fitzy, Delahunt......and the new guy, Billy Costigan.Time is 10:46.All right, turn off your cellphones.Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?We had two hours' notice. Two hours.- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.Government man. Scared.I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise......to come to a business transaction......with automatic weapons.For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids......none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.Because here, in this country......it don't add inches to your dick.You get a life sentence for it.If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.Search randomly for calls
made from the area.Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.Then narrow the area.What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.Why did they turn their phones off?- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?The buyers are there.You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.Not to my guy.This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?Oh, who the fuck are you?I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century......they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.What we generally do, in this country......is one guy......brings the items......and the other guy......pays him.No ""tickee""......no laundry.Go ahead, Fitz.Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?Please tell me those cars aren't empty.I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!They didn't figure we had a navy.Did you put a camera in the back?Can I talk to you for a second, please?You stupid fucking hard-on!You fucked this whole thing up!What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?Meet up? You actually want me dead?Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant......for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.That's what we do first. Narrow it down.<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back....changing your life radically.Change anything. Right?
Change everything.- Right?
- Yeah.How long you been with this guy?- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.Do you love him?It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.It's very serious.Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.No more than I am.I know that it's a serious relationship.I know there are ups and downs. Right?People have doubts and problems.Well, not problems, but doubts.What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?Right? We talked about that.- Morning.
- Good morning.Want a French doughnut?Yeah.- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.Sure.- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.Look, I respect who you are......just, you know, not in the living room.We might have company.- Company?
- Yeah, company.- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.Yeah?So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?Because I believe in public service.So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!- The phone.
- Forget the phone.Get it. Answer it. Answer it.This is your first phone call
in the new house.You live here now. You're a resident.Mayor Sullivan's office.<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>Oh, my God. I'm sorry.What?I think it's a guy with...- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?Something for work.Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off......and you're not in jail.- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?Yes. Yes, I do.So earn it.I'm getting the feeling......we got a cop in my crew.Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.He's one of yours. Inside.<i>Have you seen anything?</i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?Look, Frank, if you don't relax...If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>Get me social-security numbers, get me...Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs......just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.<i>If you can get me that information...</i>...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i><i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock......up Little Miss Freud's ass.How are you, Francis?- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.And your father called you the tumor.And what did your father
call you, Charlie?Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.You're lying to me.Not exactly.What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?Microprocessors.Oh, yeah.I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys......at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation......or your life.No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.Okay, then just say that.All right, I will.Oh, that's the movers.Yeah, you still wanna stay?- Yes.
- Yeah?Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.I'm gonna get you.If you could've, you would've.But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.<i>Frankie.</i><i>Frankie!</i><i>Your mother forgives me.</i>You take off an armored car at the mall.What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?My God, is that French out there?What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor......very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.Fuck!Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.He'll trade you out.I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!It fucking hurts!Hey. It's me.- What are you doing here?
- Come here.Costello's giving people up to the FBI.- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.He's a protected fucking informant.I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.That's my son, Patrick.- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?No. No, thanks.Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.Come on.You want some coke?There it is.Don't move till you're numb.Come on. Get inside.Boss wants your real name......your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.I don't have a bank account.- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.Then we wait here.- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.Put the forms in there.I don't know if this
is how you spell ""citizens.""But fuck it, you know?No, no, no. Come here.What, are you fucking retarded
or something?That ain't fucking right.Are you kidding me?Look at this. Look.""Citizens."" Look.Billy, he said to stay here.Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.Where the fuck are you going?I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.- Hey.
- Hi.- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.Look...- ... if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.So you moving out or you moving in?I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.That's me.Yeah, I know.- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.You have to choose.- You have to make a...
- A decision.A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?Yes. Otherwise it's...Oh, I know, I know. I know.I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.Is it real?I think so.You don't have any cats.No.I like that.I don't get it.We are all convinced
that Costello has at least......one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.You will investigate everybody
and anybody.Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.I have an immaculate record.How is your wedding coming along?Great. Great. She's a doctor.- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.Yeah, it's working. Overtime.- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.Be dirty, be dirty.Yeah...Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.You're not cracking up, are you?- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this......where any cop could see you. Jesus.If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?I own the place.Why am I not fucking surprised?- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.How the fuck do you know that?- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.I gotta find myself.You're telling me, sonny boy.I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself......I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.- Right now.
- Collie......laying low is not what I do.All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?What good am I if you don't listen?Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.He's fucking smart. You know this.I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.Okay.But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you......that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department......most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?Frank, you gotta trust me.All right? Just trust me, Frank.Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?Right?Maybe because
it's always been so easy......for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.Christ.Who knows what's easy?Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.Shit!Fuck.Hey, how you doing?Hi, Darlene, hi.- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.Have a good one.I smell a rat.Jesus Christ.You got a girlfriend?No.No, no. Why, what does that matter?It depends.I'm sure by now you know......I got an informer in my outfit.Cop.Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.Jesus Christ.Are you sure it's not the FBI?It ain't the FBI.Ex-wife.Old girlfriend.Or stupid.That is what brings you down
in this business.Stupid, huh?Well, I guess that leaves me out.You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.Everybody who works for me.Right. You know, Frank......I look around at your other guys...I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?And I think, ""Could I do murder?""And all I can answer myself is:""What's the difference?""Give them up to the Almighty.You see, that's my point, you know?You accuse me once, I put up with it.You accuse me twice......I quit.You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head......as if you were anybody else. Okay?You got something
you wanna ask me?Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?One of your guys is gonna pop you.- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.I haven't needed the money......since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.But I like it.Point I'm making here is, Bill......I got this rat......this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat......and it brings up questions.You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.Girlfriend...Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?Social-security numbers.- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?Frank, look at me. Look at me.I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?I'm not the fucking rat.Start with you agree there is a rat.You said there is one, all right?I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.Sure. Sure, Will.You, William. What would you do?Frank, how many of these guys......have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.The question is,
and this is the only question......who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?The only one
who could do what I do is me.Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.You wanna be me?I probably could be you. Yeah.Yeah, I know that much.But I don't wanna be you, Frank.I don't wanna be you.""Heavy lies the crown"" sort of thing.Yeah.- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.You know what I like about restaurants?The fucking food? I don't know. What?You learn a lot watching things eat.There's a boat coming up Gloucester.French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.Eat something, for Christ's sake.In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?I got it. Okay?Excuse me...- ... French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis....cigarette.Eat something.Problem?Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.Fucking prick.- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.They want to find the leak
as much as you do.Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.No.So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source......who is here in SIU.Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i><i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i><i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i><i>Let me get you a coffee.</i><i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>...if I did it full-time, law school......I'd be through it in a year.If I wasn't a trooper.But another city. I was thinking that.Another city.Another city, huh?Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>If we're not gonna make it......it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.Yeah.Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?- What about this guy?
- Cop.Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?She ignored us so she must be a cop.She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.There's guys who answer
the questions right...- ... and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.You're a cop.What?You ignored us, you're a cop.We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.- See you later, all right?
- See you later.He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i><i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.It ain't Bill.No way, he says.Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.Good. Thank you.Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?To find out about the good Catholic life?I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely......however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.So just follow him and don't get made.Sarge, we got the target coming out.Hey. Where are you?<i>Look down the car.</i><i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>Is there a reason you would have a tail?No.- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.South Station. Wait 10 minutes.He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.You got that? 344 Wash.Yeah, he went up to the top floor.Building's empty. No tenants here.He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...He's getting spooky, captain.- What?
- I just saw him.He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.All right, all right. Listen to me.I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.Yeah?Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.- They're what?
- They're fucked.<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?All right, we'll see you there.- What?
- You were followed.- By who?
- By Costello's people.- Impossible.
- One of the cops......he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.Come on!What the fuck is going on?Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.Yeah, he must be our guy.<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?Sarge, something
just came off the building.What the fuck?Fuck.What do you mean,
off the building?- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.- Where were you?
- What happened?You're fucking late! Get in the van!What do you mean,
off the roof?What's going on? I came to meet you.- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.What came off the roof?- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.Fuck this.Fitzy! Get in the van!Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!All right. I got him.32X to CP. We're being fired upon!<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i><i>Send some back...</i>So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?- No.
- Well, a better question......is why the fuck
were your guys following him?I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.Fucking piece of shit!- All right.
- Hey, hey!- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.That's a fucking lie.He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.I need access to those files.I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.Good.- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.- I need those codes.
- No.You want those codes.So where the fuck were you?Well, boss told me to go home.Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.So where the fuck were you?I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?When I got the signal, I got the call.What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?Billy. Billy.Yeah?Yeah?You know what I thought today?What's that?Who didn't show up today is the rat.Yeah?- So?
- And you never been late in your life.When I called you......I made a mistake.I gave you the wrong address......but you showed up at the right one......didn't you?Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?Tell me why.That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.He's dead.I'm going home.<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>With me it tends to be the other guy.But Queenan.
Now I got no access.You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i><i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.<i>That Irish pissant...</i>...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.Sweetheart.You're giving me a hard-on.Are you sure it's me?Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?Watch your fucking mouth.No. You watch it.Let me straighten you out.I tried to call you a few times.I know.Listen, I can't be a friend to you.I'm sorry.Yeah......I know.Yeah.You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.Who are you?So it is you.Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.Who are you?This is Sergeant Sullivan.I'm taking over Queenan's unit.Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.We're all very upset.<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>We need you to come in.
Can you come in?<i>We'll meet...</i><i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i><i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i><i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i><i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i><i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i><i>As for who did this or why...</i><i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.Tell me how they found him so fast.Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?Must have been a big fucking dog, man.I spent all fucking night doing it, man.I'm embarrassed.I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.The cops are saying he's a cop......so I won't look for the cop.Are you soft, Fitz?When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh......you dump him in the marsh.Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday......to get a fucking blowjob!Don't laugh!This ain't reality TV!Proceed.- What?
- Yeah.You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.So get rid of them.There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.Get rid of the fucking tail!All right.Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.All units fall back.
All units fall back.It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.Load it.Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?Were you not in the fucking car?Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?Load.Go, go!Come on,
what are you waiting for?Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!Cocksuckers.Motherfucking shit!Motherfucking...!Back the fuck up!They fucking shot me.Get down!Come on, fucking bastards!Fuck it.How the fuck did this happen?You're an FBI informant?Are you fucking kidding me?Grow up.Of course I talk to the FBI.Do they know who I am?I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.Nobody knows nothing.Frank.Frank. Frank.Do they know about me?I know about you, Collie.You know I'd never give you up.- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?To you? Is that what this is about?All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.Fucking rat prick!<i>Frank?</i>Yeah?Who's this?Gwen?Where the hell's Frank?Frank got shot.Gwen, we lost Frank.I got him!I got Costello here!Hey, good job, sarge.No, it's...For you.- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.He's been waiting here
a long time for you.How'd you get him without the files?Caller ID on Queenan's phone.You know that guy?Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.Good to see you, trooper.- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.- Yeah.
- So.Now, how long were you undercover?Long time.- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.Well, I can't even tell you the debt...I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?It's the highest honor we got.Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?- That's all.
- All right.- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.How's that working for you?Is it helpful?What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.I'm all done being a cop, all right?I just want my money
and I wanna go home.All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.Fair enough.I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.It's my name.William Costigan Jr.They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.It's your name.All right.Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.I know.I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?I'm not.Listen. I've gotta give you something.Something I need you to keep.For me.Okay?- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.You're the only person
I can trust, all right?Please.- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.There's no one else.- I'm really sorry.
- I...You know, I have...- I...
- Whatever you have to say......think about it real hard, all right?If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?I was dreaming I was dead.Death is hard. Life is much easier.- What's this?
- Open it.- Really?
- Yeah.Really?Yeah.And they say
that this little speck......is a penis.It's a boy.Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.Can you still...?<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i><i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i><i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i><i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i><i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i><i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i><i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i><i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i><i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>What?What?<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i><i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i><i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i><i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i><i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>Hey, I can explain that!Costello recorded everything.He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.His lawyer came to me.Imagine that, you rat fuck.<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back......you two-faced faggot.- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.You keep your cell on.Open the door.Open... Didn't we already talk about this?This is my job.- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!Put the fucking gun down!Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.- Hands!
- Just act professional.- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.He was working for me.
He was my informant.Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.I'm still fucking arresting you.Get up.Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.I called you. You specifically. Look:You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!Maybe you do.But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.I'm taking him downstairs now.You know who I am.Shut up.I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury......you fucking cocksucker.This is gonna be fucking fun.Just fucking kill me.Just fucking kill me.I am killing you.Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.It's you and me now, you understand?We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?Give me that.<i>Right. Slow. March.</i><i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i><i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i><i>...and strike him in the head.</i><i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i><i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>...and discovered that they had expired.I just wanna go on record.I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.

Patton|1970|96|George C. Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Bates, Edward Binns|Franklin J. Schaffner|"(CHATTERING)MAN: Ten-hut!(SILENCE)(BUGLE PLAYS)Be seated.(SHUFFLING)Now, I want you to remember......that no bastard ever won a war......by dying for his country.He won it......by making the other poor dumb
bastard die for his country.Men......all this stuff you've heard
about America not wanting to fight......wanting to stay out of the war......is a lot of horse dung.Americans......traditionally love to fight.All real Americans love
the sting of battle.When you were kids......you all admired
the champion marble shooter......the fastest runner, big-league
ball players, the toughest boxers.Americans love a winner......and will not tolerate a loser.Americans play to win all the time.I wouldn't give a hoot in hell
for a man who lost and laughed.That's why Americans have never lost
and will never lose a war......because the very thought
of losing......is hateful to Americans.Now......an army is a team.It lives, eats, sleeps,
fights as a team.This individuality stuff
is a bunch of crap.The bilious bastards who wrote
that stuff about individuality......for the Saturday Evening Post......don't know anything more about real
battle than they do about fornicating.Now we have the finest food
and equipment......the best spirit......and the best men in the world.You know......by God, I actually pity those poor
bastards we're going up against.By God, I do.We're not just going to shoot
the bastards......we're going to cut out
their living guts......and use them to grease
the treads of our tanks.We're going to murder those lousy
Hun bastards by the bushel.Now......some of you boys......I know are wondering......whether or not you'll chicken out
under fire. Don't worry about it.I can assure you......that you will all do your duty.The Nazis......are the enemy.Wade into them!Spill their blood!
Shoot them in the belly!When you put your hand......into a bunch of goo......that a moment before was
your best friend's face......you'll know what to do.There's another thing
I want you to remember.I don't want to get any messages
saying we are ""holding our position. ""We're not ""holding"" anything.
Let the Hun do that.We're advancing constantly. We're not
interested in holding on to anything......except the enemy.We're going to hold on to him
by the nose and kick him in the ass.We're going to kick the hell
out of him all the time......and we're going to go through him
like crap through a goose!Now......there's one thing......that you men will be able to say
when you get back home.And you may thank God for it.Thirty years from now when you're
sitting around your fireside......with your grandson on your knee......and he asks you:""What did you do in the great
World War II?""You won't have to say:""Well......I shovelled shit in Louisiana. ""All right, now, you sons of bitches......you know how I feel.I will be proud......to lead you wonderful guys
into battle anytime......anywhere.That's all.(JEEPS RUMBLING)(DOG BARKS)The Arabs need food and clothing.They strip our dead before
we can even bury them.Looks like the reports were
pretty accurate.Sixty-one armored vehicles,
45 tons of ammunition......twenty-five 40mm guns,
three self-propelled 105s.Not counting mortars, machine guns,
rifles......pistols, telescopes, belt buckles,
Gl socks.One thousand, eight hundred men.(CHEERING)(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)Our people salute you, general......for your brilliant amphibious

tremble at his approach. ""I appreciate that, Excellency.(BAND PLAYS)Magnificent!I wish our troops looked that good.Tell me, general,
what do you think of Morocco?I love it, Excellency.It's a combination
of the Bible and Hollywood.BRADLEY: These men fight at Kasserine?
CARVER: Yes, sir.For the American Army to take
a licking like that......the first time at bat
against the Germans...Up against Rommel, what we need
is the best tank man we've got.Somebody tough enough
to pull this outfit together.- Patton?
- Possibly.God help us.(SIREN WAILS)(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)Lieutenant......where is the duty officer?Sir...- He said he's caught at shaving.
- Why isn't he here on duty?Guess he needed a shave.We got a new commanding general
due today.(CRASHING)MAN: Who the hell is kicking me
in the butt?Oh, sorry, sir.- What were you doing down there?
- Trying to get some sleep, sir.Well...Get back down there, son.You're the only son of a bitch here
who knows what he's trying to do.Yes, sir.PATTON: Brad, how the hell are you?
- Fine, George. Good to see you.We were all under the impression
you wouldn't be here until 0900.Yes, I gathered that.- You know my boy, Dick Jenson.
- Yes.Brad, tell me.- What are you doing here?
- Ike wanted a report on Kasserine.Meanwhile, I have to stay here
as an observer......but I report directly to Ike.You're spying.Get me General Eisenhower's
headquarters.Tell me, Brad......what happened at Kasserine?
I heard it was a shambles.Apparently, everything went wrong.We'd send over a 75mm shell,
the krauts would return an 88.Their tanks are diesels.Even when we managed to hit one
they kept on running. Our tanks...The men call them
""Purple Heart boxes. ""One hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes.I warned them about the tank.I taIked to one of the
soldiers about the half-tracks.I asked them if the machine-gun
bullets pierced the armor.And he said, ""No, sir.They just come through one side
and rattle around a bit. ""I understand they had a little trouble
coordinating the air cover.The trouble was no air cover.- General Smith on the line, sir.
- Excuse me, Brad.Bedell?Listen, I'm calling about Bradley
and his job here.I need a good number-two man, I want
to make Brad my deputy commander.You clear it with Ike?All right, thanks, Bedell.Now you're not spying for Eisenhower
anymore, you're working for me.- Okay?
- Fine, okay.Dick. You got those stars?- Yes, sir.
- Let's get them on.What's the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.I know, but it doesn't become official
until it's approved by the Senate.Well......they have their schedule
and I have mine.George......if you were named admiral
of the Turkish Navy......I believe your aides could dip
into their haversacks......and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank.Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.You know...I think those stars look better
on a green shirt.Did I ever tell you about the time I
designed a uniform for tank crewmen?It was green leather,
it had red stripes......and sort of a row of brass buttons
down across here.And topped off
by a gold football helmet.The Army rejected it, of course.Goddamn, it was beautiful.(WHISTLE BLOWS)Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.George, there's one other thing I put
in my Kasserine report.Some of our boys
were just plain scared.That's understandable.Even the best foxhound is gun-shy
the first time out.I can remember......when nothing frightened me
as much as the idea of......a bullet coming
straight for my nose.I don't know why, but the image of a
bullet coming right for my nose......was more horrible
than any other possibility.Well, I can understand that,
with such a handsome nose.You want to know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it?Blind man could see it in a minute.They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.Why should they fight like soldiers?You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.ln about 15 minutes we're going
to start turning these boys......into fanatics, razors.They'll lose their fear
of the Germans.I hope to God they never lose
their fear of me.Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?Have all my officers
finished breakfast?We're open from 6 till 8.Most of the officers are
just coming in, sir.Please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed.But, sir! It's only a quarter to 8.From now on, you will open at 6
and no one will be admitted after 6: 15.Where are your leggings?Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.You're a soldier.$20 fine.Gentlemen......from this moment any man......without leggings, without a helmet,
without a tie...Any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform......is going to be skinned.This is a barracks.
It's not a bordello.(CHATTERING)- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.Doctor.Sir.I understand you have two cases
of self-inflicted wounds.Yes, sir, we do.Get them out of here.One has developed a serious infection.I don't care if he dies,
just get him out of here.Doesn't belong in the same room
with men wounded in battle.- I'll see that they're moved.
- One more thing.There'll be no ""battle fatigue. ""
That's an order.Battle fatigue is a free ride
to the hospital.I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.Yes, sir.Doctor...
Where's your helmet?I don't wear a helmet
in the hospital.Start.I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.Well......then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can.And get those yellow-bellies
out of here, today.Hold it.Turn right, here.The battlefield is ahead.Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.He was out here yesterday.It's over there. Turn right, damn it.It was here.The battlefield was here.The Carthaginians
defending the city......were attacked by three
Roman legions.They were brave, but they
couldn't hold. They were massacred.Arab women......stripped them of their tunics
and their swords and lances.The soldiers lay naked in the sun......2000 years ago.I was here.You don't believe me.You know what the poet said:""Through the travail of agesIt's the pomp and toils of warHave I fought and strove and perishedCountless times upon the starAs if through a glass and darklyThe age-old strife I seeWhere I fought in many guises
Many namesBut always me. ""You know who the poet was?Me.<font color=""#FFFF00"">Sir, the interrogation reports on
the American prisoners...</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">...captured in our victory at Kasserine.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">They are not very good soldiers,
these Americans.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">I'm not so sure...</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">...after only one battle.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Their tanks were no match for our guns.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">And neither was their leadership, sir.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">At Kasserine they were not
under American command.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">They were under the
British General Anderson.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">British commanders and American troops...
the worst of everything!</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">I remind you that Montgomery
is a British Commander.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">And he has driven us half
way across Africa.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Anyway, we have met the Americans
for the first time and defeated them.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">I'm optimistic.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">You can afford to be an optimist, I can't.</font>There's an opportunity
for us to mount an offensive.We've concentrated on the flank......draw strength from the British.It appears now that we could......split the African corridor.Drive through Rommel to the sea.I'm sorry, but that territory
has been reserved......for General Bernard Law Montgomery.We're supposed to let him win this one
no matter what.They're entitled to have their hero.Montgomery did push Rommel
clear across North Africa.What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?You have anybody in mind?Air Vice-Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.Excuse me, gentlemen......while I ask our British friends
what's happened to our air cover.BRADLEY:
Harry.How are you?George. Good to see you.- You know Arthur Coningham.
- Sir Arthur.Delighted to see you.I've heard so much about you.Gentlemen, it appears there's been a
slight misunderstanding here......and Ike thought we should fix it.No, no. No misunderstanding.We're supposed to have Allied
air cover and we don't.German planes are strafing my troops.If I may say so, general, I'm afraid
your operation reports are inaccurate.Report? Three days ago, the crowds
took off after my command car......ran my ass into a ditch.My staff has assured me,
we have complete air supremacy......everywhere in the Mediterranean.PATTON:
When I complained about air cover......you said our troops
were not battleworthy.You spoke of the discredited practice
of using air force as an alibi......for lack of success on the ground.I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.I sincerely apologize for that remark,
whoever made it.And I promise you one thing, general:You will see no more German planes.(CHICKEN SQUAWKS)We were discussing air supremacy,
Sir Arthur.(HORN HONKS)(GUNFIRE)Damn door won't open!By God, that's enough!Get that thing out of here!Come on, you bastards,
take a shot at me on the nose!Get back in here, George! We need
a corps commander, not a casualty.CONINGHAM:
How'd you manage to stage that?I don't know......but if I could find
the Nazis flying those things......I'd give them each a medal.PATTON: Can't get over how cold
it gets in the desert.Awfully cold, sir.PATTON: Rommel's out there somewhere,
waiting for me.JENSON:
Yes, sir.PATTON:
You know......if I had my way, I'd send
that genius son of a bitch......an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter:A challenge in two stanzas
to meet me alone in the desert.I'll deliver it.Rommel in his tank and me in mine.We'd stop about 20 paces.
We'd get out, we'd shake hands......then we'd button up and do battle,
just the two of us.That battle would decide
the outcome of the war.It's too bad jousting's
gone out of style.It's like your poetry, general.It isn't part of the 20th century.You're right, Dick.The world grew up.Hell of a shame.Dick, I want a 24-hour guard
put around this area.If we don't, the Arabs will dig
them up for their clothes.Yes, sir.Our graves aren't gonna disappear
like everybody else's who fought here.The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians.God, how I hate the 20th century.<font color=""#FFFF00"">Captain Steiger reporting, General.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Come with me, Steiger.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Field Marshal Rommel...
I hope you are feeling better...</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Captain Steiger has been assigned

of the American Civil War.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">He was educated at the
Virginia Military Institute and West Point.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">You're not telling me anything

to hit us near El Guettar.Rommel, huh?(BRAYS)All my life......I've wanted to lead a lot of men
in a desperate battle.Now I'm going to do it.Look.Battalion strength at least.They haven't spotted our positions yet.They'll get an education
in about 10 seconds.Wait till they get a dose of
that artillery fire.Commence firing.
Fire at will.Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.What a hell of a waste
of fine infantry.- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.Sir, I can't raise him.Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's
where we hold them by the nose......and kick them in the ass.
Go on.Put him in my car.(PLANE WHINES)Rommel......you magnificent bastard.
I read your book!PATTON: Captain Richard N. Jenson
was a fine boy.Loyal, unselfish and efficient.I am terribly sorry.There are no coffins here
since there is no wood.We will have a trumpeter
and an honor guard......but we will not fire the volleys as
people would think an air raid was on.I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair
in a letter to his mother.He was a fine man......and a fine officer.And he had no vices.I shall miss him a lot.I can 't see the reason
such fine young men get killed.There are so many battles

You think Patton will attack Sardinia?</font>(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)<font color=""#FFFF00"">And why not?</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Patton, sir... is a military historian.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">He knows that Sicily, not Sardinia,
has always been the key to Italy.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">If Patton has his way he will attack
Sicily at Syracuse, as the Athenians did.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Steiger, this is the twentieth century!</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">But you must understand, sir...
Patton is a sixteenth-century man.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">May I read an example?</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">""On a dark street in New York 1922,
wearing white tie and tails...</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">""...Patton saw three men pushing
a young girl into the back of a truck.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">""He leaped out of his car,
produced a revolver...</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">""...and forced the men at gunpoint
to release the girl"".</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">It turned out that the girl was the
fiancÃ©e of one of the men.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">They were merely helping
her into the truck.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">What could be more revealing?</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">I don't know what youâre talking about.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Don Quixote encounters six merchants

because that's what the Athenians did!</font>General Bradley's done
a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.He's moved into Bizerte
and taken over 41,000 prisoners.Good. Very good.You're not surprised, are you?
After all, you trained that outfit.- Excuse me, general.
- Hm?This is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.- Who says so?
- G2, sir.When we took 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.Also, Hitler probably
retained Rommel in Berlin......because things were going badly
for the Africa Corps.He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.I'm my favorite general,
and I don't like to be told......that some second-stringer
is up against me. Then I lose face.Who the hell are you, anyway?CARVER: General, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman. Your new aide.Codman. I pulled your name off
the list because I know your family.I'm glad you did, sir.Rommel is the best the krauts have,
and I kicked the hell out of him.Now my own G2 section is telling
me he wasn't even there.But, general, he undoubtedly
planned the German battle.If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've
defeated Rommel. lsn't that true?Codman...- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.I have a plan
for the invasion of Sicily.I want to make sure I get it approved.
You can help me.I want to give a dinner
for General Alexander.Get to him before Montgomery does.This will be strictly a formal affair,
Codman, but purely social.By that I mean...- ...purely political.
- Yes, sir.I want the finest food, the best wine
available. Everything, comme il faut.(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)Thank you.George, this is really splendid wine.Thank you, Arthur.Thank you.Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades
in the Peloponnesian War......415 B.C.He said, ""If Syracuse falls, all
Sicily falls, and then Italy. ""He knew that Syracuse was the
jugular of the island.Old Alcibiades always went
for the throat.I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.- How's it going?
- The old man has them in his pocket.PATTON:
Now, according to my plan......General Montgomery will land here.I'll hit the beaches here,
take Palermo.Monty will drive north on the coast,
I'll come due east......take Messina and cut off
the German escape route.Yes...It looks like an interesting plan.Well, gentlemen,
to the conquest of Sicily.ALEXANDER:
To the conquest of Sicily.OFFICERS:
To Sicily!George, you'd have made a great
marshal for Napoleon......if you'd lived in the 18th century.But I did, sir. I did.Morning. Is General Smith in?MAN: I believe he's in the lavatory.
- Thank you.- Ah, there you are, Bedell.
- Monty.Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of
thought to the Sicily operation.Yes?I assume we're alone.Georgie Patton has already
discussed his plan with Alexander.I realize that......but I have an idea that his plan
may lead to an absolute disaster.Oh?Bedell, look.This is Sicily.Now then, according to Patton's plan......I will attack Syracuse here.And he would attack Palermo up here.Now, obviously our forces would be
divided.And obviously, they
could be chopped up piecemeal.Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way......is this.(MONTGOMERY EXHALES)I will land at Syracuse as planned.But the Americans-
The Americans will land here, at Gela.I will advance north to Messina,
the Americans protecting my flank.After all, Messina is the key.It's the reason for invading Sicily.I'll discuss your plan with Ike.I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?That the plans for the
invasion of Sicily......should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.George, I have bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.Ike has turned it down.Since the Italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time......and the German resistance is
stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.- Well, where do my people land then?
- In the Gulf of Gela.There's nothing there
but a beach.Yes, but it puts you in a good
position to support Montgomery.Where does Montgomery land?He'll land in Syracuse and drive north
to Catania. Possibly even Messina.And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.I see.ln other words, we get the burden again
while good old Monty gets the glory.Ike had to consider all points of view.He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.No......I've been in the Army 30 years.When I get an order, I say, ""Yes, sir. ""
And I do my best to carry it out.This is what happens when your
commander stops being an American......and starts being an Ally.<font color=""#FFFF00"">Here's the gangster Patton,
landing at Gela with his Seventh Army.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">This film was captured after the landing.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">I didn't realize he was so tall.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Over six feet.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">He's constantly giving
personal commands.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Obviously they now have two prima donnas in Sicily...
Montgomery and Patton!</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">There's another three-star general.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">General Bradley...Commander
of the American II Corps.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">He looks like a common soldier.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">He is most capable, yet unpretentious.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Unusual for a general.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Sorry...</font>I don't think I've made
myself clear, sir.It's true, Montgomery met the
toughest resistance there at Catania.However, if we're-Perfectly clear.Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.But this order from
General Alexander......directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.Well, then, old Bradley will have to
slug- slug, mind you......his way up center of the island over
those tough mountain roads, won't he?Yes, sir.Messina, Bell.Messina......is the heart of it. If they'd
followed my plan, I'd be there by now.I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!Now, you know what I'm gonna do?I'm gonna go to Palermo.I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina
if it's the last thing I ever do!Hey, what's all this talk about taking
the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.Now, that road was assigned to me.How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run
into tough opposition. Very tough.You wouldn't be taking advantage of
this situation, would you?I don't know what you're talking about.Without that road, your army,
except for my 2nd Corps......would be out of a job.Free for you to go into Palermo.Who said anything about Palermo?I can read a map.Does Alexander know
you've pushed out this far?That's a reconnaissance in force.George......are you saying I've got to slug
it out in those mountains......with heavy resistance?Just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?General......I just follow my orders.Like the simple old soldier I am.General Bradley.Sir, General Alexander has heard
we're moving west.He says here, ""Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.Repeat. Stop, immediately. ""That's what you think it says.I think it was garbled
in transmission.Ask them to re-transmit the message.That'll take half a day at least.Yes, sir.Now, Brad.Where were we?We were talking about a simple......old soldier.Look at that, gentlemen.Compared to war......all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.Let's go, sergeant.
Move out!Give me that helmet.Come on, let's get out of here!What silly son of a bitch
is in charge of this operation?I don't know, but they
ought to hang him.PATTON:
Afternoon, Padre.PADRE: These men are here from the
States, looking over our program......for the spiritual welfare
of the men.We'll take you right into Palermo.Col. David toured us around
your quarters......and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?I sure do.Every goddamn day.<font color=""#FFFF00"">Sir, the Americans have taken Palermo!</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Damn!</font>Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!Damn!(CHEERING)(BAND PLAYS)Palermo's the most conquered city
in history.First the Phoenicians......the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.Then came the Arabs......Spaniards, Neapolitans.Now comes......the American Army.This is from General Alexander, sir......reminding you that you are
not to take Palermo.Send him a message, Cod.Ask him if he
wants me to give it back.PATTON: Let me ask you a question
for a change.You've just come from Washington.How do they feel about our boys
taking Palermo?The general impression is, your army
barreled through token resistance......while Montgomery faced the brunt
of the fighting.Don't they know we took on
the Hermann Gï¿½ring division?Toughest outfit in the German Army.The people at home
are interested in you.They're curious about your
pearl-handle revolvers.They're ivory. Only a pimp
from a New Orleans whorehouse......would carry a pearl handle.What about your language?When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.What do your troops feel about that?I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.Ernie Pyle says you have a secret
weapon here: General Bradley.Ernie calls him ""The GI General. ""Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.MAN:
What's your feeling about Montgomery?PATTON:
He's the best general the English have.He seems more concerned with not
losing than he does about winning.He's not aggressive enough,
is that correct?Look, I've been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.Yesterday, the office told me
that my Italian prisoners......didn't have enough latrine.They didn't know what a
latrine was till I showed them.If I've said anything too critical
of my British colleague......let's forget about it.I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.I'm gonna beat that......gentleman to Messina.Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what
this madman Patton is saying?He's going to save our skins
by taking Messina.This report might interest you.Here I am in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria and Germans......while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.Well!Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.He's not going to get Messina.That's reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.(BOMBS EXPLODING)It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1 st Division is bogged down.You're bogged down too.What we need is another end run
just to break things loose.- Lucian. How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.Come in, come in. We need another
one of your amphibious specialties.Lucian, I want you to send a
reinforced battalion by sea......to make a landing up here at Brolo
behind the kraut lines.You want me to do a land-based attack.Right. I want a coordinated
attack the morning of the 11 th.I don't think we can make it
by the 11 th.- Hell, it's only 15, 20 miles.
- My boys have been dying for yards.Hm.Maybe you better kick a few butts
if you have to.I recommended you for your DSM
in your last promotion.I know what you can do when
you put your mind to it.Excuse me, sir.I'm sorry, but I can't
do the impossible.You're too old an athlete to think
you can postpone a scheduled match.You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.If we can't back Lucian up by land,
our end run could be a disaster.Those men might get caught
on the beach and cut to pieces.- What's the matter?
BRADLEY: All we're saying is......not to rush in until we're ready.Give him an extra day.Just one more day.The landing is on.We're going to Messina.We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.- What's so important about that?
- General Truscott......if your conscience won't permit
you to conduct this operation......I'll find somebody who can.General, it's your privilege to
relieve me anytime you want to.This match will not be postponed.Any questions?No, sir.You're a very good man, Lucian.You want to guard against
being too conservative.Remember what
Frederick the Great said:''L 'audace, I'audace!
Toujours I'audace!''Go on, have a drink.Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking
for the next couple of days.If anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.You're not going, so forget about it.You believe Truscott's right?No.But you're gambling
with those boys' lives......just to beat Montgomery
into Messina.If you pull it off, you're a hero,
but if you don't...What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.He doesn't share in your dreams
of glory, he's stuck here.He's living out every day, day-to-day,
with death tugging at his elbow.There's one big difference
between you and me, George.I do this job because I've been
trained to do it.You do it because......you love it.The men on the beach are
catching hell, general.The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.I can't break through to the coast.I'm going down there myself.PATTON:
Colonel!How did he get over there?PATTON:
What the hell are you waiting for?Looking for a place to ford, general.I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.PATTON: I've done that. Down there
this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.Get that outfit cranked up
or you'll be out of a job!- And put that helmet on.
- Yes, sir.Move it! Let's go!- What's holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.Planes!Come on, move it!Pull up over there.- Come on.
- What's going on here?Sir, these mules-Jackasses!You let a column get stalled and
strafed on account of two jackasses?!(GUNSHOT)No. No.Now, dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!We're pinned down because
we can't get air support!Nobody's getting any air support!Put fire into this battalion,
or I'll get somebody who can.Major!- You the executive officer here?
- Yes, sir.- Your name?
- WaIker.You're now commanding officer.You've got 4 hours to break through
that beachhead.If you don't make it, I'll fire you.50,000 men on this island would
like to shoot that son of a bitch.Please take me home.
Take me home.Please take me home.
Take me home.- There he goes, ""Old Blood and Guts. ""
- Yeah, our blood. His guts.Hi, how are you, son?Where are you from, Gomez?California, sir.Me too.- Where were you hit?
- In the chest, sir.Well......this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.Didn't have any head either.You get well quickly, son.(INDISTINCT)(SOLDIER CRIES)What's the matter with you?I guess I just can't take it, sir.What did you say?It's my nerves, sir.I just can't stand
the shelling anymore.Your nerves?Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.Shut up!I won't have
a yellow bastard crying......in front of these
brave, wounded men.Shut up!Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.I won't have sons of bitches afraid to
fight stink up this place of honor.You're going back to the front,
my friend.You may get shot, you may get killed,
but you're going up to the fighting.Either that or I'll stand you up
in front of a firing squad.I should shoot you myself,
you bastard! Get him out of here!Send him up to the front!You hear me? You goddamn coward!I won't have cowards in my army.I had to kick a few butts......but Truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach.Have you seen the casualty lists?Yes, I've seen them.What's the word from the coast road?The 3rd Division's east of Brolo,
heading toward Messina.Let's get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.General Bradley......it's time to consider how many
casualties we'd have......if we were still crawling on
that goddamn road.Forward, march!Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.Pity. I shaved close this morning
to prepare for getting smacked by you.Forward, march!You wanted to see me, George?Got a letter here from Ike.I was rereading Caesar's
Commentaries last night.In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to
distinguish him from his men.I was struck by that fact because-""Despicable. "" First time anybody's
ever applied that word to me.Well, at least it's a personal
reprimand, it's not official.The man was yellow. He should've
been tried for cowardice and shot.People have taken a lot worse
than a little kick in the pants.I ruffled his pride a bit.
What's that compared to war?Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general...- ...since Stonewall Jackson.
- Now they draw cartoons about you.Dirty bastard!They got me holding a little Gl
and kicking him with an iron boot.You see that, what's on my boot?
A swastika.On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!""You will apologize to the soldier

that speak lies......shall be stopped.Ten-hut!PATTON:
At ease.I thought I'd stand up here
and let you people see......if I am as big a son of a bitch
as some of you think I am.I assure you I had no intention......of being either harsh or cruel
in my treatment of the......soldier in question.My sole purpose was to try
to restore in him......some appreciation of his
obligations as a man......and as a soldier.If one can shame a coward......I felt one might help him
to regain his self-respect.This was on my mind.Now, I freely admit......that my method was wrong......but I hope you understand
my motive......and will accept this......explanation......and this......apology.- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!Good evening, general. I want to
report on a private poll I'm taking.What poll?The fan mail.Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.And that 11 % of protest, in most
cases, is both obscene and anonymous.But the pro letters are mostly from
relatives and servicemen.""I want you to know we're proud
our son is serving in your army.From the newspaper, we're not clear
exactly what you did and why......but we want you to know
we're for you.Keep going, and God bless you. ""Keep going, huh?Where?I thought you might like a sip
of wine, general. It's New Year's.You didn't celebrate at all
last night.I'm sick of sitting around this......royal doghouse.We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.Cod.I've been relieved.They've relieved me from command
of the 7th Army.I don't believe it.Happy New Year.Just a minute, sir.Since they're sure to give you
another command......isn't it logical they'd
relieve you here first?You mean command of all American
troops going into Europe?It's possible. I know it's been
discussed from time to time.The logic of it is so obvious,
it couldn't mean anything else.Sir, I'm going to open
this bottle of wine.No, Sir Cod......but if you find a bottle of cognac,
I'll help you drink it.- How you feeling tonight, general?
- Not bad, not bad at all.- Get me some writing paper, will you?
- Yes, sir.Your wife ever give you the devil
for not writing?All the time, sir.Only I don't write as often as you
do. Don't seem to get around to it.Lucky for us we got them.Who wants to marry a couple of
broken-down old horse captains?That's what my wife says to me
every time I come home, sir.Why are you up so late, George?Thought you'd like a nice hot bath
or something.I got this sleeping pill from the doc,
just in case you need it.Sleeping pill!- What's going on here?
- I heard the news, sir.- They announced it on the radio.
- What news?About General Bradley, sir. How they
gave him the top American command.Oh.Oh, yeah.I just thought you might be
feeling kind of low, sir.Your writing things, sir.
Here on the desk, sir.Yeah. Thank you, George.One little dog face.One measly little slap.
That's what done it.Ah, George.I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch.(CLAPPING)(PATTON SPEAKS IN FRENCH)He's paying tribute to the Free French
Forces under DeGaulle and Leclerc.(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)And to the people of the Resistance......who risk their lives
to help destroy the Germans.""France will be free again.
I give you my word. """"Just as Free French troops liberated
Corsica, Napoleon's place of birth......I will someday land in France to
liberate the birthplace of Lafayette. ""General, the reporters would like
a word with you.- Good afternoon.
- General.Can you tell us the purpose
of this visit to Corsica?General Eisenhower ordered me here.You wrote the mother of the boy you
slapped, ""The rat should've been shot. ""- Is that true, general?
- No comment.Sir, I understand
Gen. Alexander suggested......you take over Gen. Clark's
Italian campaign......but it was killed
due to the incident.- No comment.
- Can you say where you're going, sir?Off the record,
Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta.Interview concluded.You plan on slapping
any soldiers there, general?<font color=""#FFFF00"">Malta?</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Yes, sir.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Malta as a base...</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">...then southern Greece.
That is possible.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Get me Field Marshal Keitel.</font>PATTON: In 1528, these forts
were defended by......400 Knights of Malta
and 800 mercenaries......against a force of 40,000 Turks.Codman.- Still no word from Gen. Eisenhower?
- No, sir.Not even a response about
the two turkeys I sent for Christmas?No, sir.Go ahead, gentlemen.
Take a closer look for yourselves.Looks like you boys have hitched
your wagon to a falling star.Pass the word.
If anyone wants out, I'll understand.Sir, I can speak for the entire staff.We want to stay with you, no matter
what duty you're assigned to.Up in London, they're planning
the invasion of Europe.I've trained my mind,
body and spirit for that.What, in God's name, am I doing here?All right.Let's get on to Cairo.See if the pyramids
are still standing.<font color=""#FFFF00"">There is only one reason
for him to be in Cairo.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">To confer with the Greek and
Yugoslav governments in exile.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Let the Italians garrison Italy,
it's their country.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">We'll need our German troops to
reinforce Crete and the Greek coast...</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">...if Patton strikes from Egypt!</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">I have some new information, sir.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Patton is under severe criticism.
He may even be court-martialed.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">He slapped an enlisted man.</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">You believe their newspapers?</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Would they sacrifice their best commander
because he slapped a soldier?</font>- This place is for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, sir.Whoever found it has a genius
for cloak and dagger.Who picked this cathouse?I think it was Gen. Smith, sir.To spite me, that son of a bitch.- Welcome to London, Georgie.
- Bedell. How are you?- Is Ike here?
- He asked me to brief you.Would you excuse us, please?Let me put you straight about Ike.We hear a lot about you
criticizing his decisions.Not really. You know me.
I'm just an old fool.At times, I do wonder whether
he isn't a limey at heart.George, this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history.Ike's trying to hold it together
and lick the Germans at the same time.- It's a hell of a job.
- I understand.You have an important assignment
connected to the Normandy invasion.Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan
and there's a number of flaws in it.You can't depend on Monty taking
Cannes by D-day. He'll never make it.I've drawn up an alternate plan
to land at Calais...- ...following an air bombardment-
- Will you just listen for a change?Ike stood by you when everyone,
I mean everyone......wanted Patton
with a rope around his neck.We're gonna let it leak out
that you are here undercover.That you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais.We hope to pin down
the German 15th Army there......so that they can't be used
against us at Normandy.Is that all I'm good for?We're going to build an army
of 12 divisions around you.All fictitious, of course.Dummy troop concentrations,
dummy landing craft......simulated radio traffic.The Germans are convinced that you
will lead the main invasion effort.Their agents will spot you soon......then we can move you to Knutsford.- What do I do there?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.Frankly, George, you're on probation.Take my advice and behave yourself.Remember......your worst enemy
is your own big mouth.(BAND PLAYS)Look at this nasty-faced
son of a bitch. Ready for combat.I'll call him William
as in ""the Conqueror. ""- Sir, should we leave him in the car?
- No. Good afternoon, ladies.Good afternoon.(WILLIE BARKS)Watch this, Cod.- Sir, he'll kill that dog.
- I'll hold him.I'm terribly sorry, general.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?That's quite all right, madam.This way, sir.Your name isn't William.It's Willie.WOMAN:
My dear friends.General George S. Patton, Jr.,
has accepted our invitation......to say a few words to you......on the occasion
of this inaugural ceremony.General Patton is not here
in an official capacity......and I have assured him
most earnestly......that nothing he says
will be quoted.May I present General Patton.- Remember, sir, watch your language.
- Yeah.My dear ladies.Until today......my only experience
at welcoming has been......to welcome Germans and Italians
to the infernal region.At this I have been
quite successful......since the troops, which I have had
the honor to command......have, to date, killed or captured......some 170,000 of our enemies.I feel that such clubs as these
are of very real value......because I believe
with Mr. Bernard Shaw......that the British and the Americans
are two peoples......separated by a common language.Since it is the destiny of the British
and Americans to rule the world......the better we know each other......the better we will do it.The Russians,
don't forget the Russians.I think that a club like this......is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding.Because as soon as our soldiers meet
and get to know the English ladies......and write home and tell our women
just how lovely you truly are......then the sooner the American ladies
will get jealous......and force this war
to a quick termination.And then I'll get the chance to go
to the Pacific and kill Japanese.NARRATOR:
All over the nation......mass meetings are held to protest
General Patton 's statement...... that Britain and America
will rule the post war world.That Russia will have no say.Congressional leaders like Senator
Clayburn Foss are quick to react.This man has insulted
our Russian allies......implying Anglo-American world rule.In my opinion, he should be
severely disciplined.This time I didn't do a damn thing.They promised there
wouldn't be any reporters.I made a few remarks off the record.Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.You know how suspicious the Russians
are of the British and us.I was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies.If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd
have mentioned the sons of bitches.Bedell, I don't know
anything about politics.I have no political ambitions.All I want to do is
to command an army in combat.Well, it's out of our hands now.Ike sent a message last night
to the chief of staff.Now it's up to General Marshall
whether you stay here as a decoy......or he sends you home.He's a good man.At least he's a fair man.I'll let it sit with him.PATTON:
George......our war is over.Over, sir?It's just a question of waiting
for the orders now.I feel I'm...I'm destined to achieve some
great thing. What, I don't know.But this last incident is......so trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect-It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.Yes, sir.The last great opportunity
of a lifetime......an entire world at war
and I'm left out of it?No, sir.God will not permit this to happen!I am going to be allowed
to fulfil my destiny!His will be done.NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious
operation ever attempted......a predawn naval bombardment
prepares the way......for allied soldiers to assault
the Normandy beaches......and claw out a desperate foothold
on the continent of Europe.I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen
on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.And here they are all hung up
in the hedgerow country.They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.Then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running.But they don't listen to me.What a way to enter
the continent of Europe.Along with all the rest
of the spare parts.Sir, everything on this plane
is high priority.Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you
unless he had something in mind.I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.I'm gonna play the game.If I forget, you remind me.- I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.Yes, sir.Welcome to France, sir.Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?Right this way, sir.Patton, haven't seen you
since Messina.How are you?You're doing a splendid job
decoying the Jerries.You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.Best of everything, old boy.By the way......intelligence confirms
that I'm against Rommel again.Rommel.Hi, how are you, George?- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.Well. My, my.Isn't this plush?Looks like you're
bucking for archbishop.Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.Ike wanted me to talk to you
since we can level with each other.That's right.We're making 3rd Army operational
when I take over 12th Army group.Do I get it?I'll be honest with you.I've had reservations.You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.You were the boss in North Africa
and Sicily and I just thought......well, it might be a problem for us.It wouldn't bother me.There's one other thing.We're different kinds of people.Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.With your brains and my screwy ideas,
we make a great team, like in Sicily.Truthfully, if I had been your senior
in Sicily, I would have relieved you.Brad......I'm not crawling on my belly
to get a command.For God's sake, get me in this fight.The only way out of the doghouse
is to do something great.I gotta get back in the war!Hitler's own people tried
to kill him a few days ago.First thing you know,
it'll be over and...I'll......keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.I give you my word.George......I've been working
on a plan called Cobra.I'd like your opinion.We've been slugging through
hedgerow country......half an acre a day
and we've got to find a way out.I want to use this road.The Saint Lï¿½-Periers road.Monty will pin down
the enemy forces at Caen.We'll pulverize an area
31/2 miles wide with bombing.Then seven divisions will follow.The 3rd Army will swing around here, a
sweeping end run right across France.What do you think?I think you'll need a screwball old
cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.George......Ike came to that conclusion
in London three months ago.He what?Why, that dirty-!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.I promise to keep my mouth shut.(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)<font color=""#FFFF00"">What's this activity near Coutances?</font><font color=""#FFFF00"">Enemy armored forces driving

to tell us where he's going.Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?Berlin.I'm going to personally shoot
that paper-hanging son of a bitch.(CHEERING)Hold it. Hold it!This place isn't on the map.You know why?
We've run clear off the map.Give George a headline,
and he's good for another 30 miles.(HONKING)SOLDIER:
Atten-hut!Hold it!Pay attention. We're gonna clean
this mess up right now.Let's move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.Back that thing up there,
and we'll take this one here.All right, get up off your ass.
Let's go now!That's it.
That's the way to move.Good boy. All right, come on.Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
That's it!That's it! Gun it!Gun that thing!Okay, come on.Watch it!Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.That's it.Come on, now.- Chet.
- Yeah, will do.Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.Now come on! Hold it!Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!That's it. Come on.Good boy.- Hold it up there.
- General!General Bradley wants to have
a word with you.Okay. Come on!Okay. Hold it up. Take over.George, you'd make a good traffic cop.George this drive has been
magnificent......but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.- What the hell for?
- We'll have to cut off your supplies.Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Take it easy, George.There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.By God, it is Montgomery.The launching sites for the B-2 bombs
are all in his area.Churchill wants those bases destroyed.Hitler kills more civilians
in London than soldiers.Expect Montgomery to do anything?You give me gasoline and I'll gain
ground with it, kill Germans too.Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.George, I can't do it.The Siegfried line
is an empty shell.They stripped the equipment
and sent it east.It's crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.Why did you pick me to command?I didn't pick you.Ike picked you.George, you have performed
brilliantly.You are loyal, dedicated.You're one of the best I've got,
but you don't know when to shut up.George, you're a pain in the neck.I have a lot of faults, Brad.But ingratitude isn't one of them.I owe you a lot.Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.What I can't stand about Monty is,
he won't admit it.(TANK SPUTTERS)Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.The point tank has run out too.And there's a kraut column up ahead.Yeah, I know.PATTON:
Were you in command here, captain?I was in command.My tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company.Tanks ran out of gas,
so we had to fight it out.We started 11:00 last night.Finished a couple hours ago.This morning the fighting
was hand-to-hand.I had a dream last night.In my dream it came to me......that right now the whole Nazi Reich
is mine for the taking.Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.Now I have precisely
the right instrument......at precisely the right moment of
history and exactly the right place.The Saar?This will change too, very quickly.Like a planet spinning off
into the universe.A moment like this won't come again
for 1000 years.All I need is a few
miserable gallons of gasoline.Right now, the weak spot is here.In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.What about the fortifications
that were done in Metz?Fixed fortifications, huh?Monuments to the stupidity of man.When mountain ranges and oceans
could be overcome......anything built by man
can be overcome.You know how I'm sure
they're finished out there?The carts.They're using carts to move
their wounded and the supplies.The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.Then I remembered......that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.How cold it was.They threw the wounded and what was
left of the supplies in the carts.Napoleon was finished.Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.Only the snow.Look at this, Cod.I love it.God help me, I do love it so.I love it more than my life.NARRATOR: Paris is liberated,
and French troops lead the way.The Allies march into the city
after four years of Nazi occupation.The hard-fighting French
2nd Armored Division......under Major General
Jacques Leclerc......gets an unforgettable welcome......as they enter their beloved Paris.In a powerful drive to the north...... General Montgomery cuts off and
bypasses the French coastal towns......of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.Pushing on to capture the vital
Belgian port of Antwerp.Meanwhile, the main body
of Patton 's army......resupplied now and rolling like a
juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.Nazi resistance appears to crumble.It seems that nothing can stop our
troops from driving on into Germany.- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead
across the Saar.I'm on my way to Germany.Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.I want you to transfer tank armor
to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.Brad, you can't do that.George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.There's a lot of enemy activity
up around Ardennes.No, I don't know how serious it is......but Ike wants us to meet
with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.Be there at 1100.Yes, sir.PATTON: There's absolutely no reason
for us to assume......that the Germans are mounting
a major offense.The weather is awful
and their supplies are low.The Germans haven't mounted a winter
attack since Frederick the Great.Therefore I believe that's exactly
what they're going to do.I want you to start making
contingency plans......for pulling out
of our eastward attack.Changing directions 90 degrees,
moving up to Luxembourg.Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.I want you to plan
for three possible axes of attack.From Diekirch, due north.From Orlï¿½ans to Bastogne.From Neufchï¿½teau against the German
left flank.We've identified four German armies:The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.They've hit us with 26 divisions.They've overran two regimens
of the 106th Division.And 7500 of our men
were forced to surrender.Our concern is that von Rundstedt......has the 101 st Airborne trapped
here at Bastogne.Bastogne, by the way, is the key
to this entire area.If we can hold it, we can break up
the entire German offensive.If they take it,
we're in serious trouble.Ike wants to know if anybody can go......and relieve the 101 st
before they're torn to pieces.There's nothing Montgomery can do.At any rate, not for some weeks.What about you, George?I can attack with three divisions
in 48 hours.I'd give myself some leeway.Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.You're in the middle of a fight now.
It's over a hundred miles to Bastogne.My staff's already working
out the details.Frankly, I don't see how
it's possible.Not in this kind of weather.I should have thought you'd want
to fall back and regroup.Not me. I don't like to pay
for the same real estate twice.TEDDER:
But what about your men?You can't cart them off 100 miles,
expecting them to attack without rest.I trained these men.They'll do what I tell them to do.We hadn't realized you were
so popular with your troops, general.I'm not. They'll do it
because they're good soldiers.And because they realize, as I do,
that we can still lose this war.Then I think I can speak
for Field Marshal Montgomery.He'd say you're asking
the impossible of your men.Of course he would.Cause he's never realized that's
what we're in business for.(BOMB EXPLODES)General McAuliffe refused
a German surrender demand.You know what he said?What?He said, ""Nuts. ""Keep them moving, colonel.A man that eloquent has to be saved.(SILENCE)This is where it pays off.The training and discipline.No other outfit in the world.Pulled out of a winter battle,
move a hundred miles.Going to a major attack with no rest,
no sleep, no hot food.God! God, I'm proud of these men!Sir, von Rundstedt's thrown another
panzer division against Bastogne.101 st Airborne's barely holding on.We need damned air cover. If we had
decent weather, we might make it.CARVER:
General Mason, sir.Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.Cannibalize your antiaircraft units
and turn them into riflemen.Yes, every last one you can find.Good evening, general.I just got the weather report
for tomorrow. More snow.There goes our air cover.We may have to wait
for better weather.Brave men dying up there. I won't
wait, not an hour, not a minute.Going to keep moving.Is that clear?We're going to attack all night
and attack tomorrow morning!If we're not victorious......let no one come back alive.You know something, general?Sometimes, they can't tell when
you're acting and when you're not.It isn't important for them to know.It's only important for me to know.- You want to see me, general?
- Oh, yeah, chaplain.I'm tired of 3rd Army
having to fight Germans......with supreme command,
no gasoline......and now this ungodly weather.I want a prayer, a weather prayer.A weather prayer, sir?Yes, let's see if you can't get God
working with us.Gonna take a thick rug
for that kind of praying.I don't care if it
takes a flying carpet.I don't know how this
will be received, general.Praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man.I assure you, because of
my relations with the Almighty......if you write a good prayer,
we'll have good weather.And I expect that prayer
within an hour.Yes, sir.""Almighty and most merciful Father......we humbly beseech Thee......of Thy great goodness......to restrain this
immoderate weather......with which we've had to contend.Grant us fair weather for battle.Graciously hearken to us......as soldiers who call upon Thee...... that armed with Thy power...... we may advance
from victory to victory......and crush the oppression......and wickedness of our enemies......and establish Thy justice......among men and nations.Amen. ''Weather's perfect.Cod, get me that chaplain.He's in good with the Lord

using former Nazis in key positions.Despite the denazification policy.Well, if I'm supplied
with trained personnel......I'll get rid of the Nazis.Until then, I'll use them to keep
the railroads and telephones working.After all, didn't most
ordinary Nazis join the Party......in about the same way Americans
become Republicans or Democrats?Yes, that's about it.You agree that national policy be made
by civilians, not by the military?Of course. But the politicians
never let us finish.They always stop short and leave us
with another war.You thinking about our Russian allies?Did you say if you found your army
between the Germans and the Russians......you'd attack in both directions?No, I never said that.I never said any such thing.But I wish I had.(LAUGHING)Sir, there's a call on your line from
supreme headquarters, General Smith.Bedell?Ike is furious.How could you compare Republicans
and Democrats to the Nazi Party?And the statement
that you refuse to denazify......has the Russians, the British,
everybody, screaming.Well, the hell
with the Mongoloid Russians.We've given them Berlin, Prague,
God knows what else.They gonna dictate policy too?George, don't be a fool.The war in Europe is over.
Washington dictates policy.The war shouldn't be over. We should
stop pussyfooting about the Russians!We'll have to fight them anyway. Why
not do it now, when the army's here?Instead of disarming Germans let's
get them to help fight the Bolsheviks.You better shut up.
This line may be tapped.I don't care. I'll tell you......we've been fighting
the wrong people.You and I don't have to get involved,
you're so soft about it.Leave it to me. In 10 days
I'll have us at war with them......and make it look like their fault!George, you're mad.
You're absolutely out of your mind!Well, I'm no diplomat.I'm a combat soldier.
That's all they understand.Get Ike to give me the word,
and I'll kick them back to Russia!Shall I call the artist back, sir?Oh, the hell with it.Nobody wants to see a picture of me.
I'm mad!Don't you know that?Field Marshal Montgomery,
his majesty is prepared......to receive the next chief
of the imperial general staff.Thank you.Thank you.Take care of yourself.George.Well, gentlemen......all good things
must come to an end.And the best thing
that's happened to me......in my life......has been......uh......the honor......and privilege......of commanding the 3rd Army.Goodbye......and God bless you.Brad......they've taken the 3rd Army
away from me.I know.I thought we could have dinner
together tonight.Thank you, Brad.That's damn thoughtful.
I appreciate it.Right now, I think I'll take
Willie for a walk.George, look out!After all I've been through......imagine getting killed
by an oxcart.No, Brad, there's only one proper way
for a professional soldier to die.That's from the last bullet
of the last battle of the last war.At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.In our drive across Europe,
we liberated...... 12,000 cities and towns......and inflicted a million and a half
enemy casualties.I sense from now on, just being
a good soldier won't mean a thing.I'm afraid we're gonna have to be
diplomats, administrators, you name it.God help us.George, I want to say one thing.You've done a magnificent job
here in Europe.That's right, George.That soldier you slapped did more to
win the war than any other private.I'll see you for dinner.Six-thirty?PATTON:
For over a thousand years......Roman conquerors
returning from the wars......enjoyed the honor of a triumph,
a tumultuous parade.In the procession came trumpeters
and musicians and strange animals......from the conquered territories...... together with carts laden with
treasure and captured armaments.The conqueror rode
in a triumphal chariot...... the dazed prisoners
walking in chains before him.Sometimes, his children,
robed in white......stood with him in the chariot,
or rode the trace horses.A slave stood behind the conqueror......holding a golden crown......and whispering in his ear
a warning...... that all glory......is fleeting.Subtitles by

-What is it, Mrs Pearce?There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.A young woman?What does she want ?She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.lshould've sent her away ,

to talk into your machine.-Has she an interesting accent
-Simply ghastly, Mr. HigginsGood. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs Pearce.You know, this is rather a bit of luck.
l'll show you how l make recordsWe'll set her talking and then l'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...then in broad Romic, and then
we'll get her on the phonograph...so you can turn her on when you want

l'm come to 'ave lessons, l am .And to pay for 'em too, make no mistake.Well!And what do you expect me to say?Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, l think.Don't l tell you l'm bringin' you business ?Should we ask this baggage to sit down...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?l won't be called a baggage.
Not when l've ofered to pay like any lady.What do you want , my girl?l want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...'stead of sellin' at the corner

for 18 pence an hour...from a real French gentleman.You wouldn't have the face
t' as me the same ...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.So, l won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave itDo you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income ...it works out as fully equivalent of. ..60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.By George, it's enormous
lt's the biggest ofer l ever had .Sixty pound<i>s</i> What are you talkin' about
Where would l get 60 pound<i>s</i>l never ofered you 60 poundsBut l ain't got 60 poundsDon't cry, you silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.Sit down!Anybody'd think you was my father!lf l decide to teach you,
l'll be worse than two fathers to you.Here.What 's this for?To wipe your eyes To wipe any part
of your face that feels moisRemember, that 's your handkerchief
and that 's your sleeve.Don't confuse the one with the other
if you want to become a lady in a shop.lt's no use to talk to her like that ,
Mr. Higgins She doesn 't understand you.'<i>E</i>re! Give the 'ankerchief to me .

and order some new onesJust wrap her in brown paper
till they come .You're no gentleman, you're not,

to this poor girl.l didn't express myself clearly
because l didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...or yoursBut, sir, you can' t take a girl up like that ...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.Why notWhy not But you don't know
anything about her.What about her parents ?
She may be married.Garn!There. As the girl very properly says, garn!Who'd marry me ?By George, <i>E</i>liza ..the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...shooting themselves for your sake
before l've done with you.'<i>E</i>re.l'm goin'.He's of his chump , he is

don't order those new clothes-Throw her out
-Stop, Mr. Higgins l won't allow itGo home to your parents , girl.lain't got no parents .She ain't got no parents .
What 's the fuss aboutNobody wants her. She's no use
to anybody but me . Take her upstairsWhat 's to become of her?
ls she to be paid anything?Oh, do be sensible, sir.What would she do with money?
She'll have food and clothesShe'll only drink if you give her money.You are a brute ! lt's a lie!Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me .Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that !Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feeling<i>s</i>No, l don't think so .
No feelings we need worry aboutWell, have you, <i>E</i>lizal got me feelings same as anyone else .Mr. Higgins, l must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.What 's to become of her
when you've finished your teaching?You must look ahead a little, sir.What 's to become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs Pearce?That 's her own business ,
not yours, Mr. HigginsWhen l'm done we'll throw her back.Then it'll be her own business again.
That 'll be all right, won't itYou've no feelin' 'eart in yaYou don't care for nothin' but yourself.l've 'ad enough of this l'm goin', l am !You ought to be ashamed of yourselfHave some chocolates, <i>E</i>liza'Ow do l know what might be in 'eml've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.Pledge of good faith .l'll take one half.And you take the other.You'll have boxes of them
barrels of them every day .You'll live on them eh?l wouldn't 've ate it, only l'm too laidylike
to take it out o' me mouth .Think of it, <i>E</i>liza
Think of chocolates, and taxis ..and gold and diamondsl don't want no gold and no diamonds
l'm a good girl, l am .Higgins, l really must interfere.
Mrs Pearce is quite rightlf this girl's going to put herself
in your hands for six months ..for an experiment in teaching, she mus
understand thoroughly what she's doing.You are to stay here
for the next six months ..learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.lf you're good and do what you're told,
you shall sleep in a proper bedroom. ..have lots to eat , money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxisBut if you are naughty and idle...you shall sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles ..and be walloped by Mrs Pearce
with a broomstick.At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.lf the King finds out
that you are not a lady...the police will take you to the Tower of
London where your head will be cut of ...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girlsBut if you are not found out
you shall have a present of. ..seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.lf you refuse this ofer...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...and the angels will weep for you!Now are you satisfied, Pickering?l don't understand
what you are talking aboutCould l put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs Pearce?Come with me .That 's right
Bundle her of to the bathroom.You're a great bully, you are!l won't stay here if l don't like it
l won't let nobody wallop me !Don't answer back, girl.l've always been a good girl, l 'ave.ln six months- - ln three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...l'll take her anywhere
and l'll pass her of as anything.l'll make a queen
of that barbarous wretch!l've never had a bath in me life .
Not what you'd call a proper one.You know you can' t be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.l'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.Oh, l couldn't sleep in here, Missuslt's too good for the likes o' me .lshould be afraid to touch anythin'.lain't a duchess yet, you know.What 's thi<i>s</i>

This is no trifling matter.Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?Yes, very frequently.l haven't l find that the moment
l let a woman make friends with me ...she becomes jealous, exacting...suspicious and a damned nuisance.lfind the moment that l make friends with

-Here!Where?Good morning, Governor.l come about a very serious matter,
Governor.Brought up in Houndslow.Mother Welsh , l should think.What is it you want , Doolittle?l want my daughter, that 's what l want .
See?Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?l'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left .She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.What ?Take her away . Do you think l am going
to keep your daughter for you?Now, is this reasonable, Governor?ls it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that ?The girl belongs to me . You got 'er.
Where do l come in?How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me !You sent her here on purpose !Don't take a man up like that , Governor.The police shall take you up.
This is a pla ..a plot to extort money by threatslshall telephone the police.Have l asked you for a brass farthin'?l leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have l said a word about money?Well, what else did you come for?What would a bloke come for?Be 'uman, Governor.Alfred, you sent her here on purpose .So help me , Governor, l never did.Then how did you know she was here?l'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd only let me get a word in.l'm willing to tell ya
l'm wanting to tell yal'm waiting to tell yaYou know, Pickering, this chap 's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.''l'm willing to tell you. l'm wanting
to tell you. l'm waiting to tell you.''That 's the Welsh strain in 'im.How did you know <i>E</i>liza was here
if you didn't send 'er?Well, she sent back for her luggage
and l got to 'ear about itShe said she didn't want no clothesWhat was l to think from that , Governor?
lask you, as a parent, what was l to think?So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?-Yes, sir, Governor. That 's right
-YesMrs Pearce!<i>E</i>liza' s father has come to take her away .
Give her to him will you?Now wait a minute , Governor.
Wait a minute .You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs Pearce.lthink so indeed, sir!Here, Governor.l've took a sort of a fancy to you and ...if you want the girl, l ain't so set
on 'avin' her back home again...but what l might be open to
is an arrangementAll l ask is my rights as a father.You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.l can see you're o' the straight sort,
Governor.So...what 's a five pound note to you?
An' what 's <i>E</i>liza to me ?lthink you ought to know, Doolittle...that Mr. Higgins' intentions are
entirely honorable.Of course they are, Governor.
lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.Do you mean to say you'd sell
your daughter for 50 pound<i>s</i>Have you no morals, man?No, l can' t afford 'em Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me .Not that l mean any 'arm mind ya, but ..if <i>E</i>liza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me , too?Why notWell, look....Look at it my way . What am l?lask ya, what am l? l'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that 's what l am .Now think what that means to a man.lt means he's up agains
middle-class morality for all the time .lf there's anything goin' an' l puts in
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:''You're undeservin', so you can' t have it ''But my needs is as great as the mos
deservin' widows that ever got money...out of six diferent charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband .l don't need less than a deservin' man,
l need more.l don't eat less 'earty than he does
and l drink...a lot more.l'm playin' straight with you.lain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, l'm undeservin'...And I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that 's the truth.But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?And I leave it to you.You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales- We'd better give 'im a fiver.
- He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won'tJust one good spree
for meself an' the missus...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to othersAn' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.You couldn't spend it better.Oh, this is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten, Governor.Ten pounds is a lot o' money.Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality, Doolittle.Why don't you marry
that missus of <i>yours</i>After all, marriage isn 't so frightening.
You married Eliza' s mother.Who told you that, Governor?Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally...If we listen to this man for another minute
we shall have no convictions left.- Five pounds, I think you said.
- Thank you, Governor.Are you sure you won't have ten?No. No, perhaps another time.I beg your pardon, Miss.I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.Blimey, it's ElizaWell, I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.She does me credit, don't she, Governor?Here! What are you doin' here?Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.That 's the way to improve 'er mind.Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, ElizaThere's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...a common dustman, one o'

I knew 'em before I come.If you know them say them.Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.A, <i>E,</i> I, O, U.That 's what I said. Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.That 's what I been sayin' for three days
an'I won't say 'em no more.I know it's dificult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.There's no use explaining.
As a military man you ought to know that.Drilling is what she needsLeave her alone or she'll be turning to you
for sympathy.Very well, if you insis

Ithink the time has come to try her outAre you feeling all right, Mr. <i>Higgins</i>Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?- Very well, thank you.
- Good.Let's test her in public
and see how she faresMr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.Do you know what it might have been?I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?If this goes on, Mrs Pearce,
you'd better see a doctor.- I know. We'll take her to the races
- The <i>races</i>My mother's box at Ascot- You'll consult your mother firs
- Yes, of course.No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.First thing in the morning,
we'll go out and buy her a dress.Now get on with your work, ElizaBut, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.What better time to work
than early in the morning?Where does one buy a lady's gown?Whitely's, of course.How do you know that?Common knowledge.Let's not buy her anything too flowery.I despise those gowns
with, sort of weeds here and weeds there.We'll buy something
sort of simple and modes...and elegant. That 's what 's called for.Perhaps with a bow.Yes That 's just rightYou've all been working much too hard.
Ithink the strain is beginning to show.<i>Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins saysYou must put down your books

She's a flower girl.I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out firs- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you know the Embassy Ball.So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?Common flower girl?Itaught her how to speak properly.She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.She's to keep to two subjects:
The weather and everybody's health.""Fine day!"" and ""How do you do?""
Not just let herself go on things in general.Help her along, darling.
You'll be quite safe.Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?Well, she's got to talk about something.Where is the girl now?She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't quite fit.Itold Pickering we should have
taken her with us- Mrs Eynsford-Hill.
- Good afternoon, Mrs HigginsYou know my son, Henry.How do you do?- I've seen you somewhere before.
- I don't know.It doesn 't matter. You better sit down.Where the devil can they be?Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for teaThank you, Mrs Higgins

Miss Doolittle.I'm so sorry that you missed itWill it rain, do you think?The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.How awfully funny.What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it rightSmashing.Has it suddenly turned chilly?I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spellsThey bring on so much influenzaAnd the whole of our family
is susceptible to itMy aunt died of influenza, so they said.But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.Done her in?Yes, Lord love you.Why should she die of influenza...when she come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.Fairly blue with it she was.They all thought she was dead.But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl of the spoon.Dear me!Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...have to die of influenzaAnd what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?Somebody pinched itAnd what I say isThem 'as pinched it, done her in.Done her in? Done her in, did you say?Whatever does it meaOh, that 's the new small talk.
""To do somebody in"" means to kill them.But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?Do I notThem she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.But it can' t have been right
for your father...to pour spirits down her throat like that.It might have killed her.Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of itDo you mean that he drank?Drank? My word. Something chronic.Here, what are you sniggering at?The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?Have I said anything I oughtn 'tNot at all, my dear.Well, that 's a mercy anyhow.I don't know if there's enough time
before the next race to place a bet...but come, my dear.I have a bet on number seven.
Ishould be so happy if you would take itYou'll enjoy the race ever so much more.That 's very kind of you.His name is Dover.Come along, Eliza<i>There they are again</i><i>Lining up to run</i><i>Now they're holding steady</i><i>They are ready for it, look</i><i>It has begun</i>Come on. Come on, Dover.Come on.Come on, Dover!Come on!Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' assOh, my dear.You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.Don't you think she's ready for itDear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.Her language may need
a little refining, but- -Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...then you must be
absolutely potty about her.Ladvise you to give it up
and not put yourself...or this poor girl through any more.Why, it's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night It fills our whole livesTeaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing ElizaYou're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.Here's the car.Good evening, sir.- Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
- Immediately, sir.Good evening, Professor Higgins<i>When she mentioned</i>
<i>How her aunt bit off the spoon</i><i>She completely done me in</i><i>And my heart went on</i>
<i>A journey to the moon</i><i>When she told about her father</i>
<i>And the gin</i><i>And I never saw</i>
<i>A more enchanting farce</i><i>Than the moment when she shouted</i>
<i>""Move your bloomin""...</i>- Yes, sir?
- Is Miss Doolittle in?Whom shall I say is calling?Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn 't remember who I am...tell her I'm the chap
who was sniggering at her.Yes, sir.And will you give her these?Wouldn't you like to come in, sir?They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives<i>I have often walked</i>
<i>Down this street before</i><i>But the pavement always stayed</i>
<i>Beneath my feet before</i><i>All at once am I
<i>Several stories high</i><i>Knowing I'm on the street</i>
<i>Where you live</i><i>Are there lilac trees</i>
<i>In the heart of town?</i><i>Can you hear a lark</i>
<i>In any other part of town?</i><i>Does enchantment pour</i>
<i>Out of every door?</i><i>No, it's just on the street</i>
<i>Where you live</i><i>And, oh, the towering feeling</i><i>Just to know</i>
<i>Somehow you are near</i><i>The overpowering feeling</i><i>That any second</i>
<i>You may suddenly appear</i><i>People stop and stare</i>
<i>They don't bother me</i><i>For there's nowhere else on Earth</i>
<i>That I would rather be</i><i>Let the time go by</i><i>I won't care if I<i>Can be here on the street</i>
<i>Where you live</i>I'm terribly sorry, sir.Miss Doolittle says she doesn 't want
to see anyone ever again.But why? She was unbelievable.So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?Tell her that I'll waitOh, but it might be days, sir, even weeksBut don't you see? I'll be happier here.<i>People stop and stare</i>
<i>They don't bother me</i><i>For there's nowhere else on Earth</i>
<i>That I would rather be</i><i>Let the time go by</i><i>I won't care if I<i>Can be here on the street</i>
<i>Where you live</i>It really is, Higgins
It's inhuman to continue.Do you realize what you've got to try
and teach this poor girl in six <i>weeks</i>You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call of the betI know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.This experiment is over.And nothing short of an order
from the King could force me to recant.You understand, <i>Higgins</i> It's over.Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...if Miss Doolittle sufers
any embarrassment whatever...it'll be on your head alone.<i>Eliza can do anything.Suppose she's discovered?
Remember AscotSuppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.Think of how agonizing it would be.If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.You could always rejoin your regimentThis is no time for flippancy, HigginsThe way you've driven her
the last six weeks...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.For God's sake, stop pacing up and down.
Can' t you settle somewhere?Have some port lt'll quieten your nervesI'm not nervous- Where is it
- On the piano.The car 's here, sir.Good. Tell Miss Doolittle, will you?Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn 't fit.I warned you
about these French designersWe should have gone to <i>an</i> English shop.
They would've been on our side.- Have a glass of port
- No, thank you.Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?Well, we shall see.Suppose she doesn 'tI lose my betThere's one thing I can' t stand about you,
that 's your confounded complacency.At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of portAnd what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn 't matter at all.Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she mattersWhat do you think I've been doing
all these <i>months</i>What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...and change her into a diferent human
being by creating a new speech for her?It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...and soul from soul.Oh, she matters immensely.Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.Thank you, Colonel Pickering.Don't you think so, <i>Higgins</i>Not bad. Not bad at all.Maestro! Maestro!Don't you remember me?No. Who the devil are you?I'm your pupil.
Your firs your greates your best pupil.I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.Imade your name famous
throughout Europe.You teach me phonetics
You cannot forget me.Why don't you have your hair cutI don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.Where did you get all of these old <i>coins</i>These are decorations for languagesThe Queen of Transylvania is here
this evening.I'm indispensable to her
at these oficial international partiesIspeak 32 languages
I know everyone in Europe.No imposter can escape my detection.Professor Karpathy.The Greek ambassador.Greek, my footHe pretends not to know any English,
but he cannot deceive me.He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...without betraying his origin.I help him pretend, but I make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.<i>Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs

absolutely superb.Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?Not during the whole evening?Not when I saw we were going to win.Lfelt like a bear in a cage hanging aboutIt was an immense achievementIf I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given it up two months ago.Absolutely fantastic.Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.Higgins, I salute you.The silly people don't know
their own silly business.<i>Tonight, old man, you did it</i>
<i>You did it, you did it</i><i>You said that you would do it</i>
<i>And indeed you did</i><i>I thought that you would rue it</i>

<i>And let him dance with her</i><i>Oozing charm from every pore</i>
<i>He oiled his way around the floor</i><i>Every trick that he could play</i>
<i>He used to strip her mask away</i><i>And when at last the dance was done</i>
<i>He glowed as if he knew he'd won</i><i>And with a voice too eager</i>
<i>And a smile too broad</i><i>He announced to the hostess</i>
<i>That she was a fraud</i>No!<i>""Her English is too good,""he said</i>

- Good night, Mrs Pearce.Ithink I'll turn in, too. Good night, Higgins
It's been a great occasion.Good night, Pickering.Mrs Pearce?Damn, I meant to ask her to give me
cofee in the morning instead of teaLeave a little note for her will you, Eliza
And put out the lights.Must be downstairs Oh, darn itI'll leave my head behind
one of these daysWhat the devil have I done
with my <i>slippers</i>Here are your slippersTake your slippers and may you never
have a day 's luck with them.What on Earth? What 's the matter?Is anything wrong?No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?That 's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?You won my bet
You presumptuous insect I won itWhy did you throw those slippers at me?Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up, the gutter?You thank God it's all over. Now you ca
throw me back again! Do you?Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?Sit down and be quietOh, what 's to become of me?
What 's to become of me?How the devil do I know
what 's to become of you?What does it matter?You don't care. I know you don't care.You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.Not as much as them slippersThose slippersThose slippers I didn't think it meant
any diference now.Why have you suddenly begun
going on like <i>this</i>May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs Pearce?Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?Well, I'm glad to hear that.Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.Would you have a chocolate?No, thank you.Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.Nothing more to worry aboutNo, nothing more for you to worry aboutOh, God, I wish I was dead.Why? In heaven's name, why?Now listen to me, Eliza
All this irritation is purely subjective.I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.Go to bed and sleep it of.Have a little cry and say your prayers
You'll feel very much more comfortable.I heard your prayers""Thank God it's all over.""Don't you thank God it's all over?Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?Where am I to go? What am I to do?And what 's to become of me?Oh, that 's what 's worrying you, is itI wouldn't worry about that if I were you.I'm sure you won't have any dificulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.I didn't quite realize you were going away.You might marry, you know.You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devilsYou're not bad -Iooking.You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimesNot now, when you've been crying.You look like the very devil, but...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.Go to bed, have a good night's res
get up in the morning...and have a look at yourself in the glass
You won't feel so bad.I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.We were above that in Covent Garden.What do you meaIsold flowers, I didn't sell myself.Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.Oh, tosh, Eliza
Don't insult human relations...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into itDon't marry the fellow
if you don't want to.What else am I to do?Oh, there are lots of thingsWhat about the old idea of a florist shop?I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.He'll pay for all those togs
you're wearing.And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 poundsOh, come on now. You'll be all rightWell, I must be of to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.I was looking for something. What was itYour slippersOh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.Before you go, sir.Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?Why bother about that
in the middle of the nightWhat may I take away with me?I don't want to be accused of stealing.Stealing?You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.I'm sorry. I'm only a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.There can' t be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn 'tTake the whole damned houseful
if you want.<i>Except the jewelry. That 's hired.
Will that satisfy you?Stop, please.Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?I don't want to run the ris
of them being missed.Oh, hand them over! If these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...I'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.The ring isn 't the jeweler's
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.I don't want it now.Don't you hit me!Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heartI'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.You've caused me to lose my temper.
That 's hardly happened to me before.I don't wish to discuss it further tonight
I'm going to bed.Leave your own note for Mrs Pearce
about the cofee...for it won't be done by me!Damn Mrs Pearce,
damn the cofee and damn you!Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!<i>Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins</i>

You can tell him that straightWhat are you talking about
What are you dressed up for?As if you didn't know.Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.What 's he done to you?Ruined me, that 's all.Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.And don't you defend him.Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to a
old American blighter named Wallingford...who was giving five millions
to found Moral Reform societies...to tell him the most original moralis
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...a common dustmaSounds like one of his jokes.You may call it a j
It's put the lid on me. Proper.The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.Itouched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the 'ot of them.Oh, I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.Come on, Alfile, in a couple of hours
we have to be at the church.- Church?
- Yeah, church.The deepest cut of all.Why do you think I'm dressed up

she wants to be respectable.If that 's the way you feel about it,
why don't you give the money back?That 's the tragedy of it, ElizaIt's easy to say chuck it...but I 'aven't the nerve.We're all intimidated.
That 's what we are, intimidated.Bought up. Yeah. That 's what I am.That 's what your precious professor's
brought me to.Not my precious professor.Oh, sent you back, 'as he?First he shoves me in the middle-class,

without telling me a thing about itWhat am I to do?
I got tea this morning instead of cofee.I don't know where anything is,
what my appointments are.- Eliza' d know.
- Damn it, she's gone!Did either of you gentlemen
frighten her last nightWe hardly said a word to her.
You were there.Did you bully her after I went to bed?She threw the slippers at me.I never gave her the slightest provocation.The slippers came bang at my head
before I uttered a word.She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand itWe always gave her every consideration.
She admitted itI'm dashed!Oh, Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!Phone the police.
What are they there for in heaven's name?You can' t give Eliza' s name to the police...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrellaBut why not I want to find the girl.She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.Quite right Hello. Scotland Yard, please?Get me some cofee, would you please?Scotland Yard?I beg your pardon, yes This is,
this is Colonel Pickering speaking.27 A Wimpole StreetI want to report a missing person.Miss Eliza Doolittle.About 21.Oh, I should say about 5 foot 7.Her <i>eyes</i> Let me think now.
Her eyes Her eyes- -- Brown.
- Brown.Her hair? Oh, good Lord.
Well, sort of nondescript neutral sort of- -Brown, brown, brown!You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yesNo, no, no. This is her residence. 27 A...Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00
this morning, I understand.No, no, no...
No, she's no relation, no.Well, just let's call her a good friend,
shall we?I beg your pardon?Listen to me, my man,
I don't like the tenor of that question.What the girl does here is our affair.Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing itWell, I'm dashed!<i>What in all, in heaven</i>
<i>Could have prompted her to go?</i><i>After such a triumph at the ball</i><i>What could have depressed her?</i><i>What could have possessed her?</i>
<i>I cannot understand the wretch at all</i>Higgins, I have an old school chum
at the Home Ofice. Perhaps he could help.Think I'll give him a ring.Whitehall: 7244, please.<i>Women are irrational</i>

Nice to hear your voice.What? You don't say.
Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?Quite right Yes, oceans of water.Listen, Bruzzie,
I'll tell you why I rang up.Something rather unpleasant happened
at this end. Could I come and see you?Well, I could, yes Now, straight away?Right Good. Thank you.Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.Mrs Pearce, I'm going along
to the Home Ofice.I do hope you find her,
Colonel Pickering.Mr. Higgins will miss her.Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!- Mrs Pearce?
- Yes, sir.Where's the Colonel?He's gone to the Home Ofice, sir.There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs
for help. Now there's a good fellow.Mrs Pearce, you're a woman.<i>Why can't a woman be more like a man?</i><i>Men are so decent</i>
<i>Such regular chaps</i><i>Ready to help you</i>
<i>Through any mishaps</i><i>Ready to buck you up</i>
<i>Whenever you are glum</i><i>Why can't a woman be a chum?</i><i>Why is thinking</i>
<i>Something women never do?</i><i>And why is logic never even tried?</i><i>Straightening up their hair</i>
<i>Is all they ever do</i><i>Why don't they straighten up</i>
<i>The mess that's inside?</i><i>Why can't a woman behave like a man?</i><i>If I was a woman</i>
<i>Who'd been to a ball</i><i>Been hailed as a princess</i>
<i>By one and by all</i><i>Would I start weeping</i>
<i>Like a bathtub overflowing?</i><i>Or carry on as if my home</i>
<i>Were in a tree?</i><i>Would I run off</i>
<i>And never tell me where I'm going?</i><i>Why can't a woman be like me?</i>You mean that after you'd done
this wonderful thing for them...without making a mistake...they just sat there
and never said a word?Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?Not a word.They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...and what a bore it had all been.This is simply appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.Ishould have thrown the fire ironsWho's that?Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.Now, remember...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.Mother, the most confounded thing...
Do you...You!Good afternoon, Professor Higgins
Are you quite well?Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some teaDon't you dare try that game on me.
Itaught it to you.Get up, come home and stop being a fool.You've caused me enough trouble.Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.How did this baggage get here?<i>Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.If you don't promise to behave yourself
lmust as you to leave.You mean, I'm to put on
my Sunday manners for this...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?That 's precisely what I meaHowever did you learn good manners
with my son around?It was very dificult I should never have
known how ladies...and gentlemen behave
if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.You see, Mrs Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...the diference between a lady
and a flower girl isn 't how she behaves...but how she is treated.Ishall always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.I know I'll always be a lady
to Colonel Pickering...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.Henry, don't grind your teeth.The bishop is here, Madam.
Shall I show him into the garden?The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!Ishould be excommunicated.I'll see him in the library.<i>Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...I give you full permission
to have him evicted.Henry dear, I suggest you stick to
two subjects: The weather and your health.You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.Have you had enough and are you going to
be reasonable or do you want any more?You want me back to pick up
your slippers...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.I didn't say I wanted you back at all.Indeed? Then what are we talking aboutWell, about you, not about me.If you come back you'll be treated
as you've always been.I can' t change my nature or my mannersMy manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering'sThat 's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.And I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.Oh, I see. The same to everybody.You see, the great secret
is not a question of good manners...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manners...but having the same manner
for all human soulsThe question is not
whether I treat you rudely...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.I don't care how you treat me.I don't mind your swearing at me.
Ishouldn't mind a black eye.I've had one before this
But I won't be passed over!Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.You talk about me as though
I was a motorbusSo you are a motorbus All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can' tI know you ca I told you, you could.You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...whether I could get along without you?Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.So I can, without you or any soul on Earth.Ishall miss you, Eliza I've learned
something from your idiotic notionsI confess that humbly and gratefully.Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.When you feel lonely without me you ca
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurtWell, I can' t turn your soul on.Oh, you are a devil!You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.What am I to come back for?For the fun of it That 's why I took you on.You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.Yes And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.And live with my father?Yes, or sell flowers
Would you rather marry Pickering?I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he isI'll talk as I like.
You're not my teacher now.That 's not what I want
and don't you think it isI've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that itNo, I don't That 's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.I want a little kindness.I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...but I'm not dirt under your feetWhat I done... what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to... came...to care for you.Not to want you to make love to me...and not forgetting the diference
between us, but...more friendly like.Well, of course. That 's how I feel.And how Pickering feels
<i>Eliza, you're a fool!That 's not the proper answer.It's the only answer
till you stop being a idiotIf you want to be a lady,
you must stop feeling neglected...if the men don't spend
half their time sniveling over you...and the other half giving you black eyesYou find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?Of with you to the sort of people you like.Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.If you can' t appreciate what you've got,
you'd better get what you can appreciate.I can' t talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.I'm always in the wrong.Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...to be trampled on and talked down.I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.That poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...even if he had the guts to try for itWoman, don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.I'll go and be a teacher.What 'll you teach, in heaven's name?What you taught me. I'll teach phoneticsI'll ofer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant HungariaWhat, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying <i>ignoramus</i>Teach him my methods, my <i>discoveries</i>You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.That 's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.Now, I don't care for your bullyin'

You shall not be seeing me again.Mother!Mother!What is it, Henry? What 's happened?She's gone.Well, of course, dear.
What did you expectWhat am I to do?Do without, I suppose.And so I shall.If the Higgins' oxygen burns up
her little lungs...let her seek some stufiness
that suits her.She's an owl sickened
by a few days of my sunshine.Let her go. I can do without her.I can do without anyone.

A merry hunt you've led us on...and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!We are sitting on a field of victory...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.The salted pork is particularly good.Salted pork?- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...who's taken over management of Isengard.Young Master Gandalf.I'm glad you've come.Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.But there is a wizard to manage here...locked in his tower.Show yourself.Be careful.Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.No.We need him alive.We need him to talk.You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...and made peace afterwards.Can we not take counsel together

the sport of your own crows...we shall have peace.Gibbets and crows?Dotard!What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!Your treachery has already cost many lives.Thousands more are now at risk.But you could save them, Saruman.You were deep in the enemy's counsel.So you have come here for information.I have some for you.Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.Something that you have failed to see.But the Great Eye has seen it.Even now he presses his advantage.His attack will come soon.You're all going to die.But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...those he professes to love.Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...before you sent him to his doom?The path that you have set

belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.You are a lesser son of greater sires.Grima...come down.Be free of him.- Free? He will never be free.
- No.Get down, cur!Saruman!You were deep in the enemy's counsel.Tell us what you know!You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.I will not be held prisoner here.Send word to all our allies...and to every corner of

And then?Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...until we come to the tunnel.And when they go in...there's no coming out.She's always hungry.She always needs to feed.She must eat.All she gets is filthy Orcses.And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?No.Not very nice at all, my love.She hungers for sweeter meats.Hobbit meat.And when she throws away the

I know.Trust me.Come, Smeagol.What time is it?Not yet dawn.I dreamed I saw a great wave...climbing over green lands and above the hills.I stood upon the brink.It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.A light shone behind me...but I could not turn.I could only stand there, waiting.Night changes many thoughts.Sleep, Eowyn.Sleep...while you can.The stars are veiled.Something stirs in the east.A sleepless malice.The Eye of the enemy is moving.What are you doing?Pippin!Pippin?Pippin.- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.Just one more time.Put it back.Pippin.No!Pippin.He is here.I see you.Pippin!Help! Gandalf, help!Someone help him!Pippin!Fool of a Took!Look at me.Gandalf, forgive me.Look at me.What did you see?A tree.There was a white tree...in a courtyard of stone.It was dead.The city was burning.Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?I saw...I saw him.I could hear his voice in my head.And what did you tell him?Speak!He asked me my name. I didn't answer.He hurt me.What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.A fool...but an honest fool he remains.He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.We've been strangely fortunate.Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.Men are not as weak as he supposed.There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.Sauron fears this.He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.Tell me...why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?What do we owe Gondor?- I will go.
- No!- They must be warned.
- They will be.You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.Follow the river. Look to the black ships.Understand this:Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.I ride for Minas Tirith...and I won't be going alone.Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.Hurry! Hurry!Where are we going?Why did you look?Why do you always have to look?- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.I'm sorry, all right?- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?The enemy thinks you have the Ring.He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.And you...? You're coming with me?Merry?Come on.How far is Minas Tirith?Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.Here.Something for the road.The last of the Longbottom Leaf.I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.But... But we'll see each other soon.- Won't we?
- I don't know.I don't know what's going to happen.- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.Show us the meaning of haste.Merry!Merry!He's always followed me...everywhere I went...since before we were tweens.I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...but I was always there to get him out.Now he's gone.Just like Frodo and Sam.One thing I have learned about Hobbits:They're a most hardy folk.Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.Take her by the safest road.A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.It waits to carry her across the sea.The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.There is nothing for you here...only death.Lady Arwen...we cannot delay.My lady!- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.You have the gift of foresight.What did you see?I looked into your future, and I saw death.But there is also life.You saw there was a child. You saw my son.That future is almost gone.But it is not lost.Nothing is certain.Some things are certain.If I leave him now...I will regret it forever.It is time.From the ashes a fire shall be wokenA light from the shadow shall springRenewed shall be blade that was brokenThe crownless again shall be kingRe-forge the sword.Your hands are cold.The life of the Eldar is leaving you.This was my choice.Whether by your will or not...there is no ship now that can bear me hence.We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.Minas Tirith.City of kings.Make way!It's the tree.Gandalf. Gandalf.Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.The tree of the king.Lord Denethor, however, is not king.He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.And say nothing of Aragorn either.In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.Perhaps you come to explain this.Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.Boromir died to save us...my kinsman and me.- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.I offer you my service, such as it is...in payment of this debt.This is my first command to you.How did you escape and my son did not...so mighty a man as he was?The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...and Boromir was pierced by many.Get up.My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...but it is not now.War is coming.The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.You think you are wise, Mithrandir.Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?I have seen more than you know.With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.Come.All has turned to vain ambition.He would even use his grief as a cloak.A thousand years this city has stood.Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.And the White Tree, the tree of the king...will never bloom again.- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...before it fell into decay.The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...and counted the old names of their descent...dearer than the names of their sons.Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.The line of kings failed.The White Tree withered.The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.Mordor.Yes, there it lies.This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.A storm is coming.This is not the weather of the world.This is a device of Sauron's making.A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...so he covers the face of the sun...to ease their passage along the road to war.When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...it will begin.Well...Minas Tirith...very impressive.- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.There's no leaving this city.Help must come to us.It must be getting near teatime.Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.We're not in decent places.Mr. Frodo?What is it?It's just a feeling.I don't think I'll be coming back.Yes, you will. Of course you will.That's just morbid thinking.We're going there and back again...just like Mr. Bilbo.You'll see.I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.Long ago, when there was a king.Mr. Frodo, look.The king has got a crown again.Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.Ridiculous Hobbit.Guard of the Citadel.Thank you.There's no more stars.Is it time?Yes.It's so quiet.It's the deep breath before the plunge.I don't want to be in a battle...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?There never was much hope.Just a fool's hope.Our enemy is ready.His full strength's gathered.Not only Orcs, but Men as well.Legions of Haradrim from the south...mercenaries from the coast.All will answer Mordor's call.Come on.This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...the last defense of this city will be gone.But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.Gandalf?Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.The one they say no living man can kill.The Witch King of Angmar.You've met him before.He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.He is the lord of the Nazgul...the greatest of the Nine.Minas Morgul is his lair.The Dead City.Very nasty place. Full of enemies.Quick. Quick.They will see. They will see.Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.The way into Mordor.The secret stair.Climb.- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!- What's it doing?
- No.- They're calling me.
- No.Hide! Hide!I can feel his blade.We come to it at last.The great battle of our time.Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.The board is set.The pieces are moving.Up, up, up the stairs we go.And then it's into the tunnel.Hey, what's in this tunnel?You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.One sniff something's not right...one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.No more slinker. No more stinker.You're gone. Got it?I'm watching you.What was that about?Nothing. Just clearing something up.Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.You must not fail me.It's been very quiet across the river.The Orcs are lying low.The garrison may have moved out.We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.Quiet.We need 10 more.Kill him!They're not coming from the north.To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.Faster.Draw swords.Hold! Hold them!What?Amon DinThe beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.Hope is kindled.The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!Gondor calls for aid.And Rohan will answer.Muster the Rohirrim.Assemble the army at Dunharrow.As many men as can be found. You have two days.On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.- Forward.
- Very good, sir.- Gamling.
- My lord.Make haste across the Riddermark.Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.I will.- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.The men have found their captain.They will follow you into battle, even to death.You have given us hope.Excuse me.I have a sword.Please accept it.I offer you my service, Theoden King.And gladly I accept it.You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.Horse-Men.I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.I fear war already marches on their own lands.So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...the doom of our time will be decided.Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!Faramir!We can't hold them. The city is lost.Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.Nazgul.Take cover!Nazgul!Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!Fall back!- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!The age of Men is over.The time of the Orc has come.- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.Take cover, my lord!It's coming!- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!Pull!Mithrandir.They broke through our defenses.They've taken the bridge and the west bank.- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.Faramir?This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.No.You've seen Frodo and Sam?- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.Not two days ago.Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.What does that mean?- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.Tell me all you know.This is how you would serve your city?You would risk its utter ruin?I did what I judged to be right.What you judged to be right.You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.Hidden.Dark and deep in the vaults...not to be used.Unless at the uttermost end of need.I would not use the Ring.Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...as a king of old.Boromir would have remembered his father's need.He would have brought me a kingly gift.Boromir would not have brought the Ring.He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.And when he returned...you would not have known your son.Boromir was loyal to me!Not some wizard's pupil!Father?My son.Leave me.Careful, master. Careful.Very far to fall.Very dangerous are the stairs.Come, master.Come to Smeagol.Mr. Frodo.Get back, you!Don't touch him!Why does he hates poor Smeagol?What has Smeagol ever done to him?Master?Master carries heavy burden.Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.Fat one cannot know.Smeagol look after master.He wants it.He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.The fat one will take it from you.Send forth all legions.Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.Slay them all.- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.Where are Theoden's riders?Will Rohan's army come?Mithrandir.Courage is the best defense that you have now.What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?It was well-done.A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.You are to join the tower guard.I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.Once belonged to a young boy of the city.A very foolish one...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.My father had it made for me.Well...I'm taller than you were then.Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.Never fitted me either.Boromir was always the soldier.They were so alike, he and my father.Proud.Stubborn even.But strong.I think you have strength of a different kind.And one day your father will see it.Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...in peace or war...in living or dying...from...From this hour henceforth...until my lord release me...or death take me.And I shall not forget it...nor fail to reward that which is given.Fealty with love.Valor with honor.Disloyalty with vengeance.I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...defenses that your brother long held intact.- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...the river in Pelennor unfought.Osgiliath must be retaken.My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.Much must be risked in war.Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?You wish now that our places had been exchanged...that I had died and Boromir had lived.Yes.I wish that.Since you were robbed of Boromir...I will do what I can in his stead.If I should return, think better of me, Father.That will depend on the manner of your return.What are you up to?Sneaking off, are we?Sneaking?Sneaking?Fat Hobbit is always so polite.Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...and they say ""sneak.""Sneak?Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!You just startled me is all.What were you doing?Sneaking.Fine. Have it your own way.I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.We have to be moving on.It's dark still.It's always dark here.It's gone!- The Elven bread.
- What?That's all we have left.He took it. He must have!Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!He doesn't eat it.- He can't have taken it.
- Look.What's this?Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!He took it.I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.That's a filthy lie!You stinking, two-faced sneak!- Sam!
- Call me...Stop it!Sam!- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.- I'm all right.
- No.No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.It's that Gollum.It's this place.It's that thing around your neck.I could help a bit.I could carry it for a while.Carry it for a while.I could carry it... I could carry it.Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.Get away!I don't want to keep it.I just want to help.See? See?He wants it for himself.Shut up, you!Go away! Get out of here!No, Sam.It's you.I'm sorry, Sam.But he's a liar.He's poisoned you against me.You can't help me anymore.You don't mean that.Go home.Faramir!Faramir!Your father's will has turned to madness.Do not throw away your life so rashly.Where does my allegiance lie if not here?This is the city of the Men of Numenor.I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...her memory, her wisdom.Your father loves you, Faramir.He will remember it before the end.Can you sing, Master Hobbit?Well...yes.At least, well enough for my own people.But we have no songs for great halls...and evil times.And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?Come, sing me a song.Home is behindThe world aheadAnd there are many paths to treadThrough shadowTo the edge of nightUntil the stars are all alightMist and shadowCloud and shadeAll shall fadeAll shallFadeMarch! March!March! March! March!Make way for the king.Make way.The king is here.My lord.Hail to you, sire.Grimbold, how many?I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.Six thousand spears.Less than half of what I'd hoped for.Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.More will come.Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.We have till dawn, then we must ride.The horses are restless...and the men are quiet.They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.That road there...where does that lead?It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.None who venture there ever return.That mountain is evil.Aragorn.Let's find some food.There.A true esquire of Rohan.I'm ready.Sorry.It isn't all that dangerous.It's not even sharp.Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.Come on.To the smithy. Go!You should not encourage him.You should not doubt him.I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.Why should Merry be left behind?He has as much cause to go to war as you.Why can he not fight for those he loves?You know as little of war as that Hobbit.When the fear takes him...and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...do you think he would stand and fight?He would flee.And he would be right to do so.War is the province of Men, Eowyn.I choose a mortal life.I wish I could've seen him...one last time.Sir?King Theoden awaits you, my lord.I take my leave.My lord Elrond.I come on behalf of one whom I love.Arwen is dying.She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.The light of the Evenstar is failing.As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.The end has come.It will not be our end, but his.You ride to war, but not to victory.Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.They'll be in the city in two days.You're outnumbered, Aragorn.You need more men.There are none.There are those who dwell in the mountain.Murderers...traitors.You would call upon them to fight?They believe in nothing.They answer to no one.They will answer to the king of Gondor.Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.The man who can wield the power of this sword...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.Put aside the Ranger.Become who you were born to be.Take the Dimholt road.I give hope to Men.I keep none for myself.Why are you doing this?The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.You cannot abandon the men.Eowyn...We need you here.Why have you come?Do you not know?It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.I cannot give you what you seek.I have wished you joy since first I saw you.Just where do you think you're off to?Not this time.This time you must stay, Gimli.Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.- What's happening?
- Where is he going?Where's he going?I don't understand.Lord Aragorn!Why does he leave on the eve of battle?He leaves because there is no hope.He leaves because he must.Too few have come.We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.No...we cannot.But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.I have left instruction.The people are to follow your rule in my stead.Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.Long may you defend Edoras...if the battle goes ill.What other duty would you have me do, my lord?Duty?No.I would have you smile again...not grieve for those whose time has come.You shall live to see these days renewed...and no more despair.What kind of army would linger in such a place?One that is cursed.Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...to the last king of Gondor...to come to his aid...to fight.But when the time came...when Gondor's need was dire...they fled...vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.And so Isildur cursed them...never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.Who shall call them from the grey twilight?The forgotten people.The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.From the north shall he come.Need shall drive him.He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.The way is shut.It was made by those who are dead.And the Dead keep it.The way is shut.Brego!I do not fear death.Well, this is a thing unheard-of.An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?Oh.Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.We must ride light and swift.It is a long road ahead.And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.All my friends have gone to battle.I would be ashamed to be left behind.It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.I want to fight.I will say no more.Ride with me.My lady.Form up! Move out!Form up! Move out!Ride!Ride now to Gondor!What is it?What do you see?I see shapes of men.And of horses.Where?Pale banners like shreds of cloud.Spears rise...like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.The Dead are following.They have been summoned.The Dead?Summoned?I knew that.Very good.Very good! Legolas!Do not look down.Who enters my domain?One who will have your allegiance.The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.You will suffer me.The way is shut.It was made by those who are dead.And the Dead keep it.The way is shut.Now you must die.I summon you to fulfill your oath.None but the king of Gondor may command me.That line was broken.It has been remade.Fight for us...and regain your honor.What say you?What say you?You waste your time, Aragorn.They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.I am Isildur's heir.Fight for me...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.What say you?You have my word!Fight, and I will release you from this living death!What say you?!Stand, you traitors!Out!Legolas!Run!We fight.Open the gate! Quick!Quick! Hurry!Faramir!Say not that he has fallen.They were outnumbered.None survived.Fear.The city is rank with it.Let us ease their pain.Release the prisoners.Catapults!My sons are spent.My line has ended.He's alive!The House of Stewards has failed.He needs medicine, my lord.My line has ended!My lord!Rohan...has deserted us.Theoden's betrayed me.Abandon your posts!Flee! Flee for your lives!Prepare for battle!Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!Over here!Return to your posts!Send these foul beasts into the abyss.Stay where you are.We need more rubble!Watch out!Down to the lower levels. Quick!Double up, men!Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.Stand to your posts! Fight!Not at the towers!Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!Bring them down!Fight them back!Peregrin Took!- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.This is no place for a Hobbit.Guard of the Citadel, indeed.Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!What are you doing, you useless scum?!The door won't give. It's too strong.Get back there and smash it down.But nothing can breach it.Grond will breach it.Bring up the wolf's head.Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!Grond! Grond! Grond!Grond! Grond! Grond!Grond! Grond! Grond!Grond! Grond! Grond!Grond! Grond! Grond!You may go no further.You will not enter Gondor.Who are you to deny us passage?Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.Mind your aim.That's it. Right. We warned you.Prepare to be boarded.Boarded?By you and whose army?This army.In there.What is this place?Master must go inside the tunnel.Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.It's the only way.Go in...or go back.I can't go back.- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.Orcses come in here sometimes.Hurry.This way.Smeagol?Over here.It's sticky. What is it?You will see.Oh, yes.You will see.Smeagol?Smeagol!Smeagol!Sam.And you, Frodo Baggins...I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.May it be a light for you in dark places...when all other lights go out.Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!
(Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!)Naughty little fly.Why does he cry?Caught in a webSoon you'll be...Eaten.Got away, did it, precious?Not this time.- Not this time!
- No!It wasn't us. It wasn't us!Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.We promised.You must believe us.It was the precious.The precious made us do it.I have to destroy it, Smeagol.I have to destroy it for both our sakes.No!I'm so sorry, Sam.I'm so sorry.This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.If you do not find a way...no one will.The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.The lower level's in flames.Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.Time is against us.Make ready!Take heart, Merry.It will soon be over.My lady...you are fair and brave...and have much to live for...and many who love you.I know it is too late to turn aside.I know there is not much point now in hoping.If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...But
- I'm not.I'm a Hobbit.And I know I can't save Middle-earth.I just want to help my friends.Frodo.Sam.Pippin.More than anything, I wish I could see them again.Prepare to move out!Make haste. We ride through the night.To battle.To battle.Back to the gate!Hurry!I am steward of the House of Anarion.Thus have I walked.And thus now will I sleep.Gondor is lost.There is no hope for Men.Why do the fools fly?Better to die sooner than late.For die we must.No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.Bring wood and oil.Steady.Steady.You are soldiers of Gondor.No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.Run!Volley!Fire!Let him go, you filth.Let him go!You will not touch him again.Come on and finish it.Back!Mr. Frodo.Oh, no.Frodo.Mr. Frodo.Wake up.Don't leave me here alone.Don't go where I can't follow.Wake up.Not asleep.Dead.You get back, you scum!What's this?Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.Killed another one, has she?No.This fellow ain't dead.Not dead?- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.Then she has her way with them.That's how she likes to feed.Fresh blood.Get him to the tower!Samwise, you fool.This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.Then he'll wish he'd never been born.The house of his spirit crumbles.He is burning.Already burning.He's not dead.He's not dead!No! No!No! No!He's not dead!- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!I release you from my service.Go now and die in what way seems best to you.Pour oil on the wood!Come on, soldier! Move it!- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!Where is Gandalf?Gandalf!Retreat!The city is breached!Fall back! To the second level!Get the women and children out!Get them out!Retreat!Come on. Come on, move.Move into the city. Kill all in your path.Take them down!Fight! Fight to the last man!Fight for your lives!Gandalf!Gandalf!Denethor has lost his mind!He's burning Faramir alive!Up! Quickly!Go back to the abyss.Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.Do you not know death when you see it, old man?This is my hour.Gandalf!You have failed.The world of Men will fall.Courage, Merry.Courage for our friends.Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!Pikes in front. Archers behind.Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.Flank ready.Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.Forth, and fear no darkness!Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...a sword-day, a red day...and the sun rises!Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.Ride now!Ride now!Ride! Ride for ruin...and the world's ending!- Death!
- Death!- Death!
- Death!- Death!
- Death!- Death!
- Death!For Eorlingas!Fire!Death!Charge!Fire at will!Set a fire in our flesh.Stay this madness!You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...but against the power that has risen in the east...there is no victory.No!You will not take my son from me!No!Faramir.So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.Drive them to the river!Make safe the city!Re-form the line!Re-form the line!Sound the charge! Take them head-on!Charge!Cut him down!Take the reins. Pull him left!Left!Aim for their heads!Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!Merry!Merry!I didn't think it would end this way.End?No, the journey doesn't end here.Death is just another path...one that we all must take.The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...and all turns to silver glass.And then you see it.What, Gandalf?See what?White shores...and beyond.A far green country...under a swift sunrise.Well...that isn't so bad.No.No, it isn't.Rally to me! To me!Feast on his flesh.I will kill you if you touch him.Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.Late as usual, pirate scum!There's knife-work here needs doing.Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!There's plenty for the both of us.May the best Dwarf win.You fool.No man can kill me.Die now.I am no man.- 15! 16!
- 17!Merry!Legolas!33, 34.That still only counts as one!Come on, then. Come on!I know your face...Eowyn.My eyes darken.No.No.I am going to save you.You already did.Eowyn...my body is broken.You have to let me go.I go to my fathers...in whose mighty company...I shall not now feel ashamed.Eowyn.Release us.Bad idea.Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.You gave us your word.I hold your oath fulfilled.Go.Be at peace.Merry.No!No!With a sigh.You turn away.With a deepening heart.No more words to say.You will find.That the world has changed forever.And the trees are now turning from green to gold.And the sun is now fading.I wish I could hold you closer.Merry!Merry!Merry.Merry, it's me.It's Pippin.I knew you'd find me.Yes.Are you going to leave me?No, Merry.I'm going to look after you.Hands off!That shiny shirt, that's mine.It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.The scum tried to knife me.Kill him!That's for Frodo!And for the Shire!And that's for my old Gaffer!Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.Not if I stick you first.Sam!Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.Sorry for everything.- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.They've taken it. Sam...they took the Ring.Begging your pardon, but they haven't.I thought I'd lost you.So I took it.Only for safekeeping.Give it to me.Give me the Ring, Sam.Sam.Give me the Ring.You must understand.The Ring is my burden.It will destroy you, Sam.Come on, Mr. Frodo.We best find you some clothes.You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.We did it, Mr. Frodo.We made it to Mordor.There are so many of them.We'll never get through unseen.It's him, the Eye.We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.There's nothing for it.Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.Frodo has passed beyond my sight.The darkness is deepening.If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.It's only a matter of time.He has suffered a defeat, yes but...behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.Let him stay there.Let him rot! Why should we care?Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.I've sent him to his death.No.There is still hope for Frodo.He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.- We can give him that.
- How?Draw out Sauron's armies.Empty his lands.Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.Not for ourselves.But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.Keep him blind to all else that moves.A diversion.Certainty of death...small chance of success...what are we waiting for?Sauron will suspect a trap.He will not take the bait.Oh, I think he will.Long have you hunted me.Long have I eluded you.No more.Behold the Sword of Elendil.The city has fallen silent.There is no warmth left in the sun.It grows so cold.It's just the damp of the first spring rain.I do not believe this darkness will endure.Look, the Orcs...they're moving off.You see, Mr. Frodo...some luck at last.Move it, you slugs!Come on! Faster!Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...I'll whip you down to the bone, you...Come on!What have I told you?No evation...Now move it!Get up!Come on, you slugs!You two are going straight to the front line!Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!Don't you know we're at war?Company, halt!Inspection!Sam, help me.Mr. Frodo!Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!It's so heavy.Oh, no.What do I do? What do we do?- Hit me.
- What?Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.Get off of me!Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.Get off of me!Break it up! Break it up!Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!Go, Sam. Now!Move along, scum!Back in the line!You maggots!Get back into the line, you slugs!Dig it, you slugs. Move it.I can't...I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.It's... It's...It's such a weight to carry.It's...Such a weight.We're going that way. Straight as we can.There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.Mr. Frodo.Look.There is light...and beauty up there...that no shadow can touch.Take mine.There's a few drops left.There will be none left for the return journey.I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.Frodo, get down!Hide!Frodo!Where are they?Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!Let justice be done upon him!My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?We do not come to treat with Sauron...faithless and accursed.Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.He is to depart these lands, never to return.Old Greybeard.I have a token I was bidden to show thee.Frodo.Frodo.- Silence.
- No!Silence!The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?And he did, Gandalf.He did.And who is this?Isildur's heir?It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.I guess that concludes negotiations.I do not believe it.I will not.Pull back.Pull back!It's gone, Mr. Frodo.The light's passed on, away towards the north.Something's drawn its gaze.Hold your ground! Hold your ground.Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!I see in your eyes...the same fear that would take the heart of me.A day may come when the courage of Men fails...when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.But it is not this day.An hour of wolves and shattered shields...when the age of Men comes crashing down.But it is not this day.This day we fight!By all that you hold dear on this good earth...I bid you stand, Men of the West!Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.What about side by side with a friend?Aye.I could do that.Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?It'll be spring soon.And the orchards will be in blossom.And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.Do you remember the taste of strawberries?No, Sam.I can't recall the taste of food...nor the sound of water...nor the touch of grass.I'm...naked in the dark.There's... there's nothing.No veil between me and the wheel of fire.I can see him...with my waking eyes.Then let us be rid of it...once and for all.Come on, Mr. Frodo.I can't carry it for you...but I can carry you.Come on!Aragorn.Elessar.For Frodo.Look, Mr. Frodo.A doorway.We're almost there.Clever Hobbits to climb so high!Mustn't go that way.Mustn't hurt the precious.You swore!You swore on the precious!Smeagol promised!Smeagol lied.Frodo!Eagles.The eagles are coming!Frodo!I'm here, Sam.Destroy it!Go on! Now!Throw it in the fire!What are you waiting for?Just let it go!The Ring is mine.No.No.No!Yes!Yes!Precious! Precious!Precious! Precious!Give me your hand!Take my hand!No!Don't you let go.Don't let go.Reach!Frodo!Frodo!It's gone.It's done.Yes, Mr. Frodo.It's over now.I can see the Shire.The Brandywine River.Bag End.Gandalf's fireworks.The lights in the Party Tree.Rosie Cotton dancing.She had ribbons in her hair.If ever I was to marry someone...it would've been her.It would've been her.I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...here at the end of all things.Gandalf?Frodo!Gimli!Now come the days of the king.May they be blessed.This day does not belong to one man...but to all.Let us together rebuild this world...that we may share in the days of peace.Et Earello...

(Thank you.)My friends...you bow to no one.And thus it was.A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.And the Fellowship of the Ring...though eternally bound by friendship and love...was ended.Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.We were home.Hi.Hey, watch the pumpkin.More of the same, Rosie.Good night, lads.How do you pick up the threads of an old life?How do you go on...when in your heart you begin to understand...there is no going back?There are some things that time cannot mend...some hurts that go too deep...that have taken hold.Mr. Frodo?What is it?It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.It's never really healed.""There and Back Again."" A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.And ""The Lord of the Rings"" by Frodo Baggins.You finished it.Not quite.There's room for a little more.Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...that each of us must come and go in the telling.Bilbo's story was now over.There would be no more journeys for him...save one.Tell me again, lad, where are we going?To the harbor, Bilbo.The Elves have accorded you a special honor...a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.Frodo...any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?The one I gave you.I'm sorry, Uncle.I'm afraid I lost it.Oh.Pity.I should like to have held it one last time.Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.The power of the Three Rings is ended.The time has come...for the dominion of Men.I Aear can ven na mar.
(The sea calls us home.)I think I'm...quite ready for another adventure.Farewell...my brave Hobbits.My work is now finished.Here at last, on the shores of the sea...comes the end of our Fellowship.I will not say, ""Do not weep""...for not all tears are an evil.It is time, Frodo.What does he mean?We set out to save the Shire, Sam.And it has been saved.But not for me.You don't mean that.You can't leave.The last pages are for you, Sam.My dear SamYou cannot always be torn in two.You will have to be one and whole for many years.You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.Your part in the story will go on.Well...I'm back."

Skull's caved in.You ever take a homicide
picture before, son?Well, at least
he won't be movin' on me.That's for sure. I want you to cover every
angle. Do you hear me? Every angle.Uh, you boys,
move on back now, OK?Came all this way
to build us a factory,make somethin' outta this town.Look what it got him.Yeah.Sam, did he have a wallet,
identification, anything like that?That's the first thing I looked for.
Whoever fixed him musta took 'em.Nothin', huh?- Any witnesses?
- I mean, not even a cat.- How long's he been dead?
- Oh, less than an hour.- Less than an hour.
- Maybe half that.Maybe half.Could have been a hitchhiker.Check both ends of town, check the
depot, and check the pool hall. OK?- Pool hall closes at one o'clock, Chief.
- I said check it, Sam.Yes, sir.On your feet, boy.I mean now!Get against that wall.
Get them hands high!You spread them fingers.
I wanna count all ten.You move before I tell you to, boy,
by God, I'm gonna clean your plow.That's pretty fat there,
ain't it, boy? Huh?Now, outside there's a police car.
You're gonna pick up that bag.You're gonna walk out, and you're
gonna plant yourself in the back.And you're gonna be a real
nice quiet boy all the way in.You hear?!C'mon, boy.Move it!Chief here?- Hey, what's up, Sam?
-  Chief?What's goin' on?Sam?- Wood?
- Yes, sir?When's the last time I asked Courtney
to get oil for this damn thing?Uh, last Wednesday.Would you be kind enough to go outside
and remind him what day it is <i>today?</i>Well, uh...
how about the prisoner here?Don't you worry about him.Got a name, boy?Virgil Tibbs.Virgil?Well, I don't think we're gonna
have any trouble, are we, Virgil?No trouble at all.Oh, you can go now, Sam.Yes, sir.- What did you hit him with?
- Hit whom?""Whom""?
Whom?You a Northern boy? What's a Northern
boy like you doin' all the way down here?I was waiting for the train.There ain't no trains
this time of mornin'.- Tuesdays only. 4:05 to Memphis.
- You say.Well...
All right, you say right.All right...
Virgil.Oh!Now look.I try to run a nice, clean,
safe town here.A town where a man can sneeze and not
get his brains beat out. You follow me?Yes.Why don't you tell me how you killed Mr.
Colbert? You'll feel a whole lot better.Not now!I was visiting my mother.I came in on the 12:35 from Brownsville.I was waiting to go
out on the 4:05.Mm-hm.Yeah.And meanwhile, you killed yourself a
white man and picked yourself up $200!I earned that money, ten hours
a day, seven days a week.Colored can't earn that. It's more than I
make in a month! Where did you earn it?!- Philadelphia.
- Mississippi?- Pennsylvania.
- Just how do you earn that kinda money?I'm a police officer.Oh, yeah.- Wood!
- Yes, sir!- Did you question this man?
- No, sir.Would you mind taking
a look at that?Yeah! Oh, yeah!I'll check on this wise city boy.
You take him outside and hold him.Yes, sir.May I suggest that you call my chief
rather than send a wire or anything?I mean, it would be quicker.
And I'll pay for the call.Did you hear? Did you hear him
say he'd pay for the call?How much do they pay you
to do their police work?$162.39 per week.$162.39 a week!Well, boy! Take him outside, Wood.
But treat him easy,because a man that
makes $162.39 a week...man, we do not wanna ruffle him!No, sir!Courtney... would you try
and get me long-distance?Police business, honey.
Chief's on the line.No. He catch you listenin' in, he'll
run your butt around the block.- He don't panic me none.
- No?- Where's the chief?
- You got the pictures of the dead man?Sure do. I got him top,
bottom, sideways... you name it.- Good. I'll take 'em, son.
- No, I wanna give 'em to the chief.- I said I'd take 'em, Charlie.
- Do like he tells you, Charlie.Somebody owes me
some money for those.I had to buy paper and film
and developin'.That's all right. Just bill the department.
Everything will be taken care of.God Almighty.
He sure looks bad.May I see the man
I am supposed to have killed?Sure.
I don't know why not.<i>Hey, Sam.
He's finished talkin'.</i>- Here's the photos of the dead man.
- OK.Got your chief on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.Hello? Yes, sir. I'm sorry to
have gotten you involved in this.I really had no choice.Yes, sir.You can't be serious, sir. I mean, even if
I could be of help, they wouldn't want it.No, sir. I'm not prejudiced.Yes, sir. I am a police officer and
they're police officers, but...Hello. This is Gillespie.
Yes, sir. Yep, well...You don't say?He's your number one
homicide expert?Well, my, my, my.I don't think we need any help.
We can wrap this up ourselves.Yes, sir.
But I do want to thank youfor offering me such a powerful piece
of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.Yes, sir. Thank you.
Yeah. Goodbye, now.Oh, it's all there. We paid
for the phone call ourselves.Now, you are the number one
homicide expert.- That's right.
- I bet you look at a lot of dead bodies.Lots.Well?- Well, what?
- Well...I just thought maybe, uh... Maybe you
wouldn't mind takin' a look at this one?No, thanks.- Why not, expert?
- Because I've got a train to catch.Wait a minute.
That train don't leave till noon.They pay you $162.39 a week just to look
at bodies. Why can't you look at this one?- Why can't you look at it for yourself?
- Because I'm not an expert...Officer!Ten cents, ten million dollars... just
doesn't matter when a man's time comes.Mm-hm.I could give him a nicer service
right here in Spartathan he could ever get up there in
Chicago. And at half the price, too.I got a rosewood casket out there...Ted Ulam, Chief.
We haven't had the pleasure.That's for sure.He's with me.Hello, Doc.Yep.Well...Uh...Do you wanna look at it?New manicure.
That's good.That's very good.- I'll need a few things.
-  Such as?Ammonium hydrosulfide,
benzidine, superoxide of hydrogen.Copper powder, distilled water.A six-inch celluloid scale.Thermometer.Some tweezers.Calipers.
And some toothpicks.Toothpicks?! Copper...?
What's goin' on here, Chief?Who is this boy anyway?I asked him to look at the body.
That's who he is.It's 4:45.
What time was this man killed?Sam found him at 3 a.m. The doctor
says it's he was killed an hour earlier.- At two?
- Maybe a little later.2115... 2:30?Would you feel the
face and jaw, please?Am I mistaken,
or has rigor begun?It has.You'll notice too that
postmortem lividity is present.So the time of death really has
to be earlier. Wouldn't you say?Mm.Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that
as soon as I get a thermometer.As you know, the loss of heat from
the brain is the most reliable wayof determining time of death.Right, Chief?Oh, yeah.Well...Which one of you gentlemen
will assist me?Ulam's Funer...
It's for you, Chief.Yeah. Talk to me.When?Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I've
got a runaway suspect, boy. I gotta go.Now listen, you. Anything he wants,
man, you better see that he gets it.Where can I wash my hands?This here's Shagbag, you hear?
He's headed for the river.The river, you hear?
He's gonna be in Arkansas.Shoot.OK. I got him.Mrs. Colbert.How is she taking it?Chief had to leave.
She don't know it yet.Hey! You can't go in there, boy!- Mrs. Colbert?
- Where's my husband?What's happened to him? Why won't
anybody tell me what's happened to him?Why won't anybody here tell me?
I have a right to know if he's hurt,if he's been in an accident.
I want to know if he is all right!Your husband is dead,
Mrs. Colbert.Uh...Somebody killed him.We don't know who... yet.It's, uh...It's very hot in here.It's very hot in this room.Sit down.No.Would you...Would you... leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?Virgil, we don't need you or your
microscopes. Tell that to your chief.We don't need him... or you.Mrs. Colbert's in there.- I've already told her.
- I see.Here is the examination results from
Ulam's. You wanna know what I found?No. I don't need to
look at 'em now.May I examine this prisoner?Yeah, you can look at him.
C'mon, let him look. Go on.All right, now! Steady!You finished?Thank you.All right, Fryer,
bring him with me.- Now we're grindin' corn!
- You shoulda been there!If it weren't for them radios, we woulda
lost him goin' over that bridge.That old boy highballing that
train like to cut us off.And old Charlie's hound
dog got loose...- Did he confess?
- Huh?The man you arrested,
did he confess?Well, I believe he will.Yes siree, I believe he will.I believe he will.- He's left-handed, isn't he?
- How do <i>I</i> know?Well, he seemed left-handed to me.I believe Harvey <i>is</i> a southpaw.
Now, ain't he, Shagbag?What if he is?
What's that make him?Innocent.Mrs. Colbert...
There's just one more thing.Yeah.I picked it up, I tell you. He was already
lyin' there. It was lyin' there next to him!I just picked it up, ma'am.
That's all I did.Shut up.- Get him outta here.
- OK. C'mon, Harvey. Let's go.Mrs. Colbert, I, uh... I wonder if you'd
mind if I have somebody drive you overso you could, uh...
complete the identification?Martin, I want you to take Mrs. Colbert
over to the funeral parlor.And, Wood,
run Virgil down the depot.Uh... Virge here, Chief,
he thinks that Harvey's innocent.- Well, I'll be damned.
- Could I talk to you about it, in private?No. Because I got Colbert's wallet in my
hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.- You think he gave it to him?
- I don't know.But Oberst could have come along
after the crime, found it, picked it up.- I don't know.
- That's what the boy said he did.Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I say different.When I examined the deceased, it was
obvious the fatal blow was struckfrom an angle of 17 degrees
from the right, which makes italmost certain the person
who did it is right-handed.- So what?
-  Harve's left-handed, Chief.Everybody in town knows that.We figured that out.
Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny
name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.- What do they call you up there?
- They call me Mr. Tibbs!Mr. Tibbs! Well, Mr. Wood, take
Mr. Tibbs, take him down to the depot.And I mean, boy, like now!I'll have the FBI lab
send you the report on this.Not that it'll make
any difference.I'll take that.No, you won't.I'm sending it in personally.My God!What kind of people are you?What kind of a place is this?My husband is dead.Somebody in this town killed him!
I want you to find out who!You gonna give me that?No, I'm not.Wood, you take him,and you lock him up
for withholding evidence.Go on, move! Put him with
his friend, Harvey Oberst!Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains
to the hogs, that's for damn sure.Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.
We got another customer.Hey, man, not in here.- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button.Play it cool, boy.
Play it cool.Hey!- Hey!What you doin'
wearin' white man's clothes?Where d'you come from?You deaf or somethin'?Listen, I'm get...Keep cool, Harvey.I'm on your side.Well, I don't need you!I'm all you've got.Police?You're a cop?- You're a cop.
- Mm-hm.Yeah?So, how come they locked you up?
How come they lock up a cop?Who said they locked me up?How come with all these empty cells here
they'd throw me in with you? You dig?Look.I already told 'em.I see this fella lyin' on
the street there.And there's this wallet
lyin' beside him.Boy, I mean, I come into
this world outta luck.Here's the first good thing
to come my way. And I pick it up.But when I see whose
wallet it is...I mean, I start to sweat. But I heard
about this new chief. This Gillepsie?Got no more smile
than a turnip.So I cut across the fields, headin' for the
line, and got myself as far as the bridgebefore Gillespie grabbed me.What time did you find the wallet?Well, I ain't got no watch, but it must have
been after two, by the courthouse clock.I'm interested in eleven to two.
Where were you?Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.
I got there about ten.- What time'd you leave?
- Closin'. Must have been one.- Anybody can swear for you?
- Packy, Burt, Les.Ever been in trouble
with the police before?Come on.I could ask at the desk,
you know.Well, they brought
me in one time.- On account of this Delores Purdy.
- On what charge?Well, uh, this Delores,
she, uh...she's real proud of what nature
done for her, you know?And, uh...Well, we was on a date
up to Clarke's Point, and, uh...she says, uh...Anyway, she asks me,
she says, uh...""Don't you think I got
a classy build?""And I say ""Sure.""And so she starts to show me.But I didn't do nothin' wrong.I just didn't stop her from
tryin' to prove her point.Then this cop, Sam Wood,comes chargin' outta the bush
and hauls me in.He let you go, didn't he?Told me not to mess with her no more.
She lives on Third, a block from me.Traipsin' around in the altogether.
With the lights on.Now, somebody sure oughta
make her stop doin' that.Come here.Let me see your right hand.- What you doin'?
- Hold still.All right now, give him
the waiver for false arrest.<i>Forget it.</i>I'm askin' you to sign it.
Please.Give him a pen.
Give him a pen.All right. Let him out.You'll be able to catch
the 12:10 train.It wouldn't be a bad idea to
change the charge against Oberst.He was nowhere near the scene of the
crime, and I think he can prove it.- I bet you know when Colbert was killed.
- About 12:30.- While Harvey was still shooting pool.
- Wait a minute. I'll get it.There's cue chalk under his nails,
not dried blood.- Thank God I don't live in Philadelphia.
- One more thing.Colbert wasn't killed
where the body was found.- What do you mean?
- He was killed then moved to Main Street.- Courtney?
- Yes, sir?Change the charge to theft.D'you mean Harve?Who the hell else do
we have back there?!Yes, sir.Hey.Didn't I ask you to fix that gate?No, not me, sir. Must have been
my brother Harold. He's on days.Harold.Police department.Yes, he's here.
Hold on, sir.Mayor's on the line, Chief.What's all this Mrs. Colbert's been
tellin' me about a... a cover-up arrest?No, ma'am.
We ain't had no cover-up.In fact, we just dropped the
charges for insufficient evidence.Mrs. Colbert, I told you
he was nobody's man.I came by to make it
as clear as I possibly canthat I do not want that Negro
officer taken off this case.Negro officer?Yeah, well, he, uh...
He comes from up North, you see.And he was, uh, kinda...- passin' through...
- If it wasn't for him,your impartial chief of police would
still have the wrong man behind bars.I want that officer
given a free hand.Otherwise, I will pack up
my husband's engineers...and leave you...to yourselves.Mrs. Colbert, now don't you
worry about a thing.Believe me, we're gonna
take care of everything.Bill?I wanna see you come through
this now, you hear?Even if we have to step
on Endicott's toes?Even that.But do it fast.All right.Now, Bill, how about
this here Negro officer?Mrs. Colbert seems
to have confidence in him.Oh, he ain't nothin'.
Some kind of a...some kind of a homicide expert.
But I don't need him.You mean you don't want him.
But you do need him.Now look, Bill.
Suppose he turns up the killer.He has no police power here. He's gonna
have to hand him over on a platter, right?That's right.And if he fails,
you're off the hook,'cause it was Mrs. Colbert's idea
in the first place.See what I mean?Oh, yeah.Works out all the way around, Bill.
For all of us.Excuse me.Any reason why you have
to leave today?There's lots of reasons.What would you say if
I asked you to stay for a while?No.This town needs a
factory, Virgil.Colbert come down
from Chicago to build it.I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.
Half of them'd be colored.- Know what that means?
- Probably got him killed.That's what Mrs. Colbert thinks.
She wants us to catch her a killer.No killer, no factory.Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta
colored people. You follow me?- I'm going home, man.
- They're your people.Not mine... yours.
You made this scene.- What do you want me to do? Beg you?
- Look, I've had your town up to here!Boy, it would give me a world of
satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!My father used to say that.- Even did, once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.Now you listen to me.Just once in my life
I'm gonna hold my temper.I'm tellin' you that
you're gonna stay.You'll stay here if I have to have your
chief remind you what he told you to do.But I don't think
I have to do that, you see?No. Because you're so damned smart.
You're smarter than any white man.You're just gonna stay here
and show us all.You could never live with yourself
unless you could put us all to shame.You wanna know something, Virgil?I don't think that you could let
an opportunity like that pass by.Jess?Jess, this is, uh...This is Virgil.
He's workin' for me.Give him somethin' that runs.
Fix him up.What I fix, runs.
Who pays?Police.Well, you know
where to find me.What you doin' here, man?Policeman.You're a policeman here in Sparta?They've got a murder
they don't know what to do with.They need a whipping boy.You got a roof?No. I'll find a motel.Viola... We got company.Know what's gonna happen?He gonna get hisself killed.You watch and see he don't.I'm aware of the risk, Tom. But, like
it or not, we're stuck with him.Not if the chief here
is right on the ball.What do you say, Chief?You got that old killer all lined
up in your front sights, hm?I'm workin' on it.Tom, climb off
of Gillespie's back now.You know damn well we didn't
hire him off a homicide squad.Yeah, well,
it's gonna be his week.'Cause Colbert's only the start.I say this nigger won't
live past Saturday.Mrs. Colbert, can you tell me
about your husband's enemies?That's Endicott.
He's been fighting us all the way.He sits up on his hill
and runs this county.Or did, until we moved in.Did your husband tell you
where he was going last night?He said he wasn't sleepy.
I went to bed.What time was that?A little after 11, I think.Did he call you, or anybody
on your staff, after 11?No.Maybe the elevator boy
can tell us what time he went out.They put it on
self-service after ten.Did your husband use a car here?Find anything?- Whoever killed Colbert drove this oar.
- How do you know?Where you goin'?I'd drive up there, but I'm sure you
don't want me running up there by myself.- Up where?
- Eric Endicott's.Endicott's?!
Come on, now!None of that for you,
huh, Virgil?<i>âª In the heat of the night</i><i>âª Mm-hm, ain't a woman yet been born</i><i>âª Yeah</i><i>âª Knows how to make the mornin' come</i><i>âª It's so hard to keep control</i><i>âª Yes, it is</i><i>âª When I could sell my soul</i><i>âª For just a little light</i><i>âª In the heat of the night</i>Listen. You know
something I don't know?I found a piece of osmunda
in Colbert's car.- A piece of what?
- On the brake pedal. Osmunda. Fern root.Fern root?
Oh, is Mr. Endicott here?Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.
Would you follow me, please?- Gillespie.
- Mr. Endicott.This here's Virgil.- Mr. Tibbs.
- How do you do, sir?Oh, may I have Henry fetch you
somethin'? Some light refreshment?- No, thank you. We're all right...
- I'll have something cold, soft. Anything.Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.
I'll have one, too.Yes, sir.I didn't know it was possible
to grow this species locally.- Oh, you like flowers?
- I do.Mr. Tibbs, do you know
anything about orchids?- Not very much, but I do like them.
- Well, let me show you.Endicott's folly.- What do you think?
- It's beautiful. It's breathtaking.Have you a favorite,
Mr. Tibbs?Well, I'm partial to
any of the epiphytics.Why, isn't that remarkable!That of all the orchids in this place,
you should prefer the epiphytics.I wonder if you know why.Maybe it would be helpful
if you'd tell me.Because, like the Negro,they need care and
feedin' and cultivatin'.And that takes time.That's somethin' you can't make
some people understand.That's somethin'
Mr. Colbert didn't realize.Is this what the
epiphytics root in?My point! They thrive on it.Take it away from them,
they do poorly.- What do you call this material?
- That's osmunda. Fern root.Well, we don't wanna take any
more of your time, Mr. Endicott.Why'd you two come here?To ask you about Mr. Colbert.Let me understand this.You two came here...
to question me?Well, your...your attitudes, Mr. Endicott,your points of view,
are a matter of record.Some people... let us say the
people who work for Mr. Colbert...might reasonably regard you as the person
least likely to mourn his passing.We were just trying
to clarify some of the evidence.Was Mr. Colbert ever in this greenhouse?
Say, last night, about midnight?Gillespie?Yeah?- You saw it.
- Oh, I saw it.What are you gonna do about it?I don't know.I'll remember that.There was a time...
when I could have had you shot.- You better clear out. And I mean fast!
- What about that speech you gave me?I didn't know you'd slap any white man!
Least of all Endicott!All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.I can pull that fat cat down.
I can bring him right off this hill!Oh, boy.Man, you're just like
the rest of us.Ain't ya?It's all my fault.But there's no point
in ducking it.It's gonna be tough
to keep you in your job now.Now look Bill. I don't have to tell you
how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.- No. I already told him to go.
- All right.Now, Mrs. Colbert is not
gonna be back till Thursday.You catch your guilty
party by then,she won't hold it against us we had
to send Tibbs home for his own good.But you gotta do it, you hear?I hear.Bill?What's made you change
your mind about Tibbs?Who says I have?Last chief we had,he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he
slapped Endicott, claimed self-defense.- Gillespie here.
- Courtney here, sir.<i>- Did you take Virgil down the depot?
- No, sir. He just plain wouldn't go.</i>- <i>Shagbag saw him headin' to River Road.</i>
- Check.Hey! C'mon!
C'mon!Hey! C'mon!OK, black boy. We come here
to teach you some manners.We told you about them bad manners,
boy. You better put that down.Why don't you
come and get it, baby?C'mon, man. You ain't nothin'.
C'mon. Let's get him.We'll put that round your neck.Hit him, man!
Get him from the side!Get behind him!All right, hold it!All right, boys.You've had your fun.
Now go on, you just run along home.Nigger-lover.- I didn't catch what you said.
- Get rid of the nigger.You don't... we will.Now, is that a suggestion,
or is that an order?That's a warnin'!I see.I see.Shut up and take this trash outta here!
Come on, move it and go!Well, you finally get
the message, Virgil?!May I get in?- Thought you left town.
- Not yet.Could you follow the same route you
followed Tuesday night, same speed?- Why?
- Why not?- Maybe I better check with the chief.
- I wouldn't want him to slap you downfor steppin' outta line,makin' decisions on
your own, and all that.He don't knock me outta my socks.Let's get rollin', Virgil.<i>âª All you little birds better
lock up tight</i><i>âª 'Cause there's a foul owl
on the prowl tonight</i><i>âª Hey, little lark, get outta the dark</i><i>âª Foul owl on the prowl</i><i>âª Cute little jay, stay outta his way</i><i>âª Foul owl on the prowl</i><i>âª You just might be the quail he'll tail</i><i>âª Foul owl on the prowl</i><i>âª You just might be

king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.That is, if that peckerwood
ain't sold out again.- Can I bring you anything?
- No. I'm coming in.I thought I told you to
get outta here.- I'm not ready to leave.
- I was gonna tell you, Chief.- You forget about those four maniacs?
- I need more time.- Do I have to put you on the train myself?!
- I guess so!Whoa.All right, Virgil.
Just what the hell do you want?I wanna know exactly where Sam was
at all times on the night of the murder.<i>âª If you pass his tree... flee</i><i>âª If you catch his eye... fly</i>Virgil, if you get killed, we'll have
one hell of a mess in this town.You know that?I know.Got some real luscious cream pie
for you tonight, Sam.I mean Officer Wood.
Just like you always order.You know I don't eat that stuff. The chief
likes his boys streamlined. Right, Chief?Why don't you shut up, Sam?- All right, what'll you have, Virgil?
- I ain't servin' him!Tuesday night you walked
out of here at 2:40. Right?Right on the button.Two minutes from now.That's for him.Now, what'd you do
when you came out that night?Well, I picked up the
radio and called in.Do it, please.Go ahead.
Go ahead.Uh... Wood to radio.
I'm leavin' Compton's now.<i>Sam, look sharp.
Gillespie's sniff in' around.</i>Gimme that thing!Courtney, your brother says I didn't tell
him to fix that hinge, so I told <i>you.</i>Do you read me,
Courtney?<i>- Oh, I'll get right on it, Chief.</i>
- I'd do that if I were you.<i>Yes, sir. Ten-four.</i>All right, you can move us.
Officer Wood.- Why'd you do that, Sam?
- Do what?Change your route
back there at the corner.Who says I changed?Look, I oughta know what I did!
Chief, do I have to put up with this?Do I work for you,
or do I work for him?Good night, gentlemen.I don't know.- I don't know.
- Well, I appreciate anything you can do.- This is highly irregular.
- Yeah, I know that.Showing our depositors' accounts?
Hm. I don't know.- You sure this is an official request?
- Yes. It's official, yes.- You willing to put that in writing?
- Yeah. I'll put it in writing.On police department letterhead?I would write it on the head
of a pin if you want it there.- I gotta have somethin' for the file.
- I realize that, but I'm in a hurry.Well, we'll see.He's had an account with us
for several years now.That so?Not a large account.Never more than... Yeah.$208.That was back in '62.
September.I am not interested in '62 September.
I am interested in yesterday.Yesterday? Well...Well.According to this,
he made a deposit of... $632.- Yesterday?
- Yes.- Thank you.
- Must have been when I was out to lunch.A deposit that size,
I'd remember.Oh, you'll send me that letter
for the file, you hear?I'll tell you, baby brother, the chief
didn't like him, not even from the first.- Morning.
- Where do you think you're goin'?It's all right. Let him go.I just talked to the FBI lab. We can
prove Colbert was in that greenhouse.Endicott's covering up.I'm afraid you're too late.
We already got the guilty man.- Who?
- Sam.- Sam?
- That's right.Our man is Endicott.You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?And yesterday he makes
a big cash deposit at the bank.If I told you once,
I told you a hundred timesthat I won that matchin' quarters
and halves. It took me three years!Then why was it in big bills?
I checked.Because whenever I got enough change,
I'd trade it in on $20 bills.And when I got up to $600, I took
it down and put it in the bank.The day Colbert was killed, he cashed
a check for $900, $600 of which is gone,$300 of which I believe you left in the
wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!- What kinda man do you think I am?!
- Now, don't you push me, boy!Now listen.If you weren't
suspicious of Sam here,why did you question him last
night when he changed his route?- I knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?He was afraid I'd see some naked
white girl down the block.- What?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.She parades around in the nude at
night to get her kicks. That's...- How do you know?
- I know.Well, I know. Do you understand?I know that Colbert
cashed a check for $900.I know that Sam made a
big cash deposit.I know that you caught him in a lie.
And I know that's enough for me.C'mon, Sam.Martin, lock him up.Well?Well... you're making a mistake.Don't you bet against it.You can catch your
train now, Virgil.Tibbs?Do you think Sam did it?- Where do I find the chief?
- What's it all about?My business.Hey, look, Purdy.Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.What I got to say,
I say to the chief.It's about Sam Wood.All right.<i>Yeah?</i>Purdy's out here, sir.
It's about Sam.All right.
Send him in.She is gonna have a baby.
Sam Wood's baby.Well, ask her yourself
if you don't believe me!What are you doin' here?It's important that I hear this.I ain't talkin' about this
with him in the room.- Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!
- You be sensible. I'm a police officer.You gonna get him outta here,
or do I gotta do it?!You ain't gonna do nothin'.
You just stand there and shut up.Sit down, little girl.All right, now.You tell me... all about it.
Just tell me how it happened.Oh, come on.
Come on, girl, speak!- Well, you know how hot it's been.
- Yeah.Nights, they aren't any better.My brother works nights.He leaves me all alone.This particular night,
I go out on the porch.I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be
if I had a fountain drink.Sam comes down our road.Just like he comes every night.Passin' like a lord
in that fine, big, shiny car.Only, this time he stops.He's got a nice face,
don't you think, Chief?So he stopped.-  He says...
- What? I didn't hear what you said.<i>He says...</i>""Hey, little girl,you know what
the coolest spot in town is?""And I said ""No, Sam.
I guess I don't.""And he said...
""The cemetery. That's where.""""Know why?""âCause they got all of them
big, cool tombstones.""""Ever stretch out
on a tombstone, Delores?""""Feel all that nice, cool marble
along your body?""- He said that?
- You hear, Chief? You hear?Yeah, I hear.
I hear.All right. Sam comes along and stops in
front of your house and talks. What else?Well, come on now, girl.
What else? What else? What else?- Then I went for a ride with him.
- Where'd you go?The cemetery.So, Wood took you to the cemetery
in the patrol car, right?And then things went a bit too far.
Is that what you're sayin'?Did they get a little
bit outta line?Come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?Come on, girl!
Is it or ain't it?- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!Now, I got one more question.
Very important.Did he force you,
or did you let him?Don't mean a damn whether she
let him or not! She is still 16!In this state, that's rape!
I know the plain law on that!I know the laws in the state
of Mississippi, thank you!- Are you sure you're pregnant?
- Yes, I am pregnant!- Courtney!
- Yes, sir?Better get in here with
a pad and a pencil.Come on in. I want you
to take this all down.You had no right to keep a nigger
in the room, shame my little sister.You had no right.Virge, what's happenin'?- Hi, Harve.
- How are you?- Fine.
- Man, uh...- You sure saved my hide.
- Listen, Harvey. Man, uh...If a guy knocks up a girl in this
town, where can he go for help?- Barbershop.
- Barbershop?Borrow Mr. Fanning's razor
and cut your throat!Well...But suppose
Mr. Fanning's razor is too dull.Suppose he's got some
real money to spread around.Uh...Well, uh...There used to be a colored gal.But she kept bumpin' her price, and I
don't know if she's still in business.- What's her name?
- Well, I ain't never had to look her up.But, uh... Packy might know.Where do I find Packy?Down at the pool hall.
But, man, he wouldn't tell you.Not unless I say so.And how am I gonna say so
locked up in here?Suppose I get word to Packy that you
wanna see him? Have him come here?Will you let him
bring me a cheeseburger?Onions?Now you're talkin'!Uh... Virge?A little careless,
ain't you, Virgil?Parked in the road, you could get yourself
killed. Anybody'd know where you are.- You know what this land is?
- Yeah. It's the site for the new factory.I found a piece of wood in Colbert's
scalp. The lab identified it as pine.Three people saw Colbert drive by...
alone... on the way back from Endicott's.Colbert must have picked up somebody
in town and then come out here.I tell you he didn't
pick up nobody.Sam followed him here, come up behind
him, just like I come up behind you.- I heard you. Colbert would have too.
- He turned and he got smashed!He was hit from behind!If Delores Purdy hadn't come in,
I never would have seen the truth.I was hung up trying to get Endicott,
for personal reasons.Do you know what
I'm gonna do, Virgil?I'm gonna take you to Brownsville
and put you on the bus myself.You aren't taking me anywhere.
You dig? You're holding the wrong man!The wrong man?! I got the motive, which
is money, and the body, which is dead!- What makes you so sure?
- Why do you doubt it?!Because Colbert was killed <i>here!</i>Then driven back to town in his own
car and dumped on the streets.Sam couldn't have
driven two cars!What do you want?Give me till morning.You know...You know, Virgil,
you are among the chosen few.How's that?Well, I think that you're the first
human being that's ever been in here.Well, you can't be
too careful, man.You know a lotta things,
don't you?Well, just what do you know
about insomnia?Bourbon can't cure it.Well... that's for sure.Now look.
I got no wife. I got no kids.Boy, I got a town that...
don't want me.And I got an air conditioner
that I have to oil myself,and a desk with a busted leg.
And on top of that, I got...this, uh...place.Now, don't you think that'd drive
a man to takin' a few drinks?I'll tell you a secret.Nobody comes here.Never.You married?No.Ever been?No.Ever been close to it?Close to it.Don't you get just...
a little lonely?No lonelier than you, man.Oh, now,
don't get smart, black boy.I don't need it.No pity, thank you.No, thank you!- Yeah?
- Chief?- Yeah.
- You know where I can find Virgil?Who are you?Packy, Chief. Packy Harrison.
I'm a friend of Harve.- You got something for me?
- Yeah.- Where you goin'?
- Where whitey ain't allowed.- What the hell does that mean?
- You gave me till morning. Remember?- Here's the car.
- He could have exchanged cars by now.John, you stick here.
We'll keep cruisin'.You find him,
come back for me, you hear?That's her place, here.
You want me to wait?No, thank you, Packy.
You go on home.Mrs. Bellamy?People around here
call me Mama Caleba.Mama, I'm not from around here.
But you can put me on my train.You talk crazy.
You gin-drunk?Just homesick.Lord, Lord!Whisper two little words,
Mama, and I'm on my way.Maybe... I don't want to sever
a beautiful child like you right out.A man's name.First name, last name.The man who's paying you
for Delores Purdy's abortion.You're the boy who
works for Mr. Charlie.I thought that's who you was.Why you wanna do that?Why you wanna help the
police like that?They stealin' your soul.They chew you up and
spit you out.I'm not here to lay
a finger on you, Mama.It's the white boy I want.What you got against him?
He's paying for his fun.How much? I bet you he's not
paying you more than a hundred.You know how much he's got in his
pocket right now? More than $600!That cracker?- Where'd he come off getting 600?
- He killed Mr. Colbert.You gone crazy out
of your mind.Now listen.
Hear me good, Mama, please.Don't make me have
to send you to jail.A lot you care!There's white time in jail, and colored
time. The worst kind you can dois colored time.Child... you promise...give me understanding.I got used to better.You won't take it away?I won't take it away.Well... I don't know his name.But she's coming here tonight.Get herself straight.- Leave me alone! Let me go!
-  Let go of her!- Let go of her!
- Let go of me!Gonna teach you, boy!No club this time, man?A gun's not smart. The way you
killed Colbert was much smarter.You killed Colbert?!He's crazy. Crazy.OK, nigger.
Your time, nigger.Look in her purse.- What's that mean?
- She's got $100 to pay for an abortion.Listen to that.
That's crazy.Money she got from Ralph.You gonna listen to him?He got her to tell you
that Sam Wood did it.He made a fool out
of you, Purdy.- Delores?
- Liar!You stinkin' liar!Gimme that purse!You turned my little sister...
into a field slut?<i>Lloyd! Lloyd!</i>- Hey, man, stay back!
- He's got a gun!He's dead.When I left her house,
I was going to the diner.Mr. Colbert drove by, so I hitched
a ride with him. That's all.I said ""I sure would like a job in that
new factory once you get started.""And he said ""Sure."" And I said
""Well, I wonder where it's gonna be.""He said that field we were comin' up to
was it, and he would stop and show me.I said to myself
""Man, he's askin' for it.""I said ""Now, Ralph,
all you gotta do when we get out...is just sneak up behind him
and just... tap him.""""And then just claim that somebody
jumped us from the bushes.""That's all.I didn't mean to kill him.Yeah.All right, Courtney.
That's enough.All right. C'mon, Ralph.<i>That's all.</i><i>I didn't mean to kill him.</i>Well, got your ticket?Here you are.Thank you.- Bye-bye.

wasn't crummy enough!Now, look, fellas.
Fellas!Look, let's be
reasonable......if I don't get
a little law and order
around here......I get busted down
to a traffic corner......and your friend
don't like
traffic corners.That means you're gonna
start makin' nice......with the PRs

doin' any more brawlin'
in my territory......I'll beat the livin' crud

little girl! The road!Beat it!ALL: Beat it!Okay, come on.(ALL MUTTERING)Okay, now listen!Now, we fought hard
for this turf,and we ain't just
gonna give it up.The Emeralds claimed it,
we shot 'em out.The Hawks tried
to take it away,we knocked them
down the cellar.But these PRs
are different.They multiply.
Like cockroaches.Shut the door!
They're eatin' all the food.Breathin' all the air.Help! I'm drowning
in tamale.And you heard
what that
Lt. Schrank said......we gotta make nice
with them
Puerto Ricans or else.We gotta let 'em move in
right under our noses......and take it
all away from us or else.ALL: No!You're damn right, no!So what're we
gonna do, buddy boys?I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.We're gonna speed back!We're gonna move
like lightnin',and we're gonna
clean them Sharks up......once and for all.So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!We're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.A rumble! Chop, chop!Now cool, Action Boy.The Sharks want
a piece of this world, too.
And they're real down boys.They might ask
for blades......zip guns.
Zip guns?Gee!I ain't finalizin'
and sayin' they will,
Baby John.I'm just sayin'
that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.Now, what's your mood, Jets?I say go, go!I say mix!I say sock 'em!
Tear them!Yeah, but if they
say blades or guns...I say let's just
forget the whole thing.What?What do you say, Riff?I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got, huh.I wanna hold it
like we always held it,
with skin!But if they say blades,
I say blades.If they say guns,
I say guns.I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!To sail! To hold the sky!Then rev us off!
Voom va-voom!(ALL EXCLAIMING)RIFF: Okay, cats, we rumble!Now......protocality calls
for a war council......between us and the Sharks
to set the whole thing up.So I will personally
give the bad news
to Bernardo.You gotta take
a lieutenant with you.That's me.That's Tony.
Who needs Tony?We need Tony!He's got a rep
that's bigger than
the whole West Side!He don't belong no more.Now, cut it, Action!Me and Tony
started the Jets.So where is he?How come he takes a lousy,
stinkin' job?Youth Board
corrupted him.Yeah, temporary sickness!
Wait and see.Remember them fists
the day we clobbered
the Emeralds!He saved
my ever-loving neck!Sure! He'll do it
again, too!He always came through
for us and he always will.(JET SONG PLAYING)â« When you're a Jet

Mr. McMurphy.I know, but do you think
we might ease it down a little bit......so maybe the boys

on this ward......who couIdn't hear the music
if we turned it lower.That music is aIl they have.Your hand is staining my window.-Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am. RealIy sorry.

It doesn't matter.--is the opening of the World Series.What l'd like to suggest is that

Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking......is that we change
a very carefuIly worked-out schedule.A little change never hurt, huh?
A little variety?Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.Change it now,
and they might find it very disturbing.Ah, fuck the schedule. They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.I'm talking about the WorId Series,
Nurse Ratched. Huh?Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.How would it be if we had a vote......and let majority ruIe?Great. Let's vote on her.So aIl those in favor, raise your hands.Okay, guys, come on.Put your hands up.What's the matter with you?

they run it there or they have a riot.What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans.Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes......and that's not enough
to change ward policy.I'm sorry.HARDlNG:

-That's you, Mildred.Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,
if we send him back to PendIeton......or we send him up to Disturbed......it's just one more way of passing on
our probIem to somebody else.You know we don't like to do that.So l'd like to keep him on the ward.I think we can help him.AlI right, huh? Chief. Chief, come on.Come with me, huh? AIl right.Now, Chief, this is the spot.Right there is the spot. Remember?

very few men here who are committed.There's Mr. Bromden, Mr. Taber......some of the chronics, and you.-Cheswick?
-Hmm?You're voluntary?Mm-hm.McMURPHY:
Scanlon?BiIly, for chrissakes,
you must be committed, right?No-- No-- No.Oh. Oh, man.You're just a young kid.What are you doing here?

go right back to bed after breakfast.-Am I right?
-So what?May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?For chrissake.Cigarettes.Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times......that time spent in the company of others
is very therapeutic......whiIe time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.You remember that, don't you?Do you mean to say......it's sick to wanna be
off by yourself?CHESWICK:
Miss Ratched?Mr. Cheswick, you sit down.-But l wanna know about--
RATCHED: Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.I wanna---Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?
-It's my last one.That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?HARDlNG:
Look, l'm not running a charity ward, see?Come on.Look, l don't want his cigarettes,
and l don't want his or his or his......or his or his or his
or his or his, or even yours.Do you understand that?.
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched.I want my cigarettes.
I want mine, Miss Ratched.What gives you the damn right......to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk......and to squeeze out a pack

think they gotta keep their dignity.There's nothing worth doing
a man can do to keep his dignity.Human frame ain't built that way.When I'm not governor anymore
because I'm president......I wanna meet somebody at midnight,
I'll do that then too.Hope you leave me
to get a night's sleep.No, Jack, you going with me
because that's what you want.Yeah, you and Sugar
with me in the White House.I'll give Sugar a pistol range
right out there in the garden.Brace of Republican senators
can set up his tin cans for him.And I'm gonna appoint
a special member to Cabinet for you:Secretary to the Bedchamber
of Mr. Jack Burden.Somebody to keep them
telephone numbers straight......and return their little pink silk articles
that get left behind.But we gotta do this first.In the middle of the night when we
could just do it in town sometime.Sometime ain't never now.Bastard.Which way up there?Jack, tell Sugar
how to get to the house.It's your people live down here.Suppose he don't open up?Make him. What I pay you for?Hey, Jack.Mr. Duffy.This is Willie Stark
from up Mason City.- County treasurer.
- Glad to meet you.<i>- Jack Burden.
- From The Chronicle.</i>Good to meet you, Mr. Burden.Yeah, Willie's on business
for Mason City.Bond issue them got up there.Gonna build a schoolhouse.Yeah. Me and Willie
was in school together.Oh, you was in school, Alex.
I didn't know.Not the teacher's favorite,
I don't expect.No, sir, that's true.Willie was, though.
Still is, ain't you, Willie?Yeah, Willie married
a schoolteacher.Well, you know......they tell me that schoolteachers
are made with it......in the same place as the rest.Now, is that right or not, Mr. Stark?Yeah, that's right.Slade!Beers all around.Not for me, thanks.Oh, that little schoolteacher
don't like it when you drink?Well, she don't favor it, for a fact.Well, beers all around.Well, I sell beer
to those who want it.I don't make nobody drink them.Well, maybe you got some
orange pop for him.That's what he wants.Yeah, I think I'd like some orange pop.
Two straws.Jack, get up Mason City.See who's this fella
who thinks he's Jesus Christ......come down off the cross to scourge
the moneychangers......out of that shinplaster courthouse
they got them there.I know who he is.
Fella with a Christmas tie......pushed a school bond through.- You know him?
- Met him.Watched him drink
a bottle of orange pop once......through two straws on account
of a wife who don't favor drinking.She favor him
staying parish treasurer?Don't you know
how things are run up there?Run up there
like they're run down here.Yeah? Well, you leave down here
and run on up there.As a commissioner, as chairman,
I guess you're in a position......to know the situation
regarding the schoolhouse contract.Ain't no situation.Maybe not, but maybe so.Ain't any situation.Board took a bid offer.A.J. Moore's bid, the fella's name......schoolhouse gets built.This Moore fella's bid,
I take it, was the lowest?Now, you lookie here.Ain't nobody tells a board
what bid to take.Anybody can come along
put in a little pissant bid.Board doesn't have to take it.Board takes somebody
who can do the work right.Ain't nothing done but legal.Who was it
put in the little pissant bid?- Name of Jeffers, if I recollect.
- Jeffers Construction?- Yeah.
- Well, that's a real firm, a big firm.The board picks
who can do the work right.That's all I got to say.Don't you wanna tell mama......you wanna see yourself
shining in the table? No?All right. I wish I could have
sold some to you.Be out of your way in a second here.
And no brushes, you sure?- I'm sure.
- All right.Thank you.
Thank you for your time. Bye-bye.Mr. Stark.Why, Mr. Jack Burden,
how are you, sir?You know, people would think
parish treasurer paid well enough......a man wouldn't have to sell
household fix-it kits door-to-door.- People would think.
- Doesn't in Mason City.Well, I'm maybe not so good
at mathematics......as some other parish treasurers
you may've met.Or too good at it.How much they steal
on the schoolhouse contract?Well, let's see... .Jeffers come in $ 142,000.Moore, $ 175,000.That's $33,000 split six ways,
5500 per commissioner.They done it so plain and pretty, well,
you'd almost have to admire them.Just point out Jeffers
uses nigra laborers......skilled men, you know?Next thing, it's, ""Lookie here, nigras
making more money than you men.Pushing wheelbarrows,
hauling dirt.""And that's it. ""Goodbye, Mr. Jeffers
and your low bid.You go build your nigra schoolhouse
somewhere else.""Not that you didn't try and get people
to see what was going on.Oh, I yelled so long and loud about
these old boys lining they pockets......I'm lucky to have
any job in Mason City:Government, door-to-door,
or any other variety.I stood out there
on that street corner......pencil in one hand,
paper in the other......trying to show people
the numbers.But you stop people out there
in that hot sun......try to show them arithmetic......well, they can't see it so clear......through the sweat pouring in they
own eyes from they own hard labor.Especially if you put nigras
in the equation.- Why, you're likely to get beat up.
- Likely?Once or twice.You gonna run again in November?No, I'm done. A lame duck. Lucy too.
They got her fired from teaching.And I don't care. I don't want to teach
there just so they can steal money.That's right. You're looking at your
own private two-person leper colony.Sipping pop.So, what are you gonna do, then?I don't know. String my pa a fence,
slop some pigs, milk some cows.I'm gonna keep the faith, Mr. Burden,
that's what I'm gonna do.I'm gonna keep the faith
in the people, because you know why?Time......brings all things to light.I trust it's so.Joe.Did you get a photograph of him?Who?The next mayor of this town.You know what people are saying?People are saying
that God himself had a hand......in this schoolhouse business.That God stepped in
on Willie Stark's side.Yes, sir. He does work
in mysterious ways sometimes.Sometimes......he has somebody else do it.Sends over a fat man in a striped suit
with a big car to do his will.Well, I have had
some worse employers, I admit that.What you want?Well, I wanna work for you,
Mr. Stark.And you wanna work for the people,
unless I been misinformed.People vote me,
I'd be privileged to serve them.- What, as the county treasurer?
- Yes, sir.Mr. Stark, you could run
for mayor of Mason City......and you could win without climbing
out of bed in the morning.You just put the word out......about Willie Stark, who tried to take
on the crooks single-handed......Willie Stark,
who tried to warn us......Willie Stark, who could have saved
our kids if we'd have just listened.Now, I'm not talking about Willie Stark
for the mayor of Mason City. No, sir.I'm talking about Willie Stark......as the next governor
of the great state of Louisiana.Now, you saw a man
holding out a handful of cash to you......and you said no.This is what I see.I see a man in a booth......Iooking down at a ballot,
a working man.And he sees three names there:
Harrison, MacMurphy and Stark.Now, what this man really sees......is that picture in the newspaper
of them three little coffins......and the one man since
the great Governor Stanton died......that had the guts to buck the powers
that killed them.Now, that man, that voting man,
he's got a pencil......he checks a box,
you wake up governor.And that little lady lying
beside you......the one that don't favor liquor......she wakes up the governor's wife.That's what I see.Now, why don't you take a minute
with your orange pop......see if you can't see it too......governor.You got your speech?All right.Willie Stark!Thank you, folks.Thank you kindly.My name's Willie Stark
from Mason City yonder......and I'm pleased to have a chance
to talk with you all here today.Now, friends......what I wanna talk about is
something that's been troubling me.- Coffee, please.
- Yes, ma'am.Can I sit with you?Or anything else.No, thanks.- You don't like my looks?
- I don't care about anybody's looks......but I can't recall
ever going for anyone......who reminds me
of a box of spilled spaghetti.Miss Burke, I'm sitting here
having a cup of coffee.I'm almost through,
then you couldn't sit with me......which is what you asked for.
- Sorry.Not working
for Sen-Sen Puckett anymore.- Now, he wasn't a bad-Iooking fellow.
- Heel.Well, sure, politically and elsewise.Who didn't know that?I guess I'm slower on some things
than others.- Like you.
- Am I?- I think so.
- I think not.Not on this charade.That's the topic of the interview.Then tell me, if you're so smart.All right. Harrison's a city man,
MacMurphy's a cracker.Not a cracker precisely,
but enough of one to worry Harrison......that crackers won't know
the difference.So Harrison looks for someone
to split the cracker vote.Hears about an honest man
up in Crackerville......where some cracker kids go down
with a fire escape......that was supposed to be stuck with
more than spit to their schoolhouse.Sends his man Tiny Duffy up there
to romance him......and then Sadie Burke
to romance him some more.Both telling him how good he is......how he has better than a chance
in hell to change things in this state......where nothing will ever change.Because you and Tiny
and the rest of them......don't care how much of a fool
you make a man.And you do care, I suppose?I didn't say that. I don't care.If I did, I'd do something about it,
wouldn't I?No, I'd rather watch from here.Like passing a car crash.I know you all can't see this
from all the way back there......but I've got a pie chart
representing it.And you can see here where
public welfare and hospitals end up.They should be the same.Rather, the ratio... .We should go.Not yet.Let's go in again.You don't wanna swim?How you think we doing?Fine, I guess.You think?That how you reporting it?Sure.Seems to me they listen less and less
the further I get from home.Well, that makes sense,
don't you think?Maybe......you trying to say too much.I'm telling them
what they need to know:Taxes, wages, highways.Well, maybe it's how
you're telling them.Maybe if you told them
the way you tell Lucy or Tiny or me......or anyone face to face,
they'd listen better.I don't know how that is.Hard to know how you sound
to somebody else.Mad, fed up, like you mean business
is how you sound.But not on the platform.
You climb three steps......you sound like the rest of them. Like
a man who wants to win an election.Willie... .Yeah?What?Nothing.Well, a man don't have to be governor.I don't deny wanting it.I won't lie to you,
I lie awake wanting it.But sometimes a man
can want something so bad......be so full of want......he plain forget what it is he want.I could have been a good governor.A lot better than them other fellas.But I ain't gonna be governor.Hi.Come on in. Why not?Oh, Mr. Stark.Sadie.What's up?Willie here was just telling me
how he's not gonna be governor.You told him?No, I didn't, as a matter of fact, no.Told me what?Told me what?Oh, yeah, well, that makes sense.I see.So that's true? I'm being used.So they tell me.I saw it in his eyes the first time
he come to see me, Tiny.But I just pushed it out of my head.Pushed it clean out.I should've known better.Mr. Stark?Mr. Stark?You thought you were the little
white lamb of God, didn't you?Just waiting for the chance to stand
on your hind legs and make a speech.They would have paid you
to play the part. They pay me.But you were too stupid
to see even that.You did it for free.You're just their dumb sacrificial sap
and I'm... .I'm sorry I let them.Your stomachaches, your colics,
your bloats, your diarrhea.You're looking a little peaked.I can't imagine.Slept like a baby.Got your speech?All right, then. Let's go. It's time.""Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here.""What?The song.Yeah. That's what it is.Hello. Hello.How are you?Here's that speech
you was just asking about.My name is Willie Stark
from Mason City yonder.I had a speech......about this state and what it needs.There's no use in me telling you
about it, you are the state.You know what you need.Look at the knees of your pants.Look at your crops.Look at your kids.You got holes and rot......and ignorant offspring
on account of this state.Well, I had a speech,
but I ain't got it no more.Mr. Duffy got it now
in his fat little hands.Don't you, Tiny?Go ahead, show the people.
Hold it up.Well, since he got it......I'm gonna have to say
something else.It's all right.Because I got something else
to say.I got a story about a redneck hick.He's like yourselves, if you please.Well, this fella, a while back,
this hick......started thinking about
all the other hicks......what he could do for them.Well, one day......it came down
with the powerful force......of God's own hand......when the only brick schoolhouse
ever built in his parish......collapsed on account of it was built
with politics-rotted brick.And it killed and mangled
a batch of poor, young scholars.Oh, you know this story.You heard it.He fought the politics
that built that schoolhouse......with rotten brick and bolts.But he lost.He lost.And it fell.It fell.Well, it wasn't long......before some public officials
from the city......rode out in their big fine car......and told this hick how they
wanted him to run for governor.Them in them striped pants,
they told me......MacMurphy was a limberback......Joe Harrison, he was just a tool
of the city machine.And they wanted this nobody,
do-gooder hick......to step in,
give them some honest government.You know who they were?In that big fine car?They was Joe Harrison's
own lickspittles......coming in to split MacMurphy's
hick vote!That's right! Your hick vote!There he is!There he is right there.There's the Judas Iscariot lickspittle
nose-wiper from the city, right there.Come on, Tiny. Look at him.
Joe Harrison's dummy.Come on, take a bow. Come on. No,
come on now, people wanna see you.Take a bow, come on.
There he goes.No! No, let him lie! Let him lie!Let that hog lie in his own filth!Let him lie,
but listen to me, you hicks.That's right, I'm not the only one here.
You hicks too.They fooled you, too, just like
they fooled me a thousand times.But it's time I fooled somebody.It's time I fooled them.Them big-city, striped-pants lickspittle
hick-haters.I'm running for governor on my own.I'm coming for them
and I'm coming for blood!First thing I'm gonna do
is build me a road out......across the swamps and alligators
and anything else that gets in my way.A thousand miles of concrete,
if that's what it takes......so I can come out here and visit with
my fellow hicks on a regular basis.Then I'm gonna build me a bridge
across that mighty Mississippi.Name it after myself
because I'm the one who built it.Then I'm gonna build you all
new schools.Send your kids home with free tablets
and pencils and books......to study and learn on the way
to the new university I'm gonna build......where every one of them can go.Same as rich folks' kids.Now, I hope you're listening,
you hicks.Because I don't wanna drive
all the way back home......just to drive back out here
next week to tell you again.And this is it:If you don't vote......you don't matter.
You don't matter!You don't matter!And then you're just as ignorant
as them in the city say you are......while they stealing food
off your table......and every nickel out your pocket,
saying, ""Thank you.""Because then you are just a bunch
of ignorant hicks who got nothing......because you deserve nothing.So listen to me.Listen here.Lift your eyes......and look on the God's blessed
and unflyblown truth:You are a hick and ain't nobody
never helped a hick but a hick hisself.It's up to you
to nail these parasites up.- Up to you and me and God.
- Amen!- Nail up Joe Harrison!
- Nail him up!- Nail up MacMurphy!
- Nail him up!And nail up any bastard
that gets between you......and the roads and the bridges
and schools......and the food you need.You give me the hammer
and I'll do it.I'll nail their hides to the barn door.- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!More about Stark?He's colorful. Makes it easy.You know me,
always looking for easy.<i>Jack. You know what
The Chronicle line is on the election.</i>Sure. MacMurphy again because of his
brilliant record as an administrator......and high integrity as a statesman.Why can't you put that in your column,
a little less of Stark's raving madness?Listen, Jack.
I know Stark's a friend of yours but--He's not a friend of mine. Personally,
I don't care who's governor.Are you telling me what to write,
or am I mistaken?<i>- You know The Chronicle line.
- All right.</i>What do you mean, ""All right""?I mean it the way I said it.I, Willie Stark, do solemnly swear......that I will support the constitution
and laws of the state of Louisiana.<i>Willie didn't need me
to get himself elected.</i><i>He won by a landslide.</i><i>By the biggest margin in the history
of the state.</i>- All the duties incumbent upon me
as governor so help me God.<i>Which isn't to say
everyone voted for him.</i>Jack, get up Mason City.<i>My editor didn't vote for him.</i>- Thinks he's Jesus Christ
come down off the cross... .<i>The publisher of this paper
didn't vote for him.</i><i>These men didn't vote for him.</i><i>Or these.</i>The governor's education bill
does not pass.<i>Or the old boys in the Senate who
were in the pockets of the oilmen.</i><i>My mother didn't vote for him.</i><i>This is my mother.</i><i>She doesn't vote.</i><i>Over there, on her dressing table...</i><i>... that's her with her first husband.</i><i>First of four, if I recollect.</i><i>And that's my godfather on the right,
the best man.</i><i>He didn't vote for Willie either.</i><i>In fact...</i><i>... I think it's safe to say nobody from
where I'm from voted for Willie Stark.</i><i>And why should they?</i><i>His promises to the poor...</i><i>... to build roads and bridges
and schools...</i><i>... were a declaration of war
on the rich.</i><i>They wanted him out.</i>You Jack Burden?I've come at the behest of the boss.Who?The boss? The governor?Governor, let me put it in simple words
so you understand:There's no money for all these things
you wanna do for the poor.Oh, there's money, senator.You're wrong there.
There's plenty of money.Every kilowatt comes out of the river,
every barrel of oil from the ground.But that doesn't belong to you, sir.That's right. Don't belong to you either
or them. Belongs to the state.How about the state don't tax just 5%
to build my roads, we take it all?These are some powerful companies
you talking about taking money from.- They ain't gonna stand for it.
- They ain't the power.The power's in the hands
of the powerless......and those hands
have handed it to me.Realistically, they'll approve
half the money, maybe.And that's after we beat them up.So we build them half a highway.Mile of concrete, mile of dirt,
mile of concrete, mile of dirt......all the way to Shreveport.Now, how's anybody gonna drive
on that?People ain't gonna stand for that.They like their roads finished.That's right.What's right?Hey, Jack. Sadie, take Tiny
out of here, explain it to him.- He just said it and he don't get it.
- Come on, Tiny.- You want something to eat?
- No, thank you.- Well, sit down.
- Hi, Sadie.Hey.I heard you got fired.Oh, you heard wrong. I quit.That's smart. When I get done with that
outfit, they won't be able to pay you......nor the nigra
who sweeps the floor.- You want a job?
- Working for whom?- The state?
- Hell, no.Me.You, me, Sadie, Tiny.Tiny? I was surprised to hear
Tiny was back.Well, somebody gotta be
lieutenant governor.Yeah, sure.I keep Tiny around......to remind me of something
I never wanna forget.And that is?When they come around
sweet-talking, don't listen.Never again.What would I be doing for you?Sweet-talking.All right, everybody.What on earth is that?- This is a ballista.
- A what?Jack will tell you all about it.
Jack, come on. Tell them.It's a pre-gunpowder weapon
fired with the tension of animal sinew.Oh, my God.Jack?Right. See the eagle
on top of the clock?One......two... .They say you're in politics,
Mr. Burden?It must be fascinating
to be in politics.It's not, I assure you.Well, they say
you're very influential.It must be fascinating
to be very influential.I honestly wouldn't know.Don't let him kid you, Miss DuMonde.
My godson Jack is very influential.Like when he was a newspaperman.All right, then, yes, I'm influential.Any pals in the pen anyone
wants pardoned, I'll put in the word.Well, there is gonna be
somebody in the pen.Before it's over,
what's going on there?All these wild goings-on.Fella giving away the state.
Free this, free that, free the other.Every wool-hat jackass
thinking the world is free.Who's gonna pay?
That's what I wanna know.Who's he think's gonna pay?Standard Oil and the utility companies,
I imagine.And anyone else that can afford
to pay their share.You and me, George. We'll pay.Government's committed
these days......giving services
we never heard of back when.And he's gonna tax this state to death.
Drive business right out.You don't think it boils down to this:If the government,
for quite a long time now......had done anything
for the people......they wouldn't have got fed up
and elected Mr. Stark.Well, you ask him this
next time you see him:Ask him how much grabbing there is,
all that money flowing.Then you ask him what's he gonna do
when they impeach him.There's a constitution in this state......or was, before he blew it to hell.- I'll be sure to ask him.
- You do that.Jack, Miss DuMonde plays the piano.That's nice.You weren't like yourself today, son,
like you used to be.Mother, if I'm ever like I used to be,
do me a favor and shoot me.Who was that at lunch anyway?Mr. Peyton.
You've known him all your life.He builds electrical plants
or some such.The girl, Mother. Miss DuMonde.That's Mr. Orton's sister's child
and she will inherit his money.Somebody ought to wait
until she inherits it, then marry her......and drown her in her bathtub.Oh, don't worry,
I'd like to drown her but I won't.Was Mr. Peyton saying
those people you're with......are mixed up in some sort of graft?Graft's what you call it
when who's doing it......doesn't know which fork to use.
- Well, whatever you call it.- Because I worry to think that--
- I don't know.How would I, careful as I am not
to know what anybody anywhere......is doing at any time?Oh, Jack, make a note.Find out where they got
Senator Tucson's boy locked up.- What's his name?
- The boy? Hell, I don't remember.Find out when's the trial,
get a lawyer down there.- Who? Evans?
- Not Evans.Find somebody
with less oil in his hair......and don't look like he sing
with a band.Put one of your pals on it.You have any idea who it was got cut?I don't care if it was the sainted aunt
of the Apostle Paul.Well, I just happen to know.Fella's son of a doctor, paper said.They're pretty important around here,
you know, a doctor in the country.They think they're somebody.And maybe it gets out you're
trying to fix it to get the boy off.Wouldn't do you any good.- Now, it appears to me, maybe--
- You don't know a goddamn thing.Had you been listening......I told Jack to prime
the lawyer through a pal.Find somebody who don't need to
see his name in lights.That way, nobody knows
who picked him wasn't me.Might as well been the pope
himself far as anybody knows.All right.I get you.Yeah, just barely.- Hey, there, Pop.
- How you doing, son?- How you making out?
- Oh, I'm getting along.Good to see you.
You looking good.- I brought the infantry here.
- How are you?- More prettier than ever.
- Hey, Grandpa.How you doing, buddy?
How's the arm?- He gonna be all-American.
- I know he is. I know he is.All right, governor, sir, here we go.
One, two... .Bastard.Give me a slug.Pa don't favor drinking.Used to be Lucy didn't favor it.I don't know what she do
or don't favor no more.Not that it matters.Yeah, I must have poured 10,000
gallons of swill in them troughs.Still doing it. Pouring swill.Some things never change.Hey.- What's up?
- Judge Irwin.Judge Irwin what?- Spill it.
- I'll spill it when I have my breath.You're using it up
explaining you don't have it.You think it's funny?
You won't when I tell you.- You tell me later.
- Byram rang up.He said the afternoon papers
have got the judge saying......the allegations warrant
a full-on investigation.Two-timing bastard.That two-timing bastard.Clear them out.Tiny was figuring
on having supper up here.Clear them all out.Which way up there?Jack, tell Sugar
how to get to the house.It's your people live down here.Suppose he don't open up?Make him. What I pay you for?- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Jack.Jack?Well, I'll be.Hey, come on in.You're not in any trouble, are you?No, Jack's not in any trouble.Matter of fact, he doing all right,
all things considered.I trust you don't mind
if Jack pours me a slug.I didn't know his duties
ran to those of manservant......but if I'm mistaken, I'm sorry.
- Oh, hell.Sometimes Jack pours me a drink,
sometimes I pour him one.Sometimes I pour myself one.I could pour you one.No, thank you.This today's?Yeah, I don't get much time
to read the papers......rushing around the state
doing the good work.Well, perhaps, I can relieve
your curiosity on one point.Somewhere in there's my opinion
on the severity......of the allegations against you,
if that's of interest.Somebody told me that.But you know how rumor
hath a thousand tongues.And how them newspaper boys,
they can exaggerate some.It's no exaggeration.Yeah, I see.If you're clear on that
and finished with your drink......I'd appreciate it
if you'd just get out.Hey, thank you, judge,
I think I will have just one more spot.So I see it there in the paper,
and I hear you say it......but are you sure
you took it to the Lord in prayer?I settled it in my mind.See, that's unsettling.Because if I recollect right,
I recollect that......when we had our conversation
in town that time......you sort of felt like what MacMurphy
and his boys were saying about me......was beneath contempt.I made no commitment to you
or to them, only to my conscience.- I beg your pardon, your what?
- I beg yours.You been toiling around politics too
long to use a word like conscience......so easily.No, my change of conscience came
when certain features of your......public services, shall we say,
came to my attention.Somebody dug something up for you?
In the dirt?Yeah, not just one thing
and not very deep.Well, dirt's a funny thing.Ain't nothing but dirt on God's green
earth except what's under the water.And that's dirt too,
come to think of it.Dirt makes the grass green......let it breathe.The diamond on my wife's finger
ain't nothing but dirt got awful hot.What are we, but dirt blowed off
the hands of God almighty?You and me
and George Washington.And Jack there.Still doesn't alter the fact.I'm not trying to alter anything,
just illuminate it.Yeah.You saying MacMurphy and his bunch,
yelling for my impeachment......they're responsible,
law-abiding men?Yeah, they're responsible all right,
to Alta Power and oil companies......and the rest of them thieves.I wouldn't know about that.Only way to not know
is to not wanna know.I'm retired, Mr. Stark. A reporter
asked my opinion and I gave it.If you was retired, no reporter
would wanna ask you anything.What you say matters.A lot more than you pretend it don't.So I'm asking you......call off the dogs.Asking is different than telling
and that sounded like telling to me.Didn't it to you, Jack?You been a judge a long time.Yes, I have.How would it feel, do you think......to not be one no more?No man has ever been able
to intimidate me.I said what I said and I see no reason
to say or think anything different.Despite your expositions
on laws and men, sir.Suit yourself.You're right, Jack.
He don't scare easy.Judge, it's more in pain
than wrath I go.Let's go.
It's past Sugar Boy's bedtime.Your employer is calling you, Jack.I wouldn't go around
advertising this visit to anyone.In case you change your mind.Bastard.Well, Jackie,
you got a job cut out for you.- MacMurphy.
- No, the judge.You bring down the lion......the rest of the jungle will quake
in fear and they'll all fall into line.- I won't find anything.
- Oh, yes, you will.A man is conceived in sin
and born in corruption......and passeth from the stink of
the didie to the stench of the shroud.You'll find something.And make it stick.<i>Apart from pleasing the boss,
I could see little advantage...</i><i>... in finding anything beyond what
was already known about Judge Irwin.</i><i>What was known
was that he was kind to you...</i><i>... when your father left you
and your mother without saying why.</i><i>What was known
was that he taught you...</i><i>.... the things your father
should have:</i><i>How to be a gentleman.</i><i>How to firmly shake a hand.</i><i>How to safely load a shotgun
and lead a duck if you wanted to hit it.</i><i>What was known...</i><i>... was that he was more of a father
to you than your real father...</i><i>... who you didn't know at all.</i>Hold it, please.Governor's penthouse.How you doing digging
something up on Judge Irwin?Nothing.Nothing. Found nothing
or done nothing?There was nothing to find. I could
dig to China, wouldn't find anything.- And I'm not framing him.
- Framing?Ain't nobody talking about framing.That's never necessary.The truth is always sufficient.
You just find the truth.It's a waste of time and money.Jesus, doesn't anybody listen
to what I say anymore?You don't wanna do it, don't do it.
Or are you just looking for a raise?I'm gonna give you $ 100 raise
whether you want it or not.If I wanted more money, I'd make it.You gonna tell me
you work for me for love?I don't know why I work for you,
but it ain't for love or money.Well, that's right, it's not.And you don't know why.But I do.Why?Boy, you work for me
because I'm the way I am......and you the way you are......and that's just an arrangement
founded in the natural order of things.She sure could skate.Right now......hidden away in chambers......not out here in the open
like you and me......there's a legislature
full of hyena-headed......belly-dragging sons of bitches......setting around trying to figure out
how to impeach me.Now, they say it's because
I got crooks on the payroll.I say, ""Is that all?""Of course I got them.
I got a can of oil in the garage too......because there ain't a machine
made by man......don't need a squirt of that
from time to time just to keep running!But my crooks......unlike theirs......are all atremble......to be too crooked.They're itty-bitty compared
to their crooks in there.The Standard Oil
and the power companies.Besides, I got my eye on mine.Ain't nobody watching
over these crooks.Ain't nobody got their eye on them......while they rob
the resources of this state!Who made that son of a bitch
what he is? Who made him governor?And he goes and two-times me?
I'll kill him.No, he's two-timing Lucy.You need some other kind of
arithmetic for what he's doing to you.Lucy, she's a fool. She's... .- I don't know what.
- His wife.A hick with a college degree
from some Baptist hole in the ground.What was she like?- I didn't know Lucy any further back--
- The slut on skates.I don't know,
I was looking at her skates.Sure you were.- Was she pretty?
- Look, just forget it.How young was she?- Who cares?
- Look at me.He'll be back.
The world is full of sluts on skates.Skates, grass skirts, geisha outfits.Contortionists.<i>Every man a king
Every man a king</i><i>For you can be a millionaire</i><i>But there's something
Belonging to others</i><i>Well, there's enough
For all people to share</i><i>When it's sunny June

Savannah money.The daughter of an industrialist
out there.<i>He's clean, Willie.
He's washed in the blood.</i>- You call yourself a detective.
- I'm most certainly not--The son of a bitch
is washed in whitewash!- Wanting it isn't the same as being it.
- I know!- I can feel it.
- That isn't the same either.Where did you find this itty-bitty out?Hall of Records. It's all there.Marriage licenses,
property deeds, public record.The public record is for the public,
not us. That's why it's called that.You ain't gonna find nothing there!Now, I told you to dig,
not scuff your shoe a little bit.- You gotta get out and talk to them.
- To whom?The public.The people who knew him.This was a long time ago.Well, look, he's still alive, isn't he?
Causing trouble.So you gotta chafe up your hands
a little, for chrissake......like the rest of us.Where the hell is everybody?<i>Whatever there was to find
in the case of the upright judge...</i><i>... would be long-buried
in the past...</i><i>... like a dead cat in the back yard.</i><i>But what could be buried there
like that...</i><i>... in a place like Burden's Landing?</i><i>Where you and your friends
grew up...</i><i>... shaded
by 300-year-old live oaks...</i><i>... and the sense
of your own entitlement.</i><i>To dig around that past
in that back yard...</i><i>... you must first- - You tell yourself.
- seek out the girl from that past:</i><i>Anne Stanton.</i><i>The daughter of the governor
back then.</i><i>The little sister
of your best friend, Adam...</i><i>... who, one day, you noticed...</i><i>... and it struck you
kind of all of a sudden...</i><i>... wasn't little anymore.</i><i>She was the first one
you loved like that.</i><i>And the last, it turns out.</i><i>So you hold on to her pictures
in your mind...</i><i>... year after year...</i><i>... in the belief that someday
it'll be like that again...</i><i>... even though
you have no evidence.</i><i>In church, they call this faith.</i><i>So that's what I'll call it.</i>Every month or so,
I come out here and light a fire.Dry the place out.I know it doesn't really
accomplish that......but I got a feeling if I didn't,
if nobody ever came......the place would just one day
cave in on itself.Adam never comes out?No. Not anymore.He took the piano, or someone did.Took it and put it in that place
he's living. Have you seen it?God forbid my brother
ever spent any money on himself.Or that people knew it.How's your wife?I'm sorry, I've forgotten her name.That didn't quite work out
as I'd hoped.A lot of tangled bedclothes
and unspoken loathing......then spoken loathing
and no tangled bedclothes.Didn't I read of your engagement
in the society column?Which you know
I always turn to first in the paper.I was engaged. More than once.Adam didn't care for any of them.- Why that should matter, I don't know.
- Who needs them, anyway?Anne, way back,
was Judge Irwin ever broke?What?Judges don't make
the kind of money your father did......or my father,
or anyone who lives here.Why on earth would you want
to know such a thing?- Someone asked me and I didn't know.
- Asked you what?What I just asked you.Why?Oh, Jack,
what are you doing for that man?- That man.
- Whatever it is, don't.That man is what those pushed
away from the trough call him.Those invited to it
should find another name.Accepting state money
for scholarships......is different
from being on his payroll.- Is it?
- Yes, it is.- Oh, don't ruin it.
- What?Don't ruin this?Or that fine, beautiful time
we all had here once?You sure that's what it was?- Yes.
- Then why did it turn into this time?With me drinking myself to death......Adam getting more reclusive
and strange......and you once a month coming out
to a house with the electricity cut off?This time came from that time.We should go.The fire can burn.It will anyway, you know, one day.What will what anyway?Cave in on itself.Everything.Is the Seaboard Bank in Savannah?Not since 1938.What happened in '38?Bought out by Georgia Fidelity.Got any idea
who was president then?Franklin Roosevelt.Ma'am, of the bank.LeMoyne Carruthers was my friend.A dear friend.And his daughter, Mabel,
well, I did what I could for her......even after her financial reversal.The year of her financial reversal
was roughly what?She threw that inheritance away.Two or three notes I paid myself.For the memory of LeMoyne,
my dear friend.But she'd come back at me without
shame and say, ""I want money.""For parties and balls
and to adorn herself.For she was plain, to be kind.Then she was broke
when she met the judge.So was he. This is when
he was still attorney general......under Governor Stanton
pulling down 3400 a year......while paying off liens on his place
on the Row to the tune of 42,000.Well, you see there,
you are a detective.You dug and chinked
the metal box......and are enjoying the sound of it
a bit, if I'm not mistaken.Might still be empty.No, it's full.Crawling with maggots
by now, maybe......but still a little something they was
chewing on. Just have to look.Still have to find the key.
And that ain't gonna be easy.Well, there's nothing easy
that means anything.You'll do it. I have faith.I like this one, Slade.Now, they all is yelling that I got
no right to what's on their table.What's on their table is theirs.I'm not trying to take it.""Go ahead, sit down at that table,""
I tell.""Have all you want to eat.
Eat till you can't eat no more.Now, what's left on that table......when you can't eat no more,
even if you tried......leave that there
because that's for the rest of us.""And for that, they're trying to ruin me.For taking
what they left on the table......and using it
to build something for you!To build 3000 miles
of paved highways......a hundred and eleven new bridges,
208 new schools......60,000 brand-new jobs!Now, they wanna ruin me......because they wanna ruin you.But your will is my strength.Your need is my justice.And I won't let them!It come to me in a dream.Whilst you were up in Savannah with
your pail and shovel, eating oysters.What did?I'm gonna build me
the best-staffed, best-equipped......biggest goddamn health center
this state ever saw.This country ever saw.
The All-Father hisself.You want me to do what
to further this noble enterprise?Deliver me my chief of staff.Fine. You give me a list
of who you're thinking to run it.Only one name on it:Dr. Adam Stanton.That's my boy, Tom! That's the way!
You see that?That's an all-American pass.
Goddamn it. Attaboy, Tom!Well, somebody gotta
run this hospital.He's gotta be the best, don't he?- Adam Stanton is not the best.
- Well, he is for what I need.They'll never approve
the money otherwise.Willie, Adam's an old friend of mine.As I certainly know,
else I wouldn't be asking.I know him and I know you.
He won't do it.What's wrong with me?To him, what isn't?You're everything
his father fought against.He hates what you represent,
if not you yourself.I'm not asking him to love me.- I'm asking him to run a hospital.
- Your hospital.The people's hospital, where any poor
redneck and nigger can get the best......without paying a dime.
He ought to like that.No. What you're asking is for him
to put his family's name next to yours.So you can trot him out
in front of senators and say:""Lookie here,
lookie who I got standing next to me.The son of the most honorable man
who ever served this state.""Just get him.Not easy being the son
of a great man.It don't look so hard
for my boy Tom out there.Far as you know.We should go.Not yet. Let's go in again.<i>The friend of your youth...</i><i>... is the only friend you'll ever have.</i><i>For he doesn't really see you.</i><i>He sees in his mind a face,
which doesn't exist anymore.</i><i>And speaks a name- -</i><i>Spike, Bud, Red, Rusty, Jack.</i><i>- that belongs
to that now nonexistent face.</i><i>He's still the young idealist
you used to be.</i><i>Still sees good and bad
in black and white...</i><i>... and men as sinners or saints,
but never both.</i><i>- Hey, Adam.
- Feels superior in the knowledge....</i><i>... that you no longer
can distinguish the two.</i><i>- Jack.
- That's what drives you to it...</i><i>- ... try to stick the knife in.
- Come on in.</i><i>For there's a kind
of snobbery in failure.</i><i>Like the twist
to the mouth of a drunk.</i>You're looking good, Jack.Thank you.
I'll take that as a compliment.Been playing much?Who wants to know, my sister?It was just a question.- Everything good?
- Yes, Jack, everything's good.All right.
I'm gonna tell you something.I don't want you to start yelling at me
until I'm finished.Governor Stark
wants you as director......of the medical center he's building.
Whatever you want......all you have to do is say,
it's yours.- Money?
- I didn't say that.What do I want money for?
I got everything I want. Look around.I didn't say money.Then what?
What's next when that doesn't work?- A threat of some kind?
- Of course not.That's how he gets things done?
What he relies on?The bribe and the threat?I would never do that to you
or let anyone else. You know that.I don't know what you think
he's thinking, Jack......or what you're thinking,
but couldn't be flattery.He's thinking what he thinks about
anybody he wants something from......who doesn't wanna give it.
- Something from their past.- You just said he wasn't.
- Not their past, their weakness.- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.I'm not gonna debate it with you, Jack.
We're not in school anymore.I don't care if you know I'm right.
I don't care if I am right. But I am.Then what is it, Jack?
What is my weakness?You can't look at anybody
with something broke......without wanting to fix it.- And that's a weakness?
- Some would say.You would say.- It's no disgrace.
- Well, then tell me, Jack.Tell me, please.
How is that a weakness?- I don't need to tell you.
- I think you do.If you don't know, I'll leave you
to think about it. It'll come to you.No, it won't, Jack.
And you'll have to go to your boss......and tell him you failed
without taking out the big guns.So tell me, for your sake,
how is that a weakness?Because it makes you do things
you don't wanna do.If they're good.And this is. He may not be......but this is.It was good to see you, Adam.Now, before I tell y'all the story
about how this great university......changed the life of a boy
from Mason City......who, by all rights,
should still be swilling hogs......first, I'm gonna set your minds at ease
on another point of interest.I brung my checkbook with me.- You own one share?
- I do. I just bought it.Now, that gives me the right
as a stockholder......to view the company's
equity records, doesn't it?Governor, sir?Miss Littlepaugh?You're from the insurance company.No, no, I'm not.But I know about your brother's
insurance policy.Not that there was much left on it
to collect.He borrowed against it
almost down to nothing. Didn't he?Which means you lied......for almost nothing.Now, don't you go
jumping out a window.It wasn't the money......it was the disgrace.I wanted him buried in the good part
of the cemetery......not in the back,
with all the sinners.Why did he kill himself?They drove him to it.
To make room for that thief, Irwin.My brother went
to the Justice Department......and told them he knew
all about their man Irwin......and the bribes......but they wouldn't listen.- Are you lying to me?
- No, that's what killed him.He wrote the letter to me
and told me.And then that night he... .All right, wait. What letter?The letter he wrote me
explaining it all.The lawsuit Irwin was paid
to let up on......and how the power company
hid the payoffs......by firing my brother
and giving Irwin his job.Where's the letter now?
What happened to it?Oh, I have it.Kept it all this time?You have the letter here?<i>You bring down the lion...</i><i>... the rest of the jungle
will quake in fear...</i><i>... and they'll all fall into line.</i>Your employer is calling you, Jack.Thank you.Hello.Hello, Anne.- What's that?
- Orange soda.Two straws.- I think I might want something else.
- I didn't say one of them was for you.It's the way it's drunk. Tradition.- I know you went to see Adam.
- I did. What of it?What did you say to him?I went there and I offered him a job.
No use blaming me.- I'm not blaming you.
- Well, that's what it sounds like.That's what you sound like.
If you could hear yourself.I want him to take it.
I want you to go back......and ask him again.Jack, you know how it is.
My brother is the son of a governor......the grandson of a senator,
the great-grandson of a general.<i>She wasn't telling me anything
I didn't already know about Adam.</i><i>But she was doing it
walking next to me...</i><i>... which is all that mattered.</i><i>So I let her go on
as long as she wanted.</i><i>I knew that Adam
had already made his decision.</i><i>He had decided to take the job
when I first brought it up.</i><i>He was just putting some time
between my visit and now...</i><i>... out of pride.</i>He needs to do this
to be part of something himself......before he disappears.<i>But something about
what she was saying bothered me.</i><i>The way an off-stage noise
bothers you.</i>What kind of life is that?<i>Something you hear- -</i>He's a guardian of dead men.<i>- but not clear enough
to catch the meaning of.</i>I want him to take it.
He has to do it.<i>So you push it aside.</i>I guess that's one of your gunmen
I've heard about.Sugar Boy, hell, no.He just carry that peashooter
for decoration.I tell you one thing, though.
Ain't nobody can drive like him.So, what do you think, doc?I think it'll do the people of the state
some good......and get you some votes.There's a lot of ways to get votes.
Cheaper ones.So I understand.Because there are some things
I understand.And some things you don't.
Just like there's some I don't.What I do know
is what makes the mare go.And that you can always
make goodness out of badness.- That would be two things.
- Them's the two things I know, then.And both of them wrong.No, neither one of them, sir.
I beg your pardon.You can always make good from bad,
in all things.In politics, poetry......everything in between.
Makes no difference.A man writes a sonnet......and it's good.Is it less good if it turns out......the dame he wrote it about
is married to someone else?That his passion was illicit?Come on,
I wanna show you something.I wouldn't mind
understanding something, actually.Lf, as you say, there's only bad
to start with from conception on......and that good must be made
from bad......then how do you ever know
what the good is?Well, that's simple.
You just make it up as you go along.Make up what?The good. What else
are we talking about?Make it up as you go along?Yeah. Just like folks have been doing
for a million years.Since we fall out of trees,
crawl out the swamp.They just cook up what is right.If nobody likes that, well,
just cook it up again......a little different with a lid on.And you know what?Things under a lid
don't look no different than things......not under a lid
when there's one on it.You don't have to convince me
of anything, Mr. Stark.You've already done that.
I'm here, aren't I?That's right.
And you're a good boy too, doc.A lot better than you think.So goddamn it.Don't let none of them bastards
tell you no different.I got a question since everybody's
trying to understand everything......all of a sudden.Back when we met......at Slade's old place,
when we shook hands--Do you remember that moment?Like it was yesterday.Did you or did you not
give me a wink?A wink?Well, that's just gonna have to remain
a mystery.- You don't remember.
- Sure I do.Then...?You know, I... .I just do recall giving you a wink.But then,
maybe I got something in my eye......which would make it more
of a blink.Did you have something
in your eye?What if I didn't?What would that mean?That maybe you figured
you and me......had something in common
the others didn't.Well, I'm not gonna tell you
and deprive you of the mystery.There's just too few honest-to-God
mysteries left to go around.And long after I'm dead and gone......and long after these sons of bitches
are dead and gone......I'm talking eternally now......the Willie Stark Hospital
will still be standing.Where every man,
woman and child......who's sick or in pain can go in......knowing they'll get
all a man can do.Not as charity,
but as a right, as your right!As it is that every child
shall have a complete education!That no person, aged or infirm,
shall want or beg for bread!That no poor man's land
or house will be taxed!That you shall not be deprived
of hope!And if any man......stands between me......and fulfilling your rights......I will strike him down......so help me God!Hip, shin, thigh and neck bone,
I will hit him.I will hit him with a meat ax.Somebody give me a meat ax......and bring me another one
for my friend and ally!Because it's not only God's only son
with us on this one.It's the son of the last
great leader of this state:Governor Joe Stanton's boy,
Dr. Adam Stanton!All right. See there?It's not so bad.
It's not gonna kill you.What's up?Sadie.Now he's done it.He's done it again,
and I swear this time... .- Done?
- Don't act so dumb.Or any dumber than you are.
He's two-timing me again.Or four or one or whatever timing
you wanna call it......because you're such a smartass.- She skate?
- Shut up.You and your friends.
Your highbrow friends.All the money and privilege
and everything else......you pretend means nothing.
To someone with it, it means nothing.Don't look so dumb.
I said it annoys me.I have no idea
what you're talking about......or what it was tangled you two up
in the first place, love or hate.You know what I'm talking about.Maybe you fixed it up.
I'm sure you did.Surely he's fixed you up,
like that pathetic......crazy brother of hers,
to say thanks.""Thanks, Jack.
She is a looker, I do declare.I'm naming you SDP,
yes, sir.State Director of Pimps.""What are you saying?Are you saying...?Thank you.Are you s--?<i>I love you.</i>We're gonna walk some more.All right.Hello.Hello, Mother.Yes, Mother. Yes.All right.All right, Mother.Goodbye.She and the Peytons
and the bridge partner......are going to La Grange
for a nightcap.- Jackie.
- What?I came up here.<i>This was years ago,

weren't set in concrete.</i><i>Back when you had a way

but never that.</i><i>We talked about love in general.</i><i>Like it was the subject of an essay
instead of real.</i><i>She said it was like jumping off
the high dive, love was.</i><i>Or like almost getting drowned.</i><i>Which, honestly,
I didn't understand.</i><i>For a long time.</i><i>You wanna know the reason
I stopped that night?</i><i>It wasn't nobility.</i><i>That's only what I told myself.</i>We have all the time
in the world, right?<i>It was that I knew something
was about to be taken from us...</i><i>... leaving in its place
something we didn't know.</i><i>Which didn't make her sad...</i><i>... but it did me.</i><i>You only get a couple of moments
that determine your life.</i><i>Sometimes only one.</i><i>And then it's gone.</i><i>Forever.</i>I talked to Senator Loden
this morning.He said you find something nice
to put on his plate......he might come around.
Vote any way you like.While you cut yourself a slice.- I ain't saying that.
- I know what you're saying, Tiny.You know, I'd rather bust a man
than buy him.- Well, that's up to you now.
- Yeah, sure is. Now go on. Get.Do you have
any information for me?You sure there's not something
you neglected to mention?Something you forgot?Jack.No.Nothing.Nothing. Well.How about that, Sugar? Nothing.
Am I alone in this?The bastards
are pounding at the gate......they're gonna put a vote
of impeachment on the calendar!They take that vote today, I'm out!I need Judge Irwin with me.Or at least not against me.So whatever it is......that you don't have on him......use it.I'm sorry, what did you say?I said I'm going over to the judge's.Well, you mean later.
He'll be napping this time of day.There isn't any time
he'll wanna hear......what I have to tell him.He's not well, you know.I can't help that.I do wish
you wouldn't get mixed up in things.It isn't me mixed up in them.The judge is napping right now,
Mr. Burden.I'll wait in his study
until he comes down.Fire this marble.Watch the chandelier.Okay, you can fire.Hello, Jack. I didn't know
you were at your mother's.- You just get in?
- Last night.Yeah. It's a bit early in the day,
but what do you think?A touch of bourbon
never hurt anyone.Least not you and me.We're indestructible, aren't we,
you and me?- No, thanks.
- ""No, thanks,"" he says.Begging the question,
as the old man pours just one drink......what's on your mind?Out with it.You know who I work for.How could I forget?But let's just sit
and pretend that I have.Come sit over here with me.The truth is I don't hold
the same low opinion of him......as many of our friends
on the Row.I was almost for him at one time.He was busting out windowpanes
and, yeah, letting in some fresh air.But now I am worried about him
knocking down the whole house.So you threw in with his enemies
after you said you wouldn't.Oh, Jack.What is politics
but a matter of choices?You make a choice knowing there's
a chance it's the wrong one.You've made a choice
and you know how much it's cost you.There's always a price
for everything we do.When we came by that night
and were leaving......you said you would think
about it.About calling off the dogs?
No, I did not say that.Your memory is faulty, sir.
He said, ""Think about it""......which I don't have to.I don't have to think
about things I already know.You should think it over.
Even now......because it's not too late.Too late for what?Hey, Jack.Jesus.- What is it?
- Just say you'll back Stark......against these attacks.
- No!Now, that has the sound of finality,
don't it?- Yes, it does.
- Yeah.You know,
I find this difficult to believe.For me too.And that your boss would even think
he could pressure me.Could blackmail me.- The first word is better.
- The first word is prettier, not better.Don't you know that this stuff
wouldn't stand up? Not in any court.It happened almost 25 years ago.You couldn't get any testimony......except from that woman
who is related......and whose testimony,
if she gave it......would be worthless.And everybody else, Jack......everybody else is dead.You're not.You're not dead.
And you don't live in any court.You live in the world, where people
think you're a certain kind of man.I am a certain kind of man.You know, when I was a kid
it seemed natural......that a grown man
would stay up nights with catgut......and steel wire, pliers and scissors,
and make little catapults.Read books about them.Will you change your mind?You know, I could hurt you, Jack.Like you're trying to hurt me.I could say something.I could tell you something......that would hurt.But I won't.Think it over. I'll be by tomorrow.My mind's made up now.I'll come back tomorrow.Made up now.Mother. Mother.- Mother. Mama.
- You! You! You did it!- What?
- You killed him!- Who?
- You killed him.- Mother, who?
- You killed him.- Who?
- You killed him!- Who, M--?
- You killed him! You killed him!- Who, Mother?
- Your father!You killed your father!""I am the resurrection and the life,""
saith the Lord.""He that believeth in me,
though he were dead......yet shall he live.Whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.""I know that my redeemer liveth......and that he shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.And though this body be destroyed,
yet shall I see God......and I shall see for myself......and mine eyes shall behold,
and not as a stranger.We brought nothing
into this world......and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.- The city of God, the holy place
of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.God is in the midst of her.Therefore,
shall she not be removed.- In every good work to do his will......working in you that which
is well pleasing in his sight......through Jesus Christ to whom
be glory forever and ever. Amen.I told you to scare him,
not scare him to death.- He wasn't scared.
- Then why did he do it?- Jack?
- I don't wanna discuss it.Well, let me just say this.I know that he was some kind of
friend of the family......growing up, all that, so I'm sorry
the old bastard shot himself......but we still got MacMurphy
and his boys to deal with.And that didn't work out
the way we hoped.You need to get someone else
for all of it. I'm through.Through with it or with me?I don't wanna discuss it.<i>After any great trauma or crisis...</i><i>... after the shock subsides
and the nerves stop twitching...</i><i>... you settle down
to the new condition of things...</i><i>... because you know that all possibility
of any more change...</i><i>... has been used up.</i><i>You've seen the pattern finally...</i><i>... because you've stepped back far
enough to take in the whole picture.</i><i>But it's too late now to do anything
but accommodate yourself to it.</i><i>And that's it.</i><i>There's nothing left to do or say...</i><i>... except that God and nothing
have a lot in common.</i><i>The end.</i><i>What you don't know
is that you're wrong.</i>Oh, God, Jack.You've gotta help me.He's crazy. He came to see me,
said the most terrible things. . ....and then he walked out.
- Who? Willie?No, Adam.He said it was my fault.- Everything was my fault.
- Well... .Someone called him......and told him......about me.About you?About you and the governor.
You can say it, Anne.It doesn't hurt any more to hear it
than to know it.He told him what I'd done......and he said that I'd do anything
to help the governor......get what he wanted.
Even if that meant......sacrificing my brother
to some kind of fraud.Which is all the hospital was.Nothing but a scheme to rob the state.And that when the truth came out......and it would,
Adam would take the blame.He'd go to prison. For every scheme
needs a fall guy and he's it.- Whoever said that is lying.
- I know.I tried to tell him that's not the way
it was. That he was wrong.But he wouldn't listen.He grabbed me and said
that he would not be made a fool.That everything else
could be filthy and corrupt......but that a man didn't have to be.And then he said that......he wouldn't be a paid pimp
to his sister's whore.He said that to me.Well, neither will I.Why did you do it?- You knew what it would do to me.
- It had nothing to do with you.- Then what?
- I don't know!- Well, you better think of something!
- I wasn't thinking--!Yes, you were! Yes, you were.Was it because of me
or in spite of me?I'd never hurt you like that.You would and you have.Oh, God, Jack.
You have to help me.I'm afraid Adam's gonna
do something to himself.Adam?Dear God, you are the unseen Lord
of this chamber...Dear God, you are the unseen Lord
of this chamber......the silent listener......the judge of our deliberations.<i>Bless the senators you sit among.</i><i>We place our trust
in your guidance.</i><i>You are our Lord and Savior.</i><i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i><i>All persons are commanded
to keep silent...</i><i>- ... on pain of imprisonment...
- Adam!</i>...while the Senate
of the state of Louisiana...<i>... sits for the trial
of the articles of impeachment...</i><i>... against the honorable William
Stark, governor of state of Louisiana.</i>I'll go up and make some calls.Anne......I'm sure it's gonna be fine.<i>- Mr. Gidré.
- Nay.</i><i>- Mr. Honoré.
- Yea.</i><i>- Mr. Hobbes.
- Nay.</i><i>- Mr. Landmark.
- Nay.</i>- Mr. Latché.
- Yea.- Mr. Mouton.
- Nay.- Mr. Pelerant.
- Nay.<i>- Mr. Rivette.
- Yea.</i>- Mr. Rousseau.
- Nay.- Mr. Savoir.
- Nay.<i>- Mr. Tesh.
- Nay.</i><i>Seventeen yeas, 22 nays.</i><i>The impeachment
of Governor Willie Stark fails.</i>There is a line between
what is acceptable and what is not.Now, the governor has stepped over
that line to guide this vote......using means
that are inappropriate.Now, I'll call that undue influence.I'll go further, I'll call it coercion.Mr. MacMurphy!You say every word
but the one you mean, sir!Go ahead, say it out loud.
We're all friends here.But I blackmailed nobody,
to be factual!I merely gave you
the opportunity to act......in accordance
with your own nature......and like all good men,
rise above principle.Jack!We did it! We did it, boy!
We stopped that clock!Ain't gonna be
no impeachment today!<i>Someone called him, Adam.</i>And said that I'd do anything to
help the governor get what he wanted.Even if that meant sacrificing
my brother to some kind of fraud.<i>Which is all the hospital was.</i><i>Nothing but a scheme
to rob the state.</i><i>Adam would take the blame.</i><i>He'd go to prison. For every scheme
needs a fall guy and he's it.</i><i>That's not true.</i><i>Whoever said that is lying.</i>Hey, doc. Where you been?
You been out there swimming?<i>So listen to me. Listen here...</i><i>... and lift your eyes...</i><i>... and look on the God's blessed
and unflyblown truth:</i><i>You are a hick and ain't nobody
never helped a hick but a hick hisself.</i><i>It's up to you
to nail these parasites up.</i><i>Up to you and me and God.</i>- Nail up Joe Harrison!
- Nail him up!- Nail up MacMurphy!
- Nail him up!And nail up any bastard
that gets between you......and the roads and the bridges
and the schools......and the food you need.
You give me the hammer and I'll do it."

The Apartment|1960|94|Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray, Ray Walston|Billy Wilder|"On November 1, 1959, the population
of New York City was 8,042,783.If you laid them all end to end, figuring
an average height of 5 feet 6 1/2 inches......they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.We're one of the top five companies
in the country.Our home office has 31,259 employees......which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.I work on the 19th floor.
Ordinary Policy Department......Premium Accounting Division,
Section W, desk number 861.My name is C.C. Baxter: C for Calvin, C
for Clifford. But most people call me Bud.I've worked here three years, ten months,
and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.The hours in our department
are 8.50 to 5.20.They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees......without a serious traffic jam.As for myself, I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour or two......especially when the weather is bad.It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It's just a way of killing time......until it's all right for me to go home.You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.I live in the West 60s,
just half a block from Central Park.My rent is $85 a month.
It used to be $80 until last July......when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,
put in a second-hand air conditioner.It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,
but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to.Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Mrs. Lieberman.Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.- Where does she live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.Such a racket I heard in your place.Maybe you had burglars?Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.Oh!I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.We discussed manpower promotionwise.
I told him you're a bright boy.They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans......last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?Cheese crackers?Cheers.- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich... including the toothpick.- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.- A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.- Could you do us a favor?
- Me?When you make out your will...
and the way you're going, you should......would you mind leaving
your body to the university?My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.Slow down, kid.Oh, for heaven...From the world's greatest library
of film classics, we proudly present......Greta Garbo, John Barrymore......Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore......in ""Grand Hotel"".But first, a word from our sponsor.If you smoke the modern way,
don't be fooled by phoney filter claims.And now, ""Grand Hotel""......starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore......Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore.But first, a word from our alternate sponsor.Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.I'm in this bar on 61 st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.That's very nice of you but... who is this?Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61 st and I think I got lucky.I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.She looks like Marilyn Monroe.I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.Ooh!Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.Yes, Mr. Dobisch.Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch!No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch!
Be my guest!We never close at Buddy-boy's.""Looks like Marilyn Monroe""!- This the place?
- Yeah.- How much?
- 70 cents.Get the money, will you?Watch those stingers!- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.Put it back, honey!Attagirl.- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.Barging in on your mother so late at night.Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.Get the key, will you?Not there! Under the mat.- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.Open up. We haven't got all night.- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.Mildred! He's at it again!- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.Good morning, Mr. McKellway,
Mrs Schubert, Mr. Davis.Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr. Baxter.- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.Watch the door, please. Blasting off.- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it. [snuffles]- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.- I never catch colds.
- Really?I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.I shoulda stayed in bed last night.19!Watch your step.- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!
- Pardon?One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...20 next!That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.Hello. Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.Oh, Buddy-boy!I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.It's not Picasso I'm calling about.It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.And I couldn't get into my apartment!So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.And about your promotion.I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.You may hear from him
before the day's over.Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.From Mr. Dobisch.Wait.For Mr. Dobisch.Mm-hm. Mm-hm.Vanderhof. Public Relations.Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.Look, I've got you down for tonight......but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.I got somebody penciled in.Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.- Mr. Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.Friday.Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18
percent ahead of last year Octoberwise.Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?You'd be doing me a great favor.Let me check. I'll get back to you.Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.Sylvia, it's for you.Yeah?Oh, hello.Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?Thursday?! Well, that's
The Untouchables with Bob Stack!Bob who?All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.All right. I'll tell him.Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?It's a bet!- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.27.You may not realize it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiencywise......and this may be the day promotionwise.You're beginning to sound
like Mr. Kirkeby already.- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.Something happens to men in elevators.It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.Or some evening, after work?- 27.
- Oh.- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.They would call me today,
what with my cold.- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.Thank you.I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.Good luck. And wipe your nose.C.C. Baxter, Ordinary Premium
Accounting. Mr. Sheldrake called me.I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.Come in, come in.I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.Been hearing some nice things about you.Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.- Mr. Dobisch said that?
- Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late......without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans......would both like you
transferred to their departments.Very flattering.Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?- I don't know.
- Think.- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.You do?In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.It turned out
he was running a bookie joint......tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.- The vice squad?
- That's right.What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.It's the key to a certain apartment.- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?Loyal, resourceful, cooperative
C.C. Baxter.- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.You'd better.Well......about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.One of the guys in our department... lives
in Jersey... had to go to a banquet in town.He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...How many charter members
are there in this little club?Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentagewise.That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbors, the landlady and the key.How do you work it with the key?I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.Yes, dear. Where were you?You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.I won't be home for dinner tonight.The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theater.Music Man. What else?No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen Music Man?Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.How would you like to go tonight?You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.Well... that's very kind of you.But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.So give the tickets to somebody else.Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.Swap 'em? For what?It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.Oh?Oh...That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.- I am?
- Now put down the key.And put down the address.It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.Yes, thank you, sir.You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.Oh, and about the liquor.I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?Percentagewise.Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.You too, sir.So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.- Good night.
- Good night.Oh! Miss Kubelik?I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognize you.This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.- Look, have you seen The Music Man?
- No.- Would you like to?
- Sure.We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.- You mean... like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...You tell 'em now and then.This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.I understand.Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theater ticket go to waste.- What time does the show go on?
- 8:30.Well, I could meet you at the theatre.That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.I'll meet you in the lobby.You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.Now along comes my promotion
and us... 11 th row centre.And you said I should've stayed in bed.- How is your cold?
- What cold?After the show we could go out
on the town. [hums dance tune]- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.There's a great band
at El Chico, in the Village.- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.Your sister and brother-in-law.I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.How come?A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.8:30!- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.Still afraid someone
might see us together?- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.You want a lock to carry in your wallet?- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.How long has it been, Fran? A month?Six weeks. But who's counting?I missed you.Like old times.Same booth. Same song.- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.""Good morning, Miss Kubelik.""
""Good night, Mr. Sheldrake.""I'm still crazy about you, Fran.Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.I don't believe you.Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.But that was it. Happens all the time.Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary......or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife......and the girl...They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.I never said goodbye, Fran.For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch......and asks you if any lipstick's showing......then rushes out to catch
the 7:14 to White Plains.So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee......and you sit there
by yourself and you think......and it all begins to look so... ugly.How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7:14 train?Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?I want you back, Fran.Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?- No. I have a date at 8:30.
- Oh?- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.Just bring us two more drinks, will you?Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.Do you remember what we talked about?- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.You didn't believe me, did you?They got it on a long-playing record now.
""Music to String Her Along By.""""My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me.""- That's enough, Fran.
- ""Trust me, baby. We'll work it out.""- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.- Handle what?
- What do you think?Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.Are you sure that's what you want?I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.You know I do.Fran.Jeff, darling...It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.Taxi!- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?- [Whistles]
- Where are we going?- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.51 West 67th.Congratulations.Would you mind? C.C. Baxter... that's me.Thank you.Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.Teamwork: That's what counts in this
organization. All for one and one for all.- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitudewise.- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... like that.We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!How selfish can you get?Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.I'm too old for that sort of thing...
I mean in a Volkswagen.I sympathize with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.I like the way you handled that, Baxter.- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that?
- Oh, no, no.I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.Yeah, I know how it is.You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.That's the life all right.- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.And I'll get that other key.- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.Yeah? Yeah?!Where?You bet!Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor! Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleighSo I said to him ""Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl.""Miss Kubelik? Miss...- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man......because you have a date
with another man.- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.I mean decencywise and... otherwisewise.Cheers.- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.Shall we join the natives?- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it.There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers......and punched full of little square holes.- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.Hi!How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.So you don't have to
play innocent with me.He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle......four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.And right before you was a Miss, um...Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.It's him. Oh, what a salesman!Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant......and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.Miss Kubelik!Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.Are you all right? What's the matter?Nothing. There are just
too many people here.Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.Do you mind?Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?- I like it.
- Really?You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.- Is that better?
- Much better.Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me......how about goin' out tonight...
you, me and the bowler?We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.You know Mr. Sheldrake?- Why?
- He and I are like that.Sent me a Christmas card. See?Makes a cute picture.I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?I think so. Here.It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.What's the matter?- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.Your phone.Yes?Uh, just a minute.- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.Yes, sir. Same to you.Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?The party's just starting.Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.Rum Collins.Uh...Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.You like Castro?I mean, how do you feel about Castro?- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?Cause as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.That so?All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.He's in Havana, in jail.- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.Well, you can't win 'em all.'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the houseNot a creature was stirrin'...Nothin'. No action.Dullsville.- You married?
- No.- Family?
- No.A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years......you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say ""Pass the sugar. I want a divorce.""It's not that easy.Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.I can't bring it up now.This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?And I laughed so much, I like to died.Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.Well, I never was very good at history.Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.- Now, Fran...
- And just think.Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.But ask yourself: Why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.Oh, I have a present for you.I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.I didn't realize it was so late. It's quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...Don't ever talk like that, Fran.- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.Stop it, Fran.You'll miss your train, Jeff.Are you coming?No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.Sure. Monday... and Thursday......and Monday again, and Thursday again.It won't always be like this, Fran.I love you.Careful. Lipstick.Merry Christmas.- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.I work for the outfit.Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.O-U-T. Out!Where'll we go? My place or yours?Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...Would you like to see his picture?Not particularly.He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.Like a little Chihuahua.- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.You got a girlfriend?She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.C.C. Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.This way, Mrs. MacDougall.Say! This is snugsville!Mrs. MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you......you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go... and I may go just like that...I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.Let's not waste any more time
preliminarywise.I'm with you, lover.All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.Come on. It's past checking-out time.The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.O-U-T, out!Come on, wake up.Oh my God.Miss Kubelik?I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.I didn't mean right now!Dr. Dreyfuss.Doc!There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?You're gonna wear yourself out.- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.- Good night?!
- The party's over.What? Did I do somethin' wrong?It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.Not this one. In there, Doc.- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!My shoes!Some lover you are! Some sexpot!Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!You fink!Is she gonna be all right, Doc?- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.Bring my bag.Roll up her right sleeve.Hold that.Nice veins.Wanna tell me what happened?I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.You see, we had... some words earlier.It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.Yes, you are.If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.Get the coffee.Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.What's her name?Miss Kubelik. Fran.Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.Do you understand what I'm saying?Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.- Doctor?
- Dr. Dreyfuss.Dreyfuss.Get more coffee.Now tell me again. What's my name?Dr... Dreyfuss.And what happened to you?I...I took sleeping pills.Do you know where you are?- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!I don't know.Do you know who that is?Look at him.Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.Hello, Miss Kubelik.Mr? Miss? Such politeness!We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.What are you doing here?Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?Oh, yes. The office party.- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.I don't understand.The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?I'm so tired.Come on. Drink this.Please... just let me sleep.No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!Let's get her walking.We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!One, two, three, four!Left, right, left, right......left, right and return!And... one, two, three, four!Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!One, two... And return again.And... left, right, left, right.She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.Just as long as she's OK.These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.How do you spell her last name?Kubelik. Two k's.What's her address?Where does she live?Why do you wanna know, Doc?- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.There was no suicide note or anything.- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbor?Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.But as your neighbor,
I'd like to kick you around the block.- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.I don't know what you did to that girl......but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.Live now, pay later. Diners Club!Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.A mensch! A human being!So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.Well, you know where I am
if you need me.Mr. Baxter! Open up already.Oh.- Mrs. Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?What was going on here last night?- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!- Army maneuvers maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.Come on, Oscar.Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr. J.D. Sheldrake.Make that person-to-person.Five, four, three, two, one...Let her rip!I'll get the phone.Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.Come on. Help me round up some flies.- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.Yes, Baxter.Just how serious is it?It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?Well, it was just a suggestion.No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble......policewise or newspaperwise.You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.Actually, he thinks she's my girl.No, he just jumped to the conclusion.Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover......and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?Well, I'll... think of something.Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.I'm sorry.- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.Here. Let me help you.Oh, I'm so ashamed.Why didn't you just let me die?What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.Oh!Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.Oh, my dress. I have to go home.You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.Here. Put that on.- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.I'll fix you some coffee.Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.Back in a minute.Mrs. Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriagewise.Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.Who are you calling?My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.I'll say I spent the night with a friend.- Who?
- Someone from the office.- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.- What's her first name?
- Miss.- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.Thanks for reminding me!I didn't mean it that way.I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.He doesn't give a damn about me.- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.But that's not the worst part.The worst part is I still love him.Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.So where's the victim?Max the Knife!- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?- I can't eat.
- You must eat.And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.With the no napkins.A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?Who needs it? Now you listen to me.You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man... a widower, maybe......and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.- What did I tell you?
- Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.If he makes trouble, give me a yell.- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.Did you find something here?
An envelope?Yes. I've got it.Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?Open it.There's nothing here but a $100 bill.That's right. Will you see
that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?Sure.Take this away, will you?Would you like me to move
the television set in here?- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo......then came home and cleaned up
after Mr. Eichelberger.He had a little eggnog party here.So I'm way ahead this year.Three across. Spades double?High deals.Six? Eight.I think I'm gonna give it all up.Give what up?Why do people have to
love people, anyway?I know what you mean.Queen.- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.A cemetery?I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.Uh, gin.That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.I have this talent for falling in love......with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.Well, how many guys were there?Three.The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.They found a shortage in his accounts.He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.Cut.So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.But I flunked the typing test.- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.I just can't spell.So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.And that's how I met Jeff.Oh God, I'm so fouled up.What am I gonna do now?Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.Was he very upset when you told him?Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.I'm sure that's it.- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.Would you hand me that pad and pencil?- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.- You what?
- As one woman to another.- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.I don't like myself very much anyway.Pick up the cards. Let's go.- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.Gin.10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.Spades are double... 154.Blitzed. Two games. All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?What do I want? Just a minute.- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?I made a reservation for four o'clock.You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?Mildred!- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.No!Well, I don't blame you.So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelikwise.Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.Stay with it, Buddy-boy.Who was that?Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?Would you mind opening that window?- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.So they'll shoot me, like a horse.Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.- Who'd care?
- I would.Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?Yeah. Well...That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.Go to sleep.- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.You let me go four years ago, Jeff.And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.- Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?Yes. She's in the shower.- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.Oh.- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.How can I help her? My hands are tied.Well... at least you can talk to her.Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.There's a call for you!- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.I don't wanna talk to him.I think you should.I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.I'll be right back. OK?Hello, Jeff.- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?Fran?Are you there, Fran?Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.I never took those pills,
I never loved you......we never even met.- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.It concerns your husband.All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.Don't worry. I'm on my way.Just making a personal call.Here's a dime.Going down.Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.Gas?!Miss Kubelik?Miss Kubelik!- You all right?
- Sure!- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3 1/2 pair.Things are a little disorganized
around here.I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.I used it to strain the spaghetti.- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick......a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.- I guess so.
- I know so.- He's a taker.
- What?Some people take, some people get took.And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.I wouldn't say that.What would you like for dinner, huh?Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...I really should be getting home.- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.I went through exactly
the same thing myself.- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.I tried to do it with a gun.- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.I went to a pawnshop and I bought a.45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?- Here.
- In the knee?!Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.But I got over the girl in three weeks.Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.- Yes, Nurse.
- [Baxter hums opera music]- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21 st floor.Thanks.So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.- Who?
- Kubelik.No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.AWOL, hm?What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne......while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah.I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.She lives with us, and my wife's nervouscause Fran hasn't been home
for two days.That so?So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.I see.What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?Who is Buddy-boy?- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious livingwise. Meatball Meatball- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.Shipwrecked, among eight million people.And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand......and there you were.It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?- The dishes.
- I mean after that.- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.So keep a clear head.Cause I don't wanna take advantage of
you, the way I did yesterday in bed.- Baxter?
- Yes.What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.Want a martini?How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.Not you. Miss Kubelik.- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.You?Who else?Leave him alone!Oh, you fool. You damn fool.- [Karl] Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.Goodbye, Doctor.Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.Let me get my bag.Don't bother, Doc.It doesn't hurt a bit.Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C. Baxter.Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.Will you call me back, please?Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.All your troubles are over.I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.The plain fact is, I love her.I thought you should be the first to know.After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.So I think it would be best all around.Solutionwise.Yes?I'll be right up.Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.All your troubles are over.19.- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.27.Those two days
she spent in the apartment......made me realize
how lonely I'd been before.But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.If I can ever square things with her family.Good morning. C.C. Baxter.- Mr. Baxter is here.
- Send him in.Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.And I've got good news for you, Baxter.- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.I'm going to take her off your hands.- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.I've moved out of the house.I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?Yeah.Now what's your news, Baxter?It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.This way, Baxter.Sit down. Try it on for size.- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...Say, what happened to you, Baxter?- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?Good evening, Mr. Baxter.Oh.Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
- I guess so.You were wrong about me too.What you said about those who take
and those who get took.Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.A paneled office, three windows.So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorcewise.That's very wise.- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.- There you are.
- Much obliged.Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...If you don't mind?- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik......I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.So now I'll have to borrow your key.- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.- How's that again?
- No key.Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.Do you realize what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.- You dig?
- I dig.So what's it going to be?- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.But this is the key
to the executive washroom.That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?Well, I got things to do.- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.Where are you moving to?I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.Sorry to lose you, Baxter.Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.Say, why don't you join us?We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.No, thanks. I don't feel like it.In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbor.By the way, whatever happened to her?You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.Ring out the old year, ring in the new.Ring-a-ding-ding.I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.Baxter?He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.Threw that big, fat job right in my face.- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.What's he got against you, anyway?I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookiewise.What are you talking about?I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.Should auld acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind...Happy New Year, Fran. And days of auld lang syne For auld lang syne, my dear For auld lang syne We'll drink a cup of kindness yet For auld lang syneFran?Where are you, Fran?Mr. Baxter!Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!Oh!- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.Are you sure? How's your knee?I'm fine all over.- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.Let me get another glass.- Where are you going?
- Who knows?Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.I'm on my own.That's funny. So am I.What'd you do with the cards?In there.What about Mr. Sheldrake?I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.Cut.I love you, Miss Kubelik.Three.Queen.Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.Shut up and deal."

liberty, insert them into your mouth.Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?It's the classic approach.

Has it worked since?Now, if you would be
so kind as to read.""A wealth of words.""Fight against those marbles,

- Mmm.Promise me...Promise me no more.Ah!Hello?- Is anyone there?

I like to keep things simple.""Poor and content

but I'm afraid you're late.- Yes. I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?Ah... He doesn't know I'm here.Well, that's not a very promising start.No. No, look,
my husband has seen everyone.To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure of yourself.Well, I'm sure of anyone
who wants to be cured.Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...- Well, he's required to speak publicly.

I'll make a frank appraisal- and then we'll take it from there.

War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy- to know he was aboard.
- Am I considered the enemy?You will be, if you remain un-obliging.You'll appreciate the need
for absolute discretion.Of course.How did you find me,

She's a sport.She warned me your Antipodean methodswere both ""unorthodox""
and ""controversial.""I warned her those
are not my favorite words.I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work,I need trust and total equality, here
in the safety of my consultation room.No exceptions.Oh, well. In that case...When can you start?- She's still sounding a bit rough.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad.- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.I had a special visitor this afternoon.- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?You must stay, bored stupid, listening
to your parents' inane conversation.- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.- And Mum.
- Me, too.- You meeting Jean?
- No. Someone else.- Doctor? Doctor?
- Hmm?Go and help your brother
with the washing up.- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?Why bring it up
if you can't talk about it?Myrtle, it's just a woman
looking to help her husband.Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?Could be a lot of fun.I'm sure you'll be splendid.In the amateur scene,
they're a highly regarded group.From Putney.No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, ""The Flight.""Mama,
I long to know where they fly to.- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.Weren't they lucky?Now Papa, tell a story.Can't I be a penguin instead?Well, no, I want a penguin story.Very quickly.Once there were...
two princesses.Princess Elizabeth
and Princess Margaret,whose papa was a penguin.This was because he'd been
turned into one by a wicked witch.This was very inconvenient for him
because he loved......to hold his princesses in his arms.But you can't if you're a penguin
because you...- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.And what made matters worse is that
she... she sent him to the South Pole,which is an awfully long walk back if......if you can't fly.So when he reached the water, he......he dived in, through the depths,so fast that he was in
Southampton Waters by lunchtime.And from there,
he took the 2:30 to Weybridge,changed at Clapham Junction, asked a......a passing mallard the way
to Buckingham Palace,swam up The Thames,
out through the plugholeand gave the cook, Mama
and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.Now, when the girls
heard all the commotion,they ran to the kitchen,
where they gave him a......a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.And as they kissed him......guess what he turned into?- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.- Oh.
- With wings so big,that he could wrap them both around
his two girls together.Now, girls. Time for bed. Come on.- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.Feed them, brush them and to bed.- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?No. About her.- A married woman? He can't be.
- She can.By the way, I think I've found
someone rather interesting.On Harley Street. Doctor.Out of the question.I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat... Matter's settled.Mmm. His approach
seems rather different.Now?Now.Now is the winter of our discontent,made glorious summer
by this sun of York.And all the clouds
that lour'd upon our housein the deep bosom of the ocean buried.Now are our brows bound
with... victorious...Thank you.- Lovely diction, Mr...
- Logue. Lionel Logue.Well, Mr. Logue,I'm not hearing the cries
of a deformed creatureyearning to be king.Nor did I realize Richard III
was King of the Colonies.I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.- Sydney?
- Perth.Major theater town, is it?- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.I was well reviewed.Yes.Well, Lionel,
I think our dramatic societyis looking for someone slightly younger.And a... little more regal.- There you are.
- Thank you.- Oh.
- Mmm.No, you have to shut that one first.Close that one first. That's it.Where did you find this... physician?Classifieds. Next to a
""French model, Shepherd's Market.""No, he comes highly recommended.Charges substantial fees
to help the poor.Oh, dear. Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.Uh... The Johnsons.You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.Lionel says wait here
if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.Or, it being a......pleasant day......perhaps take a stroll.Was that all right, Lionel?Marvelous, Willie.You can stay here and wait for your mum.Mrs. Johnson.Mr. Johnson. Do come in.Would you like a sweetie?He's a good lad, Willie.He could hardly make a sound, you know,
when he first came to me.My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?Please, make yourself comfortable.I was told not to sit too close.I believe when speaking with a prince,one waits for the prince
to choose the topic.Waiting for me to......commence a conversation,
one can wait rather a long wait.Ah, yes, well...Do you know any jokes?- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?- No. No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.Aren't you going to start treating me,
Dr. Logue?Only if you're interested
in being treated.Please, call me Lionel.No, I... prefer Doctor.I prefer Lionel.- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.Then... it's ""sir"" after that.It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.Prince Albert Frederick Arthur......George.How about Bertie?- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.In here, it's better if we're equals.If... if we were equals,
I wouldn't be here.I'd be... at home with my wife,and no one would give a damn.Please, don't do that.I'm sorry?I believe sucking smoke into your lungs,
well, it will kill you.My physicians say it relaxes the...- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.My castle, my rules.Thank you.What was your earliest memory?- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.I'm not......here to discuss personal matters.- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.- I doubt that.
- Don't...- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.I can assure you, no infant
starts to speak with a stammer.When did yours start?- Four or five.
- That's typical.So I've been told.I... I can't remember not doing it.I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?Everyone natters to themselves
occasionally, Bertie.Stop... Stop calling me that.I'm not going to call you anything else.Then we shan't speak.Are you charging for this, Doctor?A fortune.I'll just let that brew.So... when you talk to yourself,
do you stammer?No... of course not.Well, that proves that your impediment
isn't a permanent part of you.What do you think was the cause?I don't... don't know.I... I don't... I don't care.I... I stammer.No one can fix it.I'll bet you that you can read
flawlessly, right here, right now.And if I win the bet,
I get to ask you more questions.- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.One usually... wagers money.A bob each to keep it sweet?- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.I had a funny feeling you mightn't.I'll stake you, and you can
pay me back next time.- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.So please stand, uh,
and take a look at that.From there.I... I can't read this.Well, then you owe me
a shilling for not trying.To be......or not to be, that...- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh! I haven't finished yet.I'm going to record your voice and then
play it back to you on the same machine.This is brilliant.
it's the latest thing from America.It's a Silvertone.Pop these on.There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.- You're playing music!
- I know.So how can I hear what I'm saying?Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing?You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?Hopeless.Hopeless!You were sublime.Would I lie to a prince of the realm
to win 12 pennies?I've no idea......what an Australian
might do for that sort of money.Let me play it back to you.No.All right, then, well,
I get to ask you the questions.Thank you, Doctor. I don't......feel this is for me.Thank you for your time.Goodbye.Sir.The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.No.Oh, well.Bugger.For the present, the work
to which we are all equally boundis to arrive at a reasoned tranquility
within our borders,to regain prosperity
at this time of depressionwithout self-seeking,
and to carry with usthose whom the burden of the past yearshas disheartened or overborne.To all, to each,
I wish a happy Christmas.God bless you.And off air.Easy when you know how.Sir?Have a go yourself.- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.Sit up. Straight back.Face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye,as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.Papa, I don't... think I can read this.This devilish device will change
everything if you don't.In the past, all a king had to do
was look respectable in uniformand not fall off his horse.Now, we must invade people's homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them.This family's been reduced to those
lowest, basest of all creatures.We've become actors.We're not a family, We're a firm.Yet at any moment,
some of us may be out of work.Your darling brother and future king,the only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another.- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.No divorced person
can ever be received at court.He said it made him
sublimely happy.I imagine that was
because she was sleeping with him.""I give you my word,""
this is what he said.""I give you my word,
we've never had immoral relations.""Stared square into
his father's face and lied.When I'm dead,
that boy will ruin himself,this family and this nation
within 12 months.Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.Marshal Stalin the other half.Who will stand between us,the jackboots
and the proletarian abyss?You?Well?With your older brother
shirking his duties,you're going to have to do
a lot more of this.Have a go yourself.Through the...- ...wireless...
- Get it out, boy....one of the......marvels of...""Modern."" Just take your time.
Form your words carefully....science......I am enabled...Relax.Just try it!...this Christmas Day......to speak to all my...Do it!Who 's Been Polishing the Sun ?Lying... bastard.- You're playing music.
- I know.So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth 's doing.You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?âTo be or not be,
that is the question.Whether tis nobler in the mind to sufferthe slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,or to take arms
against a sea of troubles,and by opposing end them ?To die, to sleep no more,and by a sleep to say the endis the heartache
and the thousand natural shocksthe flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless. ""Hopeless!Strictly business. No...- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear- in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.Besides, you... you tricked me.Physical exercises
and tricks are important,but what you're asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem.Is that sufficient? Uh, no.As far as I see it, my husband has
mechanical difficulties with his speech.- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?All right. You want mechanics?We need to relax your jaw muscles,
strengthen your tongue,by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, ""I'm a thistle-sifter.I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.- Because I am a thistle-sifter.""
- Fine.And you do have a flabby tummy,
so we'll need to spend some timestrengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.Forget about the blessed shilling!Perhaps, upon occasions......you might be requested to assist......in coping with......with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?Of course.Yes, and that would be the full extent
of your services.- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.Feel the looseness of the jaw.Good. Little bounces. Bounces.Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.Put your hands onto your ribs.Deeper. Good.- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.Isn't that what
public speakings all about?My wife and I are glad
to visit this important...Take a good deep breath,
and up comes Your Royal Highness.And slowly exhale,
and down comes Your Royal Highness.- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.It's actually quite good fun.Mmm... Mother.Shorten
the humming each time.Mother. Mmm...- ...manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.Now, just sway.Perfect.- ...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.Ding dong bell,
pussy's in the well.Who put her in? Little Tommy Tin.You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.- A cow, a cow...
- A king.A... a king...Anyone who can shout vowels at an open
window can learn to deliver a speech.- Fourteen, 15!
- Good. Deep breath, and...It is...- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.A sieve of thisted siphles.Gah! Mah! Bah!Father.- Father.
- Father.- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.- Father.
- Father.Father. Father.- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.You been waiting long?Christ, bloody freezing.Where have you been?- I've been busy.
- So have I.- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.- She'll recover.
- Father won't.I'll drive.Old bugger's doing this on purpose.- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.To... To complicate matters with Wallis.For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.Wallis explained. She's terribly clever
about these things.Whereas my letters patent
under the Great Sealbearing date of Westminster
the 11th day of June 1912,His Majesty King George the Fifth
did constitute orderand declare that there
should be a Guardian...- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...it's the Order
of the Council of State, sir.So that we may act on your behalf......much clearer to me, I'm afraid...- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.Thank you.- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.I feel dreadful. Ah...Been, uh, ice skating? Ice skating?No. No, George.Yes. Yes, all right, of course.I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talkis a poor substitute
for holding tight and making drowsy.Nor making our own drowsies either,
as we've had to do too often lately.- David. Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.It's Bertie.No. No, it's not important.I don't want to.No. Telephone me later?All right, goodbye.- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.She forgets Papa's bloody clocks
are all half an hour fast.How's the King?
I... I hope he's not in pain.No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.Thank you.David, if your father were here,
tardiness would not be tolerated.None of this unpleasantness
would be tolerated.You know, sir, I appreciate
that you are different from your father,both in outlook and... temperament.I want you to know that whenever
the King questioned your conduct,I tried, in your interest,to present it
in the most favorable light.Mmm. I can always trust you
to have my best interests at heart.I fear our vigil will not be
of long duration. Please continue.Let us commend our brother George
to the mercy of God,our Maker and Redeemer.Long live the King.I hope I will make good
as he has made good.- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.Now, I'm trapped.And in these last 25
crowded, troubled, glorious years,if there is one thing
that King George has taught,it is the art of the leader who
is also e brother to his followers.As long as he lived, he was
the guiding star of a great nation.- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?...the little children
cried in the streets.- You sure?
- Go on.Put your thinking caps on.- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello. it's always Othello.Art thou afeard?- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.The isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airsthat give delight, and hurt not.Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears,and sometimes voices, that,
if then I had waked after long sleep,will make me sleep again. All right,
clever clogs, so what comes next?And then, in dreaming,
methought the clouds would...- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open,and show riches ready to drop upon me,that when I waked,
I cried to dream again.That's such a sad thought.My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.Won't be a moment, Clifford.Bertie?They told me not to expect you.I'm sorry about your father.- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all. Please, come in. Come in.I've been practicing. An hour a day.In spite of everything.What's going on there?Oh, I was... Sorry.Mucking around with my kids.Do you feel like working today?- Curtis biplane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.Logue.Logue.I'd kill for something stronger.I wasn't there
for my father's death.- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.At least there was free beer.Here's to the memory of your father.I was informed, after the fact,that my father's...My father's last words were......""Bertie has more guts than the
rest of his brothers put together.""Couldn't say that to my face.My brother.What about him?Try singing it.- I'm sorry?
- What songs do you know?- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.- Swanee Riven
- I love that song.- It happens to be my favorite.
- Sing me the chorus.No. Certainly not.You know...
I always wanted to build models.But... Father wouldn't allow it.He... collected stamps,
so we had to collect stamps.You can finish that off if you sing.âª My brother David
Dum, dum, dum, dum... âª- I'm not going to sit here warbling.
- You can with me.- Because you're peculiar.
- I take that as a compliment.Well...Rules are rules.I'm not... crooning Swanee RivenCamptown Races, then.
J' My brother David said to meâª Doo-dah, doo-dah âª- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.Does it feel strange
now that David's on the throne?To tell the truth, it was a relief.Knowing I......wouldn't be... King.But unless he produces an heir,
you're next in line.And your daughter, Elizabeth,
would then succeed you.âª You're barking up
the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor âªâª Lionel âªSee? You didn't stammer.Of course I didn't stammer,
I was singing.Well, as a little reward, you get
to put some glue on these struts.- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.David and I were... very close.Young bucks, you know.Did you chase the same girls?David was always very helpful
in... arranging introductions.We shared the......expert ministrationsof Paulette in the Palace.Not at the same time, of course.- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.""B-B-B-Bertie.""Father encouraged it.Said, ""Get it out, boy!""
Said it would make me stop.He said, ""l was afraid of my fatherand my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!""Are you naturally right-handed?Left.I was... punished,
and now I use the right.Yes, that's very common with stammerers.- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.Metal splints were made.Worn... worn day and night.- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.Straight legs now.Who were you closest to in your family?Nannies.Not my first nanny. She...She loved David. Hated me.When we were......presented to my parents
for the daily viewing,she would... she'd pinch meso that I'd cry and be handed back
to her immediately.And then she would...Sing it.âª Then she wouldn't feed meFar, far away âªTook my parents...
three years to notice.As you... as you can imagine,
caused some stomach problems.Still.What about your brother, Johnnie?Were you close to him?Johnnie... sweet boy.Had......epilepsy.And he was... different.He died at... 13.Hidden from view.I'm... I'm told it's not... catching.Do you want a top-up?Please.You know......Lionel, you're......you're the first
ordinary Englishman...- Australian.
- ...I've ever really spoken to.When I'm... driven through the streetsand I see the, you know,
the common man staring at me, I......I'm struck by how little
I know of his lifeand how little he knows of mine.- Thank you.
- What are friends for?I wouldn't know.I sifted seven......thick-stalked thistles
through a strong, thick sieve.- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.Listen, I have to keep doing this,
it's awful. I sifted seven...- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...One-hundred-year-old spruces
removed to improve the view?Who does she think she is?Nonetheless, we must try
to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.- She calls me ""The Fat Scottish Cook.""
- You're not fat.I'm getting plump.Well, you seldom cook.- I sifted seven...
- Shut up....thick sieves...
I sifted seven...Three, two, one and...Their Royal Highnesses
the Duke and Duchess of York.Oh, how lovely to see you both.Welcome to our little country shack.I came at the invitation of the King.Your Majesty.- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.Very nice to see you... Mrs. Simpson.Very nice.Hello, David. Making some......changes to the garden, I see.Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.Don't tell me I behaved badly,
Mr. Churchill.On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.Etiquette decrees that royalty
should be greeted by the official host,in this case, the King. Not a commoner.Thank you.- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.Apparently, she has certain skillsacquired in an establishment
in Shanghai.David.Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.- Doing what?
- Kinging.Really? Kinging is a......a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.Ls kinging laying off 80... staff
and buying more pearls for Wallis,while people are marching across Europe
singing The Red Flag?- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?Where's the bloody 23?And you put that woman
in our mother's suite!- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.Here it is. Wallis likes the very best.I don't care what woman
you carry on with at night,as long as you... show up
for duty in the morning.Wallis is not just some woman
I'm carrying on with.We intend to marry.- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.Good God.Can't you just give her
a nice house and a title?- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.Your beloved common man
may marry for love. Why not me?If you were... a common man,on what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?Sounds like you've
studied our wretched Constitution.- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...Yearning for a larger audience,
are we, B-B-Bertie?Don't. ..What's that?I'm sorry, I...Younger brother trying to push
older brother off the throne.P-P-Positively mediaeval.Wallis.Ah. Where have you been all this time?- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.What a very complicated
little King you are.I try to be.All that work... down the drain.My own brother.I couldn't say a single word
to him in reply.Why do you stammer so much more
with David than you ever do with me?Because you're bloody well
paid to listen.- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.What is it about David
that stops you speaking?What is it about you that bloody
well makes you want to go on about him-the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!- ls that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody......bugger to you, you beastly bastard.Oh, a public school prig
could do better than that.Shit.Shit, Shit, Shit.Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit!Yes, defecation flows
trippingly from the tongue.- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the ""f"" word?- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.Fuck. Fuck!Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see? Not a hesitation.Willy, shit and fuck! And tits.- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.Just finish your homework.Well, that's a side of you
we don't get to see all that often.No.No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?Logue, you have no idea.My... my brotheris infatuated with a......woman who's been married twice.She's asking for a divorce,
and he's determined to marry her.- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson- of Baltimore.
- That's not right.- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.Where does this leave you?I know my place. I...I... I will do anything......in my power to keep
my brother on the throne.Is it that serious?- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.- You could do it.
- That is treason.I'm trying to get you to realize
you needn't be governed by fear.I've had enough of this.- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class bankerwho wants elocution lessons
so you can chitchat...Don't attempt to instruct me
on my duties!I am the son of a... King.And the brother of... of a King.You're the disappointing son
of a brewer.A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.Through here, sir.It's not because she's an
American. That is the least of it.It's because she's a soon
to be twice divorced American.And the King,
as head of the Church of England,cannot marry a divorced woman.And, sir, I apologize
for the nature of this.According to Scotland Yard,the King has not always
possessed exclusive rightsto Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections......sharing them with a
married used car salesman,a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.In addition, it is also
rumored Hitler's ambassador,Count von Ribbentrop,
sends her 17 carnations every day.Should His Majesty continue to ignore
the advice of his government,he must abdicate.Otherwise, his government
has no choice but to resign.Prime Minister,
you'd leave a country without a......a government?Does the King do what he wants?Or does he do what
the people expect him to do?As crowds in Downing
Street watch ministers come and go,can a king separate his personal life- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?I'm just having trouble with a patient.That isn't like you.- Why?
- He's scared.He's afraid of his own shadow.Isn't that why they come to you?This fellow could
really be somebody great.He's fighting me.Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.Perhaps that's what you want.I might have overstepped the mark.Apologize. Do you both good.I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue,
the Duke is busy.I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.Thank you.Thank you.Parliament will not support
the marriage.But there are other reasons for concern.He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve,and there are those who are
worried about where he will standwhen war comes with Germany.- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.War with Germany will come.And we will need a King
whom we can all stand behind, united.I fear my......brother is not of sound mind......at this time.Have you thought
what you will call yourself? Hmm?Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.What about George?
After your father?George the Sixth
has a rather nice continuity to it.Don't you think?David. Thank God.You look exhausted.How are you bearing up?Bertie, the decision's been made. I...I'm going.- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.I must marry her.My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.That's a terrible thing to hear.Nobody wants that.I, least of all.At long last,I am able to say a few words of my own.I have never wanted
to withhold anything,but until now it has not been
constitutionally possiblefor me to speak.A few hours ago,
I discharged my last dutyas King and Emperor,and now that I have been succeeded
by my brothel;the Duke of York,my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him.This I do with all my heart.You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne,but you must believe me when I tell youthat I have found it impossible
to carry the heavy burdenof responsibility
and to discharge my duties as King,as I would wish to dowithout the help and support
of the woman I love.And I want you to know,this decision has been
made less difficult to meby the sure knowledge that my brother,with his long training
in the public affairs of this country,and with his fine qualities,will be able to take my place forthwithwithout interruption or injuryto the life and progress of the Empire.I meet you today......in......in circumstances which are...- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.Thank you, darling.
Saddles. Margaret.- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you. Oops.- Don't worry, Sally. We'll get you...
- Mama?- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses- in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.We'll have a palace of rooms.Curtsey.Your Majesty.How was it?I was trying to...
familiarize myselfwith... what a state paper looks like.It's a......dispatch from Mr. Baldwin,
which I don't understand a word of.David's finances.Christmas... broadcast.- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.Oh.Plans for the Coronation.Think that would be
an even bigger mistake.- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.I'm a Naval officer. That's all I know.I'm not a King. I'm not a King.- I'm sorry.
- No.- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly. Please.Oh, my dear.My dear, dear man.- I'm sorry.
- You know,I refused your first
two marriage proposals,not because I didn't love you,but because I couldn't bear
the idea of a Royal life.Couldn't bear the idea of a life
of tours, public duty, of...Well, a life that no longer
was really to be my own.But then I thought, he stammers
so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.Waiting for a King to apologize,
one can wait rather a long wait.I'm afraid we're slightly late.This is home.Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.It's lovely. Absolutely lovely.- Oh! May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?Here's your shilling.I understand......what you were trying to say, Logue.I went about it the wrong way.I'm sorry.So, here I am.Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?Every stammerer always fears
going back to square one.I don't let that happen.If I fail in my duty,David could come back.
I've seen the placards.""God save our... King.""They don't mean me.Every monarch in historyhas succeeded someone who's deador just about to be.My predecessor is not only alive,
but very much so.It's a bloody mess.Couldn't even give them
a Christmas speech.- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.He's not here anymore.Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.Easy enough to give away.You don't have to carry him
around in your pocket.Or your brother.You don't need to be afraid
of the things you were afraid ofwhen you were five.You're very much your own man, Bertie.Am I?- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!Myrtle.- Is this your wife?
- Yes.Bertie. Come here.- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.- What is it?
- Oh!- You're...
- It's ""Your Majesty"" the first time.After that, it's ""Ma'am."" As in ""ham.""Not ""malm"" as in ""palm.""I haven't told her about us.Sit down, relax.I'm told your husband
calls my husband Bertie.And my husband calls
your husband Lionel.I trust you won't call me Liz.Your Majesty, you may
call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.Get out there, man.Hello, Myrtle, darling.You're early.I believe you two have met,
but I don't think you know...- ...King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.Will Their Majesties
be staying to dinner?We'd love to, such a treat,
but alas a......previous engagement. What a pity.- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.What a glorious transformation, sir.I hope you'll forgive us
if we continue our preparations?Now, allow me to guide you
through the ceremony.We begin, of course,
at the West door into the nave.I see all your pronouncements
are to be broadcast, Archbishop.Ah, yes. Wireless.It is, indeed, a Pandora's box,and I'm afraid I've also had
to permit the newsreel cameras.The product of which
I shall personally edit.Without momentary hesitations.This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.He's... my speech therapist.- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majestywas seeking assistance, I should
have made my own recommendation.Dr. Logue will......will be attending the Coronation.Of course I'll speak to the Dean,
but it will be extremely difficult.I should like the......doctor to be seated in the......King's Box.But members of your family
will be seated there, sir.That is why it is suitable.And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace,
we need the premises.My dear fellow,
this is Westminster Abbey.The Church must prepare His Majesty.My preparations are equally
as important.With complete privacy,
if you don't mind.Those are my wishes, Your Grace.I will place the Abbey
at Your Majesty's disposal,this evening. Your Majesty.I can't believe I'm walking
on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.Call me Lionel.True, you... never......called yourself Doctor. I did that......for you.No training.No diploma, no......qualificationsJust... a great deal of nerve.The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?You asked for trust.And... total equality.Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.My son Laurie said, ""Dad, do you think
you could help that poor man?""- What, as a failed actor?
- it's true.I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.When the Great War came,all our soldiers were returning
to Australia from the front,a lot of them shell-shocked,
unable to speak.Somebody said, Lionel,
""You're very good at this speech stuff.Do you think you could possibly
help these poor buggers?""I did muscle therapy,
exercises, relaxation,but I knew I had to go deeper.Those poor young blokes
had cried out in fear.No one was listening to them.My job was to give them faith
in their own voice,and let them know that
a friend was listening.That must ring
a few bells with you, Bertie.You give a very noble
account of yourself.- Make inquiries. It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.You have no idea who I have
breathing down my neck.I vouched for you, and you have no...- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.Everything I know,
I know from experience.And that war was some experience.My plaque says,
""L. Logue, Speech Defects.""Not ""Doctor.""
There are no letters after my name.- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.- On what charge?
- Fraud.With war looming, you've saddled
this nation with a voiceless......King. You've destroyed
the happiness of my family,all for the sake of ensnaring
a star... patient you couldn't......possibly hope to assist.It'll be like mad......King George the Third.I'll be... Mad King......George the Stammerer......who let his people down
so badly in their hour of need.What are you doing? Get up!
You can't sit there! Get up!- Why not? it's a chair.
- No, it... That is not a chair!That is... That...- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.That chair is the seat
on which every King...- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes- have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me! Listen to me!- Listen to you? By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.- I am your King!
- No, you're not.You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.Why should I waste my time
listening to you?Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!Yes, you do.You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.You'll make a bloody good King.- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.Mr. Logue, you must know thatI've found a replacement English
specialist with impeccable credentials.Hence, your services
will no longer be required.- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's functionis to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,- but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.In this personal matter,
I will make my own decision.My concern is for the head
on which I must place the crown.I appreciate that, Archbishop.But it's my head.Your humble servant.Thank you, Bertie.Shall we rehearse? Come on.
Up on your perch.Now, when you and Elizabeth
enter through the West door,you will be greeted by the hymn
""I was glad when they said unto me.""Actually, you won't be that glad because
they do sing it for a very long time.Then your friend, the Archbishop,
will ponce up the stairs towards you,and say, ""Sir, is Your Majesty
willing to take the oath?""- ""l am willing.""
- Well, of course you are.I'm gonna see what this sounds like
in the cheap seats,so even your old nanny can hear.""Will you govern your peoples,
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,Australia and New Zealand,according to their lands and customs?""- ""l solemnly promise to do so.""
- Louder.- I can't hear you up the back.
- ""I solemnly promise to do so.""Very good. ""And will you, to your power,cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be
executed in all your judgments?""""I will. I will!""Then there's a very long bit
about upholding the faith. It goes on,rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,
to which you finally say...""The things which I have...
here before promised,I will perform and keep.
So help me God.""And that's all you say.
Four short responses.Kiss the book, sign the oath,
and you're King.Easy.You nearly crowned him backwards,
Archbishop.Someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the crown, sir.Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.Archbishop, we're missing Papa.- God save the King.
- Very good.Very good, Archbishop.Well, I hope Your Majesties
are thrilled with the result.- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait. Keep going.- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.Masses of uniformed men,
stupefying to the eye,and incredible to the imagination
have stood in spellbound audienceof the Fuhrer.- Papa? Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?I don't know, but he seems
to be saying it rather well.Sir... I have asked to see you todayin order to tender my resignation
as Prime Minister.I'm so sorry to hear that,
Mr. Baldwin.Neville Chamberlain will
take my place as Prime Minister.It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.I have found it impossible to believethat there is any man in the worldso lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,that the world may be hurled
for a second timeinto the abyss of destructive war.Churchill was right all along.This was always Hitler's intention.I'm only very sorry to leave you
at this great time of crisis.I'm very much afraid, sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.I am speaking to you......from the Cabinet room
at 10 Downing Street.This morning,
the British ambassador in Berlinhanded the German government
a final notestating that unless
we heard from them by 11:00,that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,a state of war would exist between us.I have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received,and that, consequently, this country
is at war with Germany.At last, sir, here is your speech.You are on air at six.I have timed it
to just under nine minutes.The wording is fully approved.The Prime Minister
will be joining you for the broadcast,which will go outlive
across the nation, the Empire- and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no. Go straight there.We'll be all right.- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.We have about 40 minutes
to the broadcast.Thank you very much. Thank you.There may be dark days ahead...- ...and...
- Try again.There may be dark days ahead, and...Turn the hesitations into pauses and say
to yourself, ""God save the King.""I say that continuously,
but apparently no one's listening.Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.Then I'm the solemnest king
who ever lived.You know, if I'm a king,
where's my power?Can I... can I form a government?Can I... can I... levy a tax?Declare a... a war? No.And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why? Because......the nation believes
that when I... I speak,I speak for them. But I can't speak.Let's take it all again from the top.
""In this grave hour.""In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.Perhaps the most fateful
in our history... Bugger, shit, shit.âª I send to every household of my...You see, ""P"" is always difficult,
even when I'm singing.Bounce on to it. ""A peoples.""A people. A people.Household of my peoples,
both at home- and overseas.
- Beautiful.This message... âª Doo-dahâª Spoken with the same depth of feeling
Doo-dah day âªFor each one of you,
as if I were able to...Shit, fuck, bugger! ...cross your
threshold and speak to you...In your head now. ""I have a right
to be bloody well heard.""Bloody well heard,
bloody well heard myself!Now, waltz. Move.
Get continuous movement.âª For the second time
in the lives of most of us- âª We are at... âª
- ""We are,"" take a pause.- Lionel, I can't do this.
- Bertie, you can do it.- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie. it's time.- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.A great moment, sir.- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.Nice to see you... again so soon.Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have a...- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions-from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.Congrat... Congratulations.- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.The long... walk.Good luck, sir.I, too, dread this apparatus.Had a speech impediment myself,
you know.- I didn't.
- Family secret. Tongue-tied.An operation was considered
to be too dangerous.I eventually made an asset of it.- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.Darling.- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.Mr. Wood.- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.I'm a thistle-sifter.I've a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.A sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.- Because I'm...
- Bertie. Darling.Make sure it's not switched on.Remember, the red light
will blink four times,then I've asked them to turn it off.'Cause we don't want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through.One minute, sir.I'm sure you'll be splendid.Forty seconds, sir.Logue.However this turns out......I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.Knighthood?Twenty seconds.Forget everything else,
and just say it to me.Say it to me as a friend.In this grave.....hour.....perhaps the most fateful
in our history......I send......to every household of my......a-peoples......both at home......and overseas......this message......spoken with the same
depth of feeling......for each one of you......as if I were able
to cross your thresholdand speak to you... myself.For the second time
in the lives of most of us......we are... at...Fuck, fuck, fuck!...at war.Very good.Over and over again......we have tried to find......a peaceful way out
of the differences......between ourselves......and those......who are now our... enemies.But it has been... in vain.We have been forced into a conflict,for we are called
to meet the challenge of a principle,which, if it were to prevail,would be fatal to any civilized orderin the world.Such a principle,stripped of all disguise,is surely the mere......primitive doctrine that might......is right.For the sake of all
that we ourselves hold deanit is unthinkablethat we should refuse to meet......the challenge.It is to this high purposethat I now callmy people at home,and my peoples across the seas,who will make our cause their own.I ask them to stand calmand firm and unitedin this time of trial.The task will be hard.There may be dark days ahead,and war can no longer be confinedto the battlefield.But we can only do the rightas we see the right,and reverently commitour cause to God.If one and all we keepresolutely faithful to it,then, with God's help,we shall... prevail.It was very good, Bertie.You still stammered on theWell, I had to throw in a few,
so they knew it was me.Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.Thank you, Mr. Wood.- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.Ready.- Good?
- Perfect, sir.Your first wartime speech.Congratulations.I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.Thank you, Logue.Well done.My friend.Thank you......Your Majesty.I knew you'd be good.Thank you... Lionel.Onwards.- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.Couldn't have
said it better myself, sir.Your Majesty, I am speechless.- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,- but you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.Of course I was.Are we all ready?Come on, girls. *Best downloaded from subscene.com*

digging graves, they may run.No time for jokes. Finish work!Dig, dig.How about putting us
on sick list?Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.You no sick. You never sick.Why you always play sick
to me, Shears?Don't want one of these
over my head, I guess.Captain Kanematsu......how about a butt?I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.That's what l mean.
I want to return the favor.When a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart......like you gave me that butt,
I remember it from the heart.That's why......l want you to keep this lighter.Think l stole it?It belonged to that English kid
we just buried.He willed it to me
for a favor I'd done him.Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.You funny man, Shears.Okay, you go on sick list. Him too.One of these days Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him......then where'll we be?Before that happens
we'll be far away from here, chum.Far away.Okay, let's knock off.Here lies....Weaver, l forgot who we just buried.Thomson.Yes.Here lies
Corporal Herbert Thomson......serial number 01234567.Valiant member of the King's Own
or the Queen's Own or something......who died of beriberi
in the year of our Lord, 1943......for the greater glory of....-What did he die for?
-Come off it.No need to mock the grave.I don't mock the grave or the man.May he rest in peace.He found little enough of it
while he was alive.""A"" Company, mark time!Mark time!Halt.Into line, left turn.Stand easy.We're gonna be a busy pair
of gravediggers, Weaver.Well done, well done.That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.-You gonna tell him the truth?
-Of course not.You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.My name is Nicholson.I am Colonel Saito.In the name of
His Imperial Majesty......l welcome you.I am the commanding officer
of this camp......which is Camp 1 6......along the great railroad......which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.You British prisoners
have been chosen......to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill.And officers will work
as well as men.The Japanese army cannot
have idle mouths to feed.If you work hard,
you will be treated well.But if you do not work hard......you will be punished.A word to you about escape.There is no barbed wire.No stockade.No watchtower.They are not necessary.We are an island in the jungle.Escape is impossible.You would die.Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.Let me remind you of
General Yamashita's motto:""Be happy in your work.""Be happy in your work.Dismissed.Battalion, stand at ease.Fall out, Major Hughes.Battalion, stand easy.Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.I'm gonna have a word
with this fellow. Colonel!I heard your remarks just now, sir.My men will carry on in the way
one expects of a British soldier.My officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.You may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labor......is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.Is that so?I have a copy of the Convention......and would be glad to
let you glance through it.That will not be necessary.Sit down, please.Yes, sir.-I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
-Very good, sir.Clipton, don't let me interrupt.-How's the arm?
-Nearly healed.Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.-Good.
-How do you do, sir?We found him and an Australian.All that's left of the prisoners
who built the camp.U.S. Navy? Out here?For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.-You lost your ship?
-The Houston.I made it ashore, but l got separated
from the other survivors.And your group here?Mostly Aussies. Some lime--Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.And what happened to them?They died......of malaria, dysentery,
beriberi, gangrene.Other causes of death:Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,
snakebites......Saito.Then there were some
who just got tired of living.Has Clipton seen you?Just about to, sir. Come over here,
commander, you can shave later.All right.You'll stay with the officers.We'll scrape up
some decent clothing.Don't bother about me.I'm not anxious to
get off the sick list.Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.The officers in your party
did manual labor?I think you could call it that.I raised that very point
with Colonel what's-his-name.Saito.-l think he understands now.
-ls that so?Yes. l must say he seems
quite a reasonable type.Well, l must be pushing on.There's an officer's meeting at 7.-Give me a list of your requirements.
-Yes, sir.Anything we can do.Oh, thank you, sir.-What is it?
-Never mind.Go on, say it.I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito......but reasonable, that's a new one.Perhaps Colonel Nicholson
defines the word differently.Any other points?-By your leave, sir?
-Yes, Jennings?About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears--There won't be any
escape committee.I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings
has a plan, but escape?Where? Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 1 00 of survival.I'm sure a man of Commander Shears'
experience will back me up on that.I'd say the odds against a
successful escape are 1 00 to one.-Right.
-But may l add another word?Please.The odds against survival in this camp
are even worse.You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.To give up hope of escape......to stop thinking about it,
is like accepting a death sentence.Why haven't you tried to escape,
commander?I'm biding my time. Waiting for
the right moment, the right company.I understand how you feel.Of course, it's the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape.But my men and I are involved
in a curious legal point......of which you are unaware.In Singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters.Ordered, mind you.Therefore, in our case, escape might
well be an infraction of military law.-Interesting?
-Yes, sir, interesting point.I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't quite follow you.You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?Without law, commander,
there is no civilization.That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.Is there anything else?I think we're all clear
on the program.I want everything to go off without
a hitch starting tomorrow morning.And remember this:Our men must always feel
they are still commanded by us......and not by the Japanese.So long as they have that idea,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.Are you with me there, commander?Well, l....I hope they can
remain soldiers, colonel.As for me, I'm just a slave.A living slave.Queer bird. Even for an Ameri--He's been in isolation too long,
poor chap.Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.English prisoners!Notice l do not say English soldiers.From the moment you surrendered,
you ceased to be soldiers.You will finish the bridge
by the 12th day of May.You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer.Time is short. All men will work.Your officers will work beside you.This is only just......for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender.Your shame is their dishonor.It is they who told you......better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero.It is they who brought you here,
not I.Therefore, they will join you
in useful labor.That is all.Officer prisoners, collect your tools.Bradley, back in your place.I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito......to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.""Belligerents may employ
prisoners of war......who are fit,
other than officers--""Give me the book.By all means.
You read English, l take it?-Do you read Japanese?
-I'm sorry, no.If it's a matter of translation,
I'm sure it can be arranged.You see, the Code states that--Stand fast in the ranks.You speak to me of code?What code?The coward's code!What do you know
of the soldier's code?Of Bushido? Nothing!You are unworthy of command!Since you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilized world......we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you.My officers will not
do manual labor.We shall see.All enlisted prisoners to work.Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.Battalion, take up tools.Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!""A"" Company, by the right,
quick march.Eyes right.Eyes front.Eyes right.Quick march, eyes right.""C"" Company, by the right.What's he up to?Looks like he doesn't
want any witnesses.Now, you will be reasonable.You will order your officers to work.No.I will count three.If by the third count......you and your officers
are not on the way to work......l will give the order to fire.He's going to do it.Believe me,
he's really going to do it.One.I warn you, Colonel Saito.Two.Stop!Colonel Saito,
I've seen and heard everything.So has every man in the hospital.There are too many witnesses.You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?You see, Jennings, there are certain
advantages to being on the sick list.I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.""Into the valley of death
rode the 600.""How's that, sir?That kind of guts.Also the kind they had in 1914......when officers fought
with only a swagger stick.-l see what you mean.
-You don't see what l mean at all.The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.Excuse me, sir,
I'd like to go along too.Arm's almost healed, sir,
really it is.What about him?He didn't order us not to escape,
he suggested.Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.Here we go again.Colonel Saito says all officers
to punishment hut.Tell them to go.Not you.Come.Leave him alone!They're gonna put him in the oven.For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellowFor he's a jolly good fellowAnd so say all of usAnd so say all of us
And so say all of usFor he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellowFor he's a jolly good fellowAnd so say all of usTimber!One, two, three, four.No, no, no!Let go!You wish to see me?I've been trying to see you
for three days.It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--I could have you shot.Those prisoners who tried to escape,
they were in your charge.I knew nothing about the escape.It does not matter.One must even respect
those who tried.For a brief moment,
between escape and death......they were soldiers again.But it is insane to try and escape.Two soldiers shot,
the third drowned.To what end?It was an escape from reality.There is your reality.This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today.And this shows the position
of actual progress.Because of your
colonel's stubbornness......we are far behind schedule.That is not all.Enlisted prisoners
sabotaged the work.Yes, l have seen it.
I could have them all shot.Then who would build your bridge?Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?Perhaps the men don't work well
without their own officers.My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.Do not speak to me of rules.This is war!This is not a game of cricket.He's mad, your colonel......quite mad.Sit down, please.I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.Thank you.Tell him that if his officers
will not work......I'll be forced
to close the hospital......and your patients will
work in their place.And many will die,
and he will be responsible.Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.Hey, the doc's going
to see the old man.Sir....It's Clipton, sir.I brought you a few things.-How are the men?
-Fine, sir, fine.We scraped together a little meat
and a coconut.And the officers?Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.And Lieutenant Jennings....
Jennings is dead.-What?
-Killed, attempting to escape.Also two others,
Corporal Weaver and the American.Jennings. Poor, brave lad.I warned him, didn't l, Clipton?Look, sir, we haven't much time.I'm going to clean you up a little
while l talk.I've got something to tell you.I've just had a word with Saito.That man is the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.Blackmail.I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.It's still blackmail.Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.Wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.But Saito's cut their food rations......and if he makes
the sick men work....Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.Yes, Clipton, l understand. Truly.But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.If we give in now,
there'll be no end to it. No.Sir, we're lost in the jungle,
a thousand miles from anywhere.We're under the heel of a man
who'll stop at nothing to get his way.Principle!No one will ever know or care
what happens to us.Give in, sir. Please!I'm adamant.I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.-Time.
-All right.Please thank those concerned.Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.Reynolds stole the coconut.We'll be able to get you
something from time to time.We've bribed one of your guards.Goodbye, sir. And good luck.Many thanks.-Clipton!
-Yes, sir?Did you say that American chap
was killed?Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.It's insane to plan escapes.Three men killed, and to what end?-Time!
-Here.-Here is where we must win through.
-Time, time!The doc just looked at us and shook
his head. Whatever that means.Means only one thing,
colonel won't give in.Well?It's like this.Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.It's a question of principle.As medical officer, I protest
to the way he's being treated.It's a wonder he's still alive.Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.He is responsible.Not I.You sick?Are they both mad?Or am l going mad?Or is it the sun?Attention!Battalion, attention.English prisoners.Let us ask the question......why does the bridge not progress?You know why,
because your officers are lazy!They think themselves too good
to share your burden.This is not just.Therefore, you are not happy
in your work.Therefore, the bridge
does not progress.But there is another cause.I do not hide the truth.With deep shame and regret......l admit to you the failure......of a member of the Japanese staff.I refer to Lieutenant Miura.He is a bad engineer.He is unworthy of command.Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.Tomorrow we begin again.I shall be in personal command.Today we rest.All work and no play
make Jack a dull boy.As token of regard
for your efforts in the future......l give presents to you all.Let us be happy in our work.Company, dismissed.Battalion, dismissed.Hey, take a look at this.Red Cross! He's given us our--Hey, he's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.""Tomorrow we begin again.""Hey, Harry, look.They're letting the old man out.Most likely gonna give him
another pasting.Good evening, colonel.Do you mind sitting over here?I am having rather a late supper.English corned beef.No, thank you.Produce of Scotland.I prefer it to sake.I spent three years in London,
you know.I studied at the London Polytechnic.Cheers.Sorry.Later, perhaps?Perhaps.I was not a good artist.My father disapproved.He felt l belonged in the army.So l changed from art
to engineering.I must tell you, Colonel Saito.I intend to make a full report
of your activities in this camp.I do not think you quite
realize my position.-l must carry out my orders.
-Oh, quite, quite.My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 12th day of May.-l have only 1 2 weeks more.
-No doubt.Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.But no officers, except in
an administrative capacity.But officers are working
along the entire railway.You know it. l know it.I'm not responsible
for the actions of other officers.Personally, I'm appalled.Let's not get excited.Will you have a cigar?No. Thank you.When I said all officers must work......naturally, l never meant you,
the commanding officer.My orders were only intended
for officers below--None of my officers
will do manual labor.Please! I was about to say:I've been thinking the matter over
and have decided......to put majors and above
on administrative duties......leaving only junior officers
to lend a hand.I'm afraid not. The Convention's
quite clear on that point.Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?I haven't the foggiest.I'd have to kill myself.What would you do if you were me?I suppose if l were you......I'd have to kill myself.Cheers.I warn you, colonel......if I am to die,
others will die before me.Do you understand that?-Major Clipton did mention that.
-Well?That won't solve your problem.But I'm sure we can arrive
at a proper solution.Please sit down.Now, tell me, colonel......do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?-Of course.
-Good.Now....Take this bridge of yours.It's quite an enormous undertaking.Frankly, I have grave doubts whether
your lieutenant-- What's his name?-Miura.
-Miura.--is capable of tackling
a job of such importance.On the other hand, l have officers,
Reeves and Hughes for instance......who have built bridges
all over India.The men respect them.It's essential for an officer to have
that respect, I'm sure you agree.If he loses it,
he ceases to command.And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.A pretty poor commander I would be
if l allowed that to happen.Perhaps you are not aware......that the bridge is now
under my personal command.Really? And may l ask,
are you satisfied with the work?-l am not!
-You've proved my point.I hate the British!You are defeated
but you have no shame.You are stubborn
but have no pride.You endure
but you have no courage.I hate the British!Pointless, going on like this.Stay there!Stand down. Stand down!Battalion, attention!Battalion, stand at ease.Please....Do you know what is
the date today, colonel?I'm afraid I've lost count.It's the anniversary of
our great victory...-...over Russia in 1905.
-Oh, yes.Throughout East Asia
we are celebrating this date.In honor of this occasion......l have given your troops
a day of rest.Many thanks.I am declaring a general amnesty.You and your officers may
return to your quarters.As part of this amnesty......it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labor.He's done it!Somebody deserves a medal, sir.How many men in your party?Well, l don't really know, sir.-You don't know?
-Sir, 1 2, usually.But, well, one of the men took sick
very suddenly this morning, sir.It took three or four
to help him to the hospital.And-- He took terrible sick, sir.A corporal should always know
how many men he has under him.Oh, yes, sir.Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.It may be funny to you,
but it's not military behavior.No, sir.We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.Yes, sir.-l say, Reeves?
-Yes, sir?You ever constructed a bridge
across a stream like the Kwai?Yes, sir, half a dozen of them,
in Madras, Bengal....If this were your bridge......how would you get it under way?Get it under way, sir?Well, first of all,
I wouldn't build it here.Oh, why not?As l was trying to tell you......the Japanese couldn't have picked
a worse location. There's no bottom.You see those piles?They're sinking.Our chaps could drive those logs
till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.Where would you build it?Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.No teamwork.Some of those parties are actually
working against each other.Yes.I tell you, gentlemen, we have
a problem on our hands.Thanks to the Japanese,
we now command a rabble.There's no order, no discipline.-Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
-Yes, sir.Which isn't going to be easy.But fortunately, we have
the means at hand. The bridge.-The bridge, sir?
-The bridge.We'll teach them a lesson in Western
efficiency that will put them to shame.We'll show them what
the British soldier is capable of.Yes. l see your point, sir.I realize how difficult
it's going to be here......where you can't find
what you need.-But there's the challenge.
-l beg your pardon, sir.You mean, you really want them
to build the bridge?You're not usually
so slow on the uptake, Evans.I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.Fact is, if there weren't any work,
we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?-That we would, sir.
-So we're lucky.But it's going to be a proper bridge.Here again l know the men.It's essential that they
take pride in their job.-Right, gentlemen?
-Yes, sir.Reeves, you're the key man
in this situation, as engineer.Tell me what you want and we'll
organize it. Can we make a go of it?-We'll do our best, sir.
-Fine.We must draw up our plans......then arrange a conference
with Saito......and set him straight.Well, l think that takes care of all
the procedural matters. Now....Oh, yes.The next point is somewhat unpleasant
for all concerned, I'm afraid.Sorry to tell you, we feel the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily......and, l have to add, incorrectly.Incorrectly?Unfortunately, yes.Our engineer has made
a study of the site......and has concluded that
the river bottom there is too soft.Too soft?Mud. All the work up to now
has been useless.-Reeves, will you carry on?
-Yes, sir.Colonel, I've made tests.Those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before they'd hold.That bridge would collapse
under the first train.The pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch.Just a moment, Reeves,
before you get too involved.Colonel, do you suppose
we could have a cup of tea?Then l take it we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster......we build a new bridge,
at the site picked by Reeves......400 yards downstream.So let's proceed to the next point.I've decided to alter
the daily work quota of our men.-Alter?
-Yes, I've increased it.From a yard and a half
of earth moved to two.I was sure it would meet
with your approval.Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?I've done a time study, Colonel Saito,
of the entire project.As you can see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.I would strongly urge we revise the
organization of the working parties.Just a moment. Colonel, it would save
time if we could work during dinner.Would it be possible
to have a meal served here?Of course.If we---Carry on, Hughes.
-Yes, sir.If we increase the number of squads
and specialize their functions......I'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30 percent.Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point....Now, there's another important
decision that can't be postponed.As most of the British
will work on the bridge......only a small number will be available
for railway work.I must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang......so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible.I have already given the order.We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.I thought of setting it at a yard
and a half so as not to overtire them......but isn't it best
to be the same as ours?That would also create a healthy
competitive spirit.I have already given the order.-We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
-Yes, sir.I think that completes
the agenda for this evening.Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.And are there any other questions?One question.Can you finish the bridge in time?Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible.But we'll certainly give it a go.We mustn't forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement......for which l was not to blame.Is there anything else?No.Thank you. The meeting is closed.-Good night.
-Good night.I hope these Japanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.For the moment, I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.-Good night, Clipton.
-Good night, sir.By the way, l meant to tell you......there are trees in this forest
very similar to elm.And the elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.-Six hundred years, Reeves?
-Yes, sir.Six hundred years.That would be quite something.Good morning. I'm looking for an
American named Commander Shears.-Oh, yes, down on the beach.
-Oh, thank you very much.Kiss!Too many eyes.You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas......when all l need is love.It's true.
All you really need is love.What makes you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?Because I'm a civilian
at heart, lover.And l always follow my heart.Kiss.How's that, commander?Don't call me commander.It's unromantic.You're an officer yourself.How would you like it
if l called you Lieutenant Lover?Let's be democratic.
Just call me ""sir.""Yes, sir.Brass ahoy.He wants to see you. He's all yours.-I'm going for a swim.
-Don't leave me.-Commander Shears?
-Yes.My name's Warden.-How do you do?
-Sorry to intrude--That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.Like a martini?That's very kind, but l think not.-Mind if l have one?
-No.How did you get that?Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.Oh, yes, of course. Jolly good.Well, I'll be as brief as possible.I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 31 6.Our headquarters is up
in the Botanical Gardens.-Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
-Not quite.-Sure you won't have a martini?
-No, thanks.We have a particular interest
in that railway you worked on.You could give us no end
of valuable information.Well, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days......and I've already told your people
everything I know.But you could help us
in a rather special sense.I know it's a terrible imposition......but l wonder if you could possibly
come out and see us.Well, if you want to go over
the whole thing again.Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.-Lord who?
-Mountbatten.-We're one of his special pigeons.
-Oh, I see.Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car for you.This evening? Out of the question.Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 1 0?-Okay, 1 0:00.
-Thanks very much.-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.Good luck.Thanks.I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're
going to stand me up tonight.You couldn't be more wrong.General salute!Present arms!-May I see your pass, sir, please?
-Oh, yes.Thank you, sir.Carry on, driver.Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the path.All right, thanks.Good show, Jenkins. Good show!Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man. Use your knife.Good! On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.Come on, move yourselves!
Move! Move quickly!Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.Always use your knife
immediately, Joyce.You see, he's gained the initiative.Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.-You're sorry?
-So am l, sir.-l thought you were the enemy.
-I'm American, if that's what you mean.-That'll be all, Joyce.
-Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.-What can l do for you, sir?
-l was on my way to see Major Warden.I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.-That's the end of his lecture.
-Thunderous ovation.He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.-Major Warden, sir?
-Yes?Very good of you to come.-l hope they took care of you.
-They certainly have.Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.Colonel Green is looking forward
to meeting you.-Fascinating place, isn't it?
-Utterly charming.Didn't realize it was
a commando school.We're trying to discourage the use of
that word. Such a melodramatic air.What do you do here?Sabotage, demolition,
that line of country.We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.That pop was made
with a lump half this size.It's twice as powerful as gelignite
and only half the weight. Here.It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.Thanks for telling me.It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic.See? You can do
what you like with it.This is my place.Go ahead.Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.-Would you care for one?
-No, thanks.-A drink?
-No, thank you.-Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
-Very good, sir.Do you read this?Oh, l taught Oriental languages
at Cambridge before the war.I never congratulated you
on your escape. lt was a good show.I was lucky. If your sea-rescue plane
hadn't spotted me, l wouldn't be here.No, I suppose not.Would you like to see
where you were?All right.Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.But we think the camp is about here.Say, do your people have any idea
what happened to Colonel Nicholson?He had guts. They were about to
shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.If you're about to be shot
there's not much you can do.Here is the River Kwai, and here is
the village where you were helped.And here is the railway.But then you must be fairly familiar
with all this area.Not really, l was out of my head
half the time.The railway starts down here
in Singapore. Malaya......Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea
is to drive on through, into India.-Where was I picked up?
-Oh, about here.The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-
Rangoon section by the middle of May.Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.It's too far for bombers
to carry an adequate load.We'll have to go smash it
on the ground.-How will you get there?
-Parachute drop, then march.With demolition equipment
through that jungle?Our chief problem
is lack of firsthand knowledge.You see, none of us have
ever been there.-l don't want to discourage--
-lt should be interesting.Colonel Green's given me
the Kwai bridge.I'm gonna take a team in
and blow it up.Lucky you.Sure you won't have tea?No, thanks. l don't want to be rude,
but I've got a luncheon date at 2.-So if there are any questions....
-Of course, I'm sorry.Well, there is only
one question, actually.How would you feel
about going back?Come again?I know, under the circumstances,
it's a bit much......but you have a unique
knowledge for our purpose.And we'd love to have you with us.That's why you brought me here?To ask me this?Well, frankly, yes.Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!This is embarrassing--I can't go back! l don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.Actually, Colonel Green has taken
the matter up with your people.-With my people?
-Your Navy's turned you over to us.A signal arrived yesterday morning
from your ClNC Pacific......authorizing your temporary transfer
of duty to Force 31 6.-They can't do this to me.
-I'm afraid they have.It was difficult to know how
to break it to you.But they can't do this to me.
I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake.Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.The whole thing's a fake. I'm just
an ordinary swab jockey, second class.When the Houston sunk, l made
it ashore with a real commander.Later on, we ran into
a Japanese patrol. He was killed.I figured it was just a matter of time
before l was captured--So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.I thought officers would get
better treatment.That's very sensible.But at Saito's camp, the officers
worked along with the rest.Yes, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?I kind of got used
to being a commander......so when l arrived here
at the hospital......l took a look at the enlisted men's
ward and then the officer's ward......and l said to myself,
""Let's let it ride along for a while.""There were certain advantages.I saw one of them on the beach.Anyway, that's the whole story.The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer......an American commander
named Shears who doesn't exist.When the Navy learns the truth,
they'll say:""Ship him home in irons
for impersonating an officer.""-Once that happens, I've got it made.
-Got it what?-Made. I'd like that drink now.
-Of course.I'll apply for a medical discharge.I'll tell them
I impersonated an officer......because I went off my rocker
in the jungle.I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.It's quite a clever plan.It's not only clever, it's foolproof.If my Navy finds out who l am......those temporary orders won't be
worth the paper they're written on.This is your photograph, isn't it?-Where did you get this?
-lt took a bit of doing......because your people
couldn't identify you.Finally your ClNC Pacific
sent us a copy of your service record.The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?No.You see, we've known about
your actual rank for nearly a week.Your Navy's in an awkward position.In one sense you're a blasted hero......for making an escape
from the jungle.But at the same time,
they can't bring you home......and give you the Navy Cross
for impersonating an officer.I suppose that's why they were
so happy to hand you over to us.You see?Hot potato.As far as your present rank
is concerned......we're fairly informal
about those things in Force 31 6.You'd have the simulated
rank of major.Simulated major. That figures.Well....As long as I'm hooked,
I might as well volunteer.Good show!Oh, Colonel Green, sir.This is Major Shears. He volunteered
to go and help me blow up the bridge.Really?Good show!Jolly good show, major!Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.The colonel might think
I'm malingering.I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.Will someone tell me why the old man
wants us to build a proper bridge?Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.Yes. How's he behaving?He's been most reasonable
since we took over.-l wonder what he's thinking.
-l haven't the foggiest.-Thanks, Reeves.
-Right, sir.What do you think?Quite a challenge, isn't it?Sir, are you convinced that
building this bridge is a good idea?-Are you serious?
-Yes, sir.A good idea? Take another look.You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?Their condition has been improved?-Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
-Yes, sir, but--They feed better
and they are no longer abused.-That's all true.
-Well, then.Honestly, Clipton, there are times
when l don't understand you at all.I'll try to make myself clear, sir.The fact is, what we're doing
could be construed as......forgive me, sir,
collaboration with the enemy.Perhaps even as
treasonable activity.We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?Must we build them a better bridge
than they could have themselves?If you had to operate on Saito,
would you do your best or let him die?Would you prefer
we disintegrate in idleness?Would you have it said that
our chaps can't do a proper job?It's important to show these people
they can't break us in body or in spirit.Take a good look, Clipton.One day the war will be over.I hope that the people who use
this bridge in years to come......will remember how it was built,
and who built it.Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.-Yes, sir.
-You're a fine doctor......but you've a lot to learn
about the army.Hold him! Hold him!Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?Good morning.What on earth
are you people staring at?Get on with your jobs!Now get him with your boot!I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?-Sir?
-l was referring to the nurse.Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.Sit down.I asked you here to help us pick
the fourth member of your team.-Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
-Yes, sir.Chapman here wants Joyce,
but I have my doubts about him.I think he has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation.As I've told you before......in this job, even when it's finished
there's always one more thing to do.He's the best swimmer
in the school, sir.I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.All right, at ease.These gentlemen are thinking of
taking you for a hike into the jungle.Yes, sir.You were an accountant in Montreal?Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.That is, l didn't have my charter.Exactly what did you do?Well, sir, I just checked columns
and columns of figures......which people had checked
before me......and then other people checked them
after I had checked them.-Sounds a frightful bore.
-Sir, it was a frightful bore.How did you happen
to wind up here?In '39 l came over to London
to enlist.About two years later
I volunteered for this work.-You volunteered!
-Yes, sir. See, the regular army--Go ahead, you can be frank.Well, the regular army reminded me
of my job in civilian life.They don't expect you to think.Think about this.Are you quite sure you'd be able
to use it in cold blood?I know how to use it, sir.That's not what l meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?Could you kill without hesitation?That's a question I've often asked
myself, sir. It's worried me quite a bit.And what was the answer?I don't honestly know, sir.I've tried to imagine myself....I suppose I find it hard to kid myself
that killing isn't a crime.It's an old army problem.Well, l think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.Am l to go with the team, sir?We'll let you know.You see what I mean.Well, at least he was honest.None of us ever know the answer to
that question until the moment arises.What's your opinion, Shears?Well, sir, he's Canadian.And that's in keeping with the
international composition of this outfit.If he wants to go,
he can even take my place.Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce,
he's yours.I had a report from air reconnaissance
on that village.There's sufficient clearing
to make your jump at last light.-You've had parachute training?
-No, sir.Blast. This is awkward.Silly, it never occurred to me.Well, maybe--He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.I'll pop over
and check right away.-All right, Chapman, you can run along.
-Yes, sir.Well, feel like a sniff of air?Yes, sir.You don't realize what a plum
you are for us.Your knowledge of the area,
making friends in that village.It's almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind.By the way, here's something
that'll interest you. The new L pill.-L pill?
-L for lethal. Instantaneous, painless.Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.You're telling me
not to be taken alive.I wouldn't recommend it.If any of you get hurt or wounded the
others will have to leave him behind.The objective comes first
in our work.You want my honest evaluation
of this team?I didn't want to speak out
in front of them.I understand, go ahead.Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.Joyce is.... He'll be okay.-lt's Warden I don't get.
-Oh, why not?Cambridge don and all of that.It's one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers--He's not without experience,
you know.When we lost Singapore, he stayed
behind to blow up a couple of bridges.And many other installations
before the Japs caught him.-Caught him?
-Yes.-Fascinating story. He--
-Sir, it's most annoying.In view of time, they don't think
practice jumps would be worthwhile.-No?
-If you make one jump......you've only got 50 percent
chance of injury.Two jumps, 80 percent. Three jumps,
you're bound to get your packet.The consensus is, the most sensible
thing for Major Shears to do......is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best.With or without parachute?Oh, very good!With or without!He's in the trees!Yai says we can't reach
the Kwai by the route you took.There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.-Who's gonna lead the way?
-Yai himself.He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.Which means we shall have to
use women bearers.-Women bearers.
-They're very capable, I'm told.He says it's dangerous
to spend the night in the village.There's an enemy post three miles away
so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.-What about Chapman?
-Yai will bury him and his chute.Is there something wrong?I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language. I don't.He's gonna lead you back to the river
by a route I never took.Will someone tell me why
I'm so indispensable to this outfit?I know how you feel, but there's
always the unexpected, isn't there?Tell that to Chapman.Let's get cracking.You're lovely.Lovely.Be happy in your work.Yes, sir.Leeches.She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.What's wrong with that thing?It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.I'll tell you what's wrong.It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.You might as well dump it!This is Radio Tokyo signing off.This is your friendliest enemy
reminding you to take it easy......and never volunteer for anything.If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.-I've got it all decoded, sir.
-Read it.Yes, sir. ""One, original
bridge works reported abandoned.New construction downstream
from first site.Two, enemy intends to open railway
with passage of special train......Bangkok for Rangoon
with troops and V.l.P.Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.Three, synchronize demolition
with passage this train.Four, good hunting. Have fun.""
That's all, sir.A train and a bridge!Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?Yai says we're two to three days'
march from the Kwai.If we set a faster pace, we could
make it before sundown on the 12th.It's worth it for the train.Oh, by all means. Good hunting.
Good show.Jolly good fun. Jolly, jolly good.If you hadn't fixed the radio,
we wouldn't know about the train.Well, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?Heave!Heave! Heave!-Half a pint, sir.
-Quinine.Well, we'll complete this later.-Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
-Yes, sir?I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.We just haven't the manpower.I've asked the officers to lend a hand,
but even that won't do it.The officers are going to work?I explained the situation and they
volunteered, but it's not enough.Why not ask Saito
for some of his men?This is our show. We must
make the most of our resources.That's what l came to talk
to you about. The sick list.There's not a man in this hospital
who doesn't belong there.Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you......but there are always
a few malingerers.Be honest. Keep an open mind
is all I ask.Come along, let's see.Don't move, don't move.What's the matter with Haskins?He's got amoebic dysentery and
blackwater fever. Temperature of 1 04.Right. I see.And this man?Leg ulcers. l may be able to save
the leg if I do more cutting tonight.Really want to send him
out to work, sir?Don't talk rot, Clipton.-And that man there?
-His arm's infected.Most of their wounds
won't heal properly.I wonder, in his case,
if fresh air and light duties......might do more good
than being cooped up.-Light duties?
-lt's not our policy to keep a man...-...just because he scratched his arm.
-Not our policy?Well, is it?A man may not be on top of his form,
but he can still make himself useful.Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.Tell me, you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge?-Anything you say, sir.
-Good show.What about you? Nothing difficult.-I'll try, sir.
-Good man.Now, look here, men. lt goes
without saying I'm proud of all of you.But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it......how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?What do you say?-Yes, sir.
-Good show. Come on, follow me.Ten minutes.Make sure they're all dead.Come on, Joyce.Use your knife, man,
or we'll be shooting each other.Go that way, Joyce.I could have done it. l was ready.Are you hit, sir?Let's go.It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone,
but there's nothing broken.-lt's my fault, sir.
-Oh, shut up, Joyce.I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.Yeah, but how far and how fast?We won't know that
till I've tried it, will we?What are you doing?I didn't give orders for a halt.We all need it.We're still five hours' fast march
from the objective.Maybe six.Come on.You keep walking on that foot,
you'll bleed to death.Yeah.-You're gonna leave me here.
-If you stop, we stop.You can't study the layout
of the bridge after dark.You've got to get there
before sundown.But, sir, when the job's done, who
knows if we can return by this route......or whether we could find you
if we did?If you were me, l wouldn't hesitate
to leave you and you know that.He doesn't know it, but I do.You'd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it.You'll go on without me.
That's an order.You're in command now, Shears.I won't obey that order.You make me sick with your heroics.You carry the stench of death
like the plague.Explosives and L pills
go well together.It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.This is just a game, this war.You and that Colonel Nicholson,
you're crazy with courage. For what?How to die like a gentleman,
how to die by the rules......when the only important thing
is how to live like a human being!I'm not gonna leave you
here to die, Warden......because I don't care about
your bridge or about your rules.If we go on, we go on together.Good old Yai.I'm all right.Come on.Let's get closer.Still sorry we brought you along?-Feeling better?
-Yeah.You're in command again now,
you know.Thank you, major.I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.Not like the bridges
the enemy usually throws together.Look.Those poor devils down there.Imagine being forced to build that
in the condition they must be in.They've got a British officer
working on his knees.The Japanese seem
to be enjoying it too.If he knew we were here,
it might boost his morale a little.If not for the train, we could
set a time fuse and be miles away.Since we don't know
what time it'll cross tomorrow......we'll have to do the job manually.We'll set the charges
against the piles......about three feet under the water,
I should think......and run the main wire
downstream to the plunger.The problem is where to hide it.Our side of the river is quite
obviously used by the Japanese.They'd spot it at once.Look. Do you see
those fallen tree trunks?And the grey rock just below them
on that little beach?-Yes, sir, l see them.
-That's our key position.It's on the wrong side of the river......but it's the only hiding place
within feasible distance.As soon as the bridge goes up......whoever's there
will have to swim back.It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.Sir, l was the best swimmer
in my course.Yeah.It looks like
your line of country, then.Thank you, sir.Shears, pick a spot on our side
of the bank where you can cover Joyce.Yai will be with you
so you can occupy the Nips...-...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
-Right.On the theory that
there's always one more thing......I'll set up the mortar here
to create an additional diversion.Perhaps I might even take
a few potshots at the train.All clear?Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.They're sure to have
sentries on the bridge......so you'll have to float
the stuff down from upriver......which means building a raft.Yai.Yai will take three women
to help you build the raft.One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.Shears.You know, if it wasn't for my ankle,
I'd take Joyce's assignment.I know.You think he'll be all right?I think so. Want me to handle it?I'd let you stay up here
with the mortar if l could.I'm sorry.When it's over, I hope you get
that medical discharge......and not the hard way.Thanks.Load.Beautiful.Yes, beautiful.A first-rate job.I had no idea it would
turn out so well.Yes.A beautiful creation.I've been thinking.Tomorrow it will be 28 years to
the day that I've been in the service.Twenty-eight years in peace and war.I haven't been at home more
than 1 0 months in all that time.Still, it's been a good life.I love India.I wouldn't have had it any other way.But there are times......when suddenly you realize you are
nearer the end than the beginning.And you wonder....You ask yourself......what the sum total
of your life represents......what difference your being there
at any time made to anything......or if it made any difference
at all, really.Particularly in comparison
with other men's careers.I don't know whether that
kind of thinking's healthy......but l must admit I've had
some thoughts on those lines......from time to time.But tonight....Tonight....Blast.I must be off.The men are preparing
some sort of entertainment.Lovely.I'm sure l speak for all of us......when I say this has been
a most enjoyable evening.As you know,
most of you move on tomorrow......to a new camp
and new construction.It's a pity you won't be here to see
the first practical use of this bridge.However, you'll be glad to know
that the completion......of this link in the railway......will enable us to transport
the sick and disabled......to the new camp by train.Colonel Saito has kindly
permitted me to stay behind......with Major Clipton
and the sick men......and we'll rejoin you
in a few days' time.Now that your work here
is finished......l suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down.That's quite understandable.It's a very natural reaction.But one day, in a week,
a month, a year......on that day when, God willing,
we all return to our homes again......you're going to feel very proud
of what you have achieved here......in the face of great adversity.What you have done should be......and l think will be......an example to all our countrymen,
soldier and civilian alike.You have survived with honor.That, and more.Here in the wilderness......you have turned defeat
into victory.I congratulate you.Well done.To the king.And you're in business.Now, you got everything? Sten,
ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.Yes.I'll be directly across the river.The professor says there's
always one more thing to do.I can't think of what it could be.Except to wish you
a long and happy life.Thank you.What's happened?The river's gone down.You can see the wire.The charges!Don't wait for the train.Do it now!If Saito is correct, the train
should be along in five or 1 0 minutes.If you don't mind,
I'll watch from up on the hill.Why? You'll get a better view
from the bridge.It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.As you please. Honestly, sometimes
I don't understand you at all.Well, as you once said, sir,
I've got a lot to learn about the army.Good morning.River's gone down in the night.What's he doing?Colonel, there's something
rather odd going on.I think we better have a look around
before that train comes across.He's gone mad.He's leading him right to it.Our own man!I was right.
There is something going on.You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.Colonel, have you a knife? I've just
realized the bridge has been mined.Mined?Good boy!Officer, sir. British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir. British commando orders.-Blow up the bridge?
-Yes, sir. There's no time!No, no! Help!Help!Kill him! Kill him!Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!Kill him! Kill him!Help!Kill him, Joyce! Kill him!You!What have l done?Madness.I had to do it.I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.It was the only thing to do!Madness."

The Silence of the Lambs|1991|96|Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine|Jonathan Demme|"Starling!Starling!Crawford wants to see you
in his office.Thank you, sir.- Clarice.
- Hey.... so there shouldn't be
any problem if you could ...- You looking for Crawford?
- Yes, sir.He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office?- Okay.
- And I think they were over in Flushing ...Starling,Clarice M. Good morning.Good morning, Mr. Crawford.Sorry to pull you off of the
course at such short notice.Your instructors tell me
you're doing well.- Top quarter of your class.
- I hope so.They haven't posted any grades yet.A job's come up,
and I thought about you.Not a job, really.
More of an interesting errand.Sit down.Yes, sir.I remember you
from my seminar at UVA.You grilled me pretty hard,
as I recall,on the Bureau's civil rights
record in the Hoover years.I gave you an ""A.""A-minus, sir.Let's see. Double major, psych
and criminology. Graduated magna.Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.It says here when you graduate,you want to come to work for me
in Behavioral Science.Yes, very much, sir. Very much.We're interviewing all the serial
killers now in custody ...for a psycho-behavioral profile.It could be a real help
in unsolved cases.Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.Do you spook easily, Starling?Not yet, sir.See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.I want you to go after him again
today in the asylum.And who's the subject?The psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.Hannibal the Cannibal.I don't expect him to talk to you,but I have to be able
to say we tried.So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.How's he look? How's his cell look?Is he sketching, drawing?If he is, what's he sketching?Here's a dossier on Lecter.A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.Have your memo on my desk
by 08:00 Wednesday.Okay.Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?I wish there were.- I want your full attention, Starling.
- Yes, sir.Be very careful
with Hannibal Lecter.Dr. Chilton at the asylum ...will go over all the physical
procedures used with him.Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.And what is that?Oh, he's a monster.A pure psychopath.So rare to capture one alive.From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.Well.You know, we get a lot of
detectives here, but I must say,I can't ever remember
one as attractive.Will you be in Baltimore overnight?Because this can be quite a fun
town if you have the right guide.Well, I'm sure
this is a great town, Dr. Chilton,but my instructions are to talk to
Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.I see.Let's make this quick, then.We've tried to study him,
of course,but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.Oh, my, does he hate us!He thinks I'm his nemesis.Crawford's very clever,
isn't he? Using you.What do you mean, sir?A pretty young woman
to turn him on.I don't believe Lecter's even
seen a woman in eight years.And, oh, are you ever his taste.So to speak.I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.No staples or paper clips
on his paper.Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.If he attempts to pass you
anything, do not accept it.- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.I'm going to show you why we
insist on such precautions.On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.The doctors managed to reset
her jaw, more or less,save one of her eyes.His pulse never got above 85,even when he ate her tongue.I keep him in here.Dr. Chilton.If Lecter feels
that you're his enemy,then, well, maybe we'll have
more luck if I go in by myself.What do you think?You might have suggested this in
my office and saved me the time.Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.When she's finished, bring her out.Hi. I'm Barney.He told you,
don't get near the glass?Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.Nice to meet you, Clarice.You can hang your coat
up here if you like.Thank you. I will.He's past the others.
The last cell.You keep to the right.I put out a chair for you.Oh, yes. That's very good.
Thank you.I'll be watching. You'll do fine.Hi.I can smell your cunt.Good morning.Dr. Lecter, my name  is Clarice Starling.
May I speak with you?You're one of
Jack Crawford's, aren't you?I am, yes, sir.May I see your credentials?Certainly.Closer, please.Closer.That expires in one week.You're not real FBI, are you?I'm still in training at the Academy.Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?Yes. I'm a student.I'm here to learn from you.Maybe you can decide for yourself ...whether or not I'm qualified
enough to do that.That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.Sit, please.Now, then. Tell me,what did Miggs say to you?Multiple Miggs in the next cell.He hissed at you.What did he say?He said, ""I can smell your cunt.""I see.I myself cannot.You use Evyan skin cream.And sometimes
you wear L'Air du Temps,but not today.Did you do
all these drawings, Doctor?That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.You know Florence?All that detail
just from memory, sir?Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.Well,perhaps you'd care to lend us your
view on this questionnaire, sir.Oh, no, no, no.You were doing fine.You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.You had established trust with the
embarrassing truth about Miggs.And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.It won't do.I'm only asking you
to look at this, Doctor.Either you will or you won't.Yeah.Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed,if he is recruiting help
from the student body.Busy hunting that new one,
Buffalo Bill.What a naughty boy he is.Do you know
why he's called Buffalo Bill?Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.They said,
""This one likes to skin his humps.""Why do you think
he removes their skins,Agent Starling?Enthrall me with your acumen.It excites him.Most serial killers keep some sort
of trophies from their victims.I didn't.No.No, you ate yours.You send that through now.Oh, Agent Starling,you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?No.I thought that your knowledge ...You're so ambitious, aren't you?You know what you look like to me ...with your good bag
and your cheap shoes?You look like a rube.A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,but you're not more than one
generation from poor white trash,are you, Agent Starling?And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,pure West Virginia.What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?Does he stink of the lamp?And, oh, how quickly
the boys found you.All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,getting all the way to the FBI.You see a lot, Doctor.But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?What about it? Why don't you ...Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?Maybe you're afraid to.A census-taker
once tried to test me.I ate his liver
with some fava beans,and a nice Chianti.You fly back to school now,
little Starling.Fly, fly, fly.I bit my wrist so I could die.Look at the blood!Gotcha!Miggs! You stupid fuck!Hannibal the Cannibal!Agent Starling! Come back!Agent Starling! Agent Starling!I would not have had
that happen to you.Discourtesy is
unspeakably ugly to me.- Then do this test for me.
- No, but I will make you happy.I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.- And what is that, Doctor?
- Advancement, of course.Now listen carefully. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old
patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now.Doctor.I don't think Miggs could manage
again quite so soon,even though he is crazy.Go now!Hey, Bill.Hey.- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.How are you?Did you get any bad guys
today, Daddy?- No, angel, they all got away.
- Aw, shoot.FBI! Hands up! Don't move!Turn around!Hands behind your back!
Thumbs up.You're dead, Starling.Johnson, good job.
Good entry. Good commands.- Starling, where's your danger area?
- In the corner, sir.- Did you check the corner?
- No, sir.That's the reason you're dead.3109.3109.Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.Rule 404 ...- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford?- Yeah.
- Thanks, Ardelia.- Starling?
- Sir?Miggs is dead.Dead? How?The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon, and Miggs crying.They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.Starling?Yeah, I'm still here, sir.I just ... I don't know
how to feel about this.You don't have to feel any way about
it. Lecter did it to amuse himself.Look, I know it got ugly today,but you mentioned a name
at the end. Mofet.Any follow-up on her?Well, Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories ...prior to capture, so there's
no record of anyone named Mofet.But I thought
the ""yourself"" reference ...was too hokey for Lecter,so I figured, he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book,and there's a
""Your Self Storage"" facility,right outside of
downtown Baltimore, sir.Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,prepaid in full.The contract ...is in the name
of a Miss Hester Mofet.So nobody's been in here since 1980?Not to my knowledge.Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.Yes, I won't disturb anything.
I promise.I'll be out of here before you know it.- Can I help you?
- Yes, actually, you can.It's stuck.We could return tomorrow with my son.What about him?I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.Great.You just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.It's stuck.Hand me that flashlight, sir.Oh.If this door should fall down
or anything else,this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.Now, they know that you're with me.You call them if
anything should happen.Yes, Miss Starling.Clarice ...- They're waiting for you. Watch yourself.
- Thank you.Hester Mofet.
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?Hester Mofet, ""The rest of me.""""Miss The Rest Of Me,""
meaning that you rented that garage?Thank you.Your bleeding has stopped.How did you ...It's nothing.It's just a scratch.Dr. Lecter,
whose head is in that bottle?Why don't you ask me
about Buffalo Bill?Why, do you know
something about him?I might, if I saw the case file.You could get that for me.Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?You wanted me to find him.His real name is Benjamin Raspail.A former patient of mine,whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.I did not kill him, I assure you.Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,after he'd missed
three appointments.If you didn't kill him,
then who did, sir?Who can say?Best thing for him, really.His therapy was going nowhere.His dress, makeup ...Raspail was a transvestite?In life? Oh, no.Garden variety manic-depressive.Tedious. Very tedious.And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,a fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?Scared at first, then,exhilarated.Jack Crawford is helping your
career, isn't he?Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.I never thought about it.Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?True, he is much older,but do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges,fucking you?That doesn't interest me, Doctor.Frankly, it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.Not anymore.Thank you, Barney.What happened to your drawings?Punishment, you see, for Miggs.Just like that gospel program.When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.Dr. Chilton does enjoy
his petty torments.What did you mean
by transformation, Doctor?I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.I know they will never,
ever let me out while I'm alive.What I want is a view.I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.I want to be in a federal insti-
tution far away from Dr. Chilton.What did you mean
by fledgling killer?Are you saying
that he's killed again?I'm offering you a psychological
profile on Buffalo Bill,based on the case evidence.I'll help you catch him, Clarice.You know who he is, don't you?Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.All good things to those who wait.I've waited, Clarice,but how long can you
and old Jackie boy wait?Our little Billy must
already be searching ...for that next special lady.Hey, little cheeper.I'll be right there.Oh, shoot.Goddamn it.Perfect! Jesus.Can I help you with that?- Would you?
- Sure.- Thank you.
- That's all right.- You look kind of handicapped.
- Yeah.I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.Here. Just grab this.Okay.Good. Just set it down. That's good.Get in the truck.
I want to push it all the way up.- I really appreciate this. Thank you.
- All right.- Yeah.
- Thank you.Just go all the way back.Okay. Is this good?Yeah, that's good.- That's great.
- Okay.Say, are you about a size 14?Sorry?Good.Oh, good. Good.Hold!Starling!Outside. Let's go.Cindy, in the ring for Starling.
Let's go!FBI! Hold it! Hold it right there!Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're moving out.- You're going with Crawford.
- Where?Found a girl's body down
in West Virginia.Been in the water about a week. Looks
like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.There's no evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death.All the mutilation you see there
is post-mortem.Okay, three days.Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them.Each body in a different river.The water leaves us no trace
evidence of any kind.That's Fredrica Bimmel,
the first one.Her body was the only one he
took the trouble to weight down,so actually,
she was the third girl found.After her, he got lazy.Okay. Let's see.Circles where
the girls were abducted,arrows where their bodies were found.This new one today washed up here.Elk River, West Virginia.Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.Well, he's a white male.Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.He's not a drifter.He's got his own house somewhere,
not an apartment.- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.He's in his 30s or 40s.He's got real physical strength,combined with an older
man's self-control.He's cautious, precise.And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.Why not?He's got a real taste for it now.
He's getting better at his work.Not bad, Starling.- Questions?
- Yes, sir.You haven't mentioned anything about the
information contained in my report ...or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.I'm considering it.That's why you sent me
in there, isn't it?To get his help
on Buffalo Bill, sir?Well, if that was the case,
then I just ...I just wish I was in on it.
That's all.If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,Lecter would have
known it instantly.He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.Excuse me. Sheriff Perkins,
these are the FBI people.Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the State Attorney's office.We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now ...Sheriff, this type of sex crime
has certain aspects.I'd just as soon discuss in private.You know what I mean?- Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
- Yes, sir.Starling, we're back here.Tell Lamar to come on when he's
finished playing his music.Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.Is this working?I need a six-way linkup.Chicago, Detroit ...What? What?Excuse me! Excuse me, gentlemen.You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.There's things we need
to do for her.I know that you all
brought her this far ...and that her folks would
thank you if they could ...for your kindness
and your sensitivity.And now, please, go on now
and let us take care of her.Go on, now.Thank you.Thank you.Okay, good.Yeah, that's right.
West Virginia. Elk River.Stand by for transmission.Ray.Doctor, Lamar,
let's take a look at her.Oh, Jesus.Okay, Starling.Bill.Star-shaped contact entrance
wound over the sternum.Muzzle stamp at the top.- Wrongful death.
- ""Wrongful death.""She'll have to go to the
state pathologist at Claxton.Well, I better get back
to that service.Lamar will help you.Lord Almighty.What else do you see, Starling?Well, she's not local.Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's ...Glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me.Two of her fingernails
are broken off,and there's dirt or grit under them.It looks like she's tried to claw
her way through something.Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them through Missing Persons.Right.Let's do another.She's got something in her throat.When a body comes out of the water,lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.What is that, some kind of seedpod?No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.There's no way that could get
way down in there like that.Not unless somebody
shoved it in there.She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.- Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
- Yes, sir, I will.Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?Different configuration
than the other victims.Get close-ups.Victim's skin removed this time in
two large diamond-shaped sections ...above the buttocks.Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae ...approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.Starling?When I told that sheriff we
shouldn't talk in front of a woman,that really burned you, didn't it?It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.It matters, Mr. Crawford.Cops look at you to see how to act.- It matters.
- Point taken.Ligature marks found
around the wrists,not around the ankles.This would indicate that
the skinning was post-mortem.- Time, Pilch. My move.
- No fair. You lured him with produce.Tough noogies. Still my turn.Nice and slow, baby.If the beetle moves one of
your men, does that still count?Of course it counts.
How do you play?Agent Starling?Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.The body was in the Elk River,
West Virginia.It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.We heard about it on the radio.You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.A Sphingid. Ceratomia, maybe.Boy, he's a big sucker.Okay.Let's check morphology.What do you do when you're not
detecting, Agent Starling?I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?The amusing house wine?- Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
- Yes.- Got you.
- What do you got, Roden?Agent Starling,
meet Mr. Acherontia Styx.Weird.Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.- And where does it come from?
- That's what's strange.- They only live in Asia.
- Asia?In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.Somebody grew this guy,
fed him honey and nightshade,kept him warm.Somebody loved him.Where are you?Let me out of here!Please don't leave!Talk to me, please!Why won't you answer me? Please!Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.I'm Gene Cassel with sports.And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.Catherine Martin,the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,listed first as a missing person, is
now believed to have been kidnapped ...by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse ...has been identified,
sliced up the back ...in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.Young Catherine Martin,
as we've said,is the only daughter of
U.S. Senator Ruth Martin,the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.And while her kidnapping is not,
at this point,considered to be
politically motivated,nevertheless, it has stirred the
government to its highest levels.Reached for a comment on the
ski slopes of Stowe, Vermont,the president himself said to be,
and I quote, ""Intensely concerned.""Just moments ago, Senator Martin ...taped this dramatic personal plea.
- Excuse me.I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.Catherine is very gentle and kind.Talk to her, and you'll see.You have the power.
You are in charge.I know you can feel love
and compassion.You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world ...that you can be merciful
as well as strong,that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.You have that power.Please.My daughter is Catherine.- Boy, that's smart.
- Release her unharmed.Jesus, that's really smart.She keeps repeating the name.If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,it's harder to tear her up.
- Please. Release my little girl.What you're doing, Miss Starling,is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interviewand refusing to share information
with me for the third time.Sir, I told you,this is just a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's office.Please, either you discuss
this with him,or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?If your profile helps us
catch Buffalo Bill ...in time to save Catherine Martin,the senator promises you a transfer ...to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,with a view of the woods nearby.Maximum security
still applies, of course.You'd have reasonable
access to books.Best of all, though.One week of the year,you get to leave
the hospital and go here.Plum Island.Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,under SWAT team surveillance,
of course.And there you have it.A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.A copy of the senator's offer.This offer is
non-negotiable and final.If Catherine Martin dies,
you get nothing.""Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center.""Sounds charming.That's only part of the island.
There's a very, very nice beach.- Terns nest there. There's beautiful ...
- Terns?If I help you, Clarice,
it will be ""turns"" with us, too.Quid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.Not about this case, though.
About yourself.Quid pro quo. Yes or no?Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.Go, Doctor.What is your worst
memory of childhood?The death of my father.Tell me about it.
And don't lie, or I'll know.He was a town marshal,and one night
he surprised two burglars ...coming out of the back
of a drugstore.They shot him.Was he killed outright?No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.My mother died when I was very young,so my father had become
the whole world to me,and when he left me, I had nothing.
I was ten years old.You're very frank, Clarice.I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.Quid pro quo, Doctor.So tell me about Miss West Virginia.Was she a large girl?Yes.- Big through the hips? Roomy?
- They all were.What else?She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.Now, that hasn't
been made public yet.We don't know what it means.Was it a butterfly?Yes. A moth.Just like the one we found in
Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.Why does he place
them there, Doctor?The significance
of the moth is change.Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa,and from thence into beauty.Our Billy wants to change, too.There's no correlation in literature
between transsexualism and violence.- Transsexuals are very passive ...
- Clever girl.You're so close
to the way you're gonna catch him.- Do you realize that?
- No. Tell me why.After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.What happened next?I don't imagine the answer is on
those second-rate shoes, Clarice.I went to live with my mother's
cousin and her husband in Montana.They had a ranch.- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.- How long did you live there?
- Two months.- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.Why, Clarice?Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?Did he sodomize you?No. He was a very decent man.Quid pro quo, Doctor.Billy is not a real transsexual.But he thinks he is. He tries to be.He's tried to be
a lot of things, I expect.And you said that I was very close
to the way we would catch him.What did you mean, Doctor?There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.I wouldn't be surprised if Billy
had applied for sex reassignment ...at one or all of them
and been rejected.On what basis would they reject him?Look for severe childhood distur-
bances associated with violence.Our Billy wasn't born
a criminal, Clarice.He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.Billy hates his own identity,
you see,and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual.But his pathology is a
thousand times more savage ...and more terrifying.It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.Mister, my family will pay cash.Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.Okay, okay, okay.Okay. I'm there.Okay.Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.I promise.See, my mom is a real important woman.
I guess you already know that.Now it places
the lotion in the basket.Please! Please! I want to go home.I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to ...It places the lotion in the basket.I want to see my mommy! Please.I want to see my mother again.I want to see my mommy.Put the fucking
lotion in the basket!You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?No, I don't think so.I called Senator Ruth Martin.She never heard of any deal with you.They scammed you, Hannibal.Stand outside ...and shut the door.Barney.There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.I designed it.Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.Identify Buffalo Bill by name ...and if the girl is found in time,Senator Martin will have you
transferred to ...Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.Answer me, Hannibal.You answer me now, or by God,
you'll never leave this cell.Who is Buffalo Bill?His first name is Louis.I'll tell the rest to the Senator
herself, but only in Tennessee,and I have a few
conditions of my own.Clean him up and get him ready to go.Jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis.Transferred?Did you have a trainee make some
sort of phony offer to Lecter ...in the Senator's name?Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.Paul Krendler's over
here from Justice.She's asking him to
take over in Memphis.Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.You be a gentleman,
you gonna get three hots and a cot.Sir. If you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.Where is it?Here, sir. Use mine.Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Dr. Lecter,I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.You'll want to read it before I sign.I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.Clarice Starling and that
awful Jack Crawford ...have wasted far
too much time already.I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.You have my word. Paul?Buffalo Bill's real name
is Louis Friend.I met him just once.He was referred to me in April
or May, 1980,by my patient Benjamin Raspail.They were lovers, you see.But Raspail had
become very frightened.Apparently, Louis had murdered
a transient ...and done things with her skin.We need his address
and a physical description.Tell me, Senator.Did you nurse Catherine yourself?- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?- Now, wait a minute!
- Yes, I did.- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.Tell me, Mom, when your
little girl is on the slab,where will it tickle you?Take this thing back to Baltimore.Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.He'd be about 35 now.He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.That's all I can remember, Mom.But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.Oh, and, Senator,
just one more thing.Love your suit.I tell you now that in a
meeting earlier this evening ...with Senator Ruth Martin,Dr. Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation ...of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.How do you fit in, sir?Well, it's only through
my own unique insight ...into Lecter's mind that this
breakthrough was possible.And Buffalo Bill's real name ...Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.- Can you give us any more information?
- My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.- How do you spell that?
- C-H ...- Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?
- Oh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.I understand, sir.Log in. Check your weapon.Well, I can't take all
the credit for myself.Senator Martin, the Justice
Department, the people at the FBI,the folks at the
Baltimore State Hospital.And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.Command desk. Officer Jacobs.Is it true what they're saying?He's some kind of vampire?They don't have a name
for what he is.You do know the rules, ma'am?Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.Go ahead.Good evening, Clarice.I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.Just until you get your view.How very thoughtful.Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle ...before you're both
booted off the case?No. I came because I wanted to.People will say we're in love.Anthrax Island.That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.- Yours?
- Yes.Yeah! That was good.Pity about poor Catherine, though.Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.Louis Friend?Iron sulfide,
also known as Fool's Gold.Oh, Clarice. Your problem is you
need to get more fun out of life.You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.Please continue now.Well, I have read
the case files, have you?Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.Read Marcus Aurelius.Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?What is its nature?What does he do, this man you seek?He kills women.No! That is incidental.What is the first
and principal thing he does?What needs does he serve by killing?Anger.Social acceptance
and sexual frustrations ...No! He covets.That is his nature.And how do we begin
to covet, Clarice?Do we seek out things to covet?Make an effort to answer now.No. We just ...No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?All right. Yes.
Now please tell me how.No. It is your turn
to tell me, Clarice.You don't have any
more vacations to sell.Why did you leave that ranch?Doctor, we don't have any more
time for any of this now.But we don't reckon time the
same way, do we, Clarice?This is all the time
you'll ever have.Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five ...No! I will listen now.After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.You were ten years old.You went to live with cousins on
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.And?And one morning, I just ran away.Not ""just"", Clarice.
What set you off?- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?I heard a strange noise.What was it?It was screaming.Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.What did you do?I went downstairs, outside.I crept up into the barn.I was so scared to look
inside, but I had to.And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?Lambs. They were screaming.They were slaughtering
the spring lambs?And they were screaming.- And you ran away?
- No.First I tried to free them.I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.But you could and you did,
didn't you?Yes. I took one lamb,
and I ran away as fast as I could.- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know.I didn't have any food, any water,
and it was very cold, very cold.I thought if I could
save just one, but,he was so heavy.He was so heavy.I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.The rancher was so angry,he sent me to live at the
Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.I never saw the ranch again.What became of your lamb, Clarice?They killed him.You still wake up
sometimes, don't you?Wake up in the dark and hear
the screaming of the lambs.Yes.And you think if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?You think if Catherine lives,you won't wake up
in the dark ever againto that awful screaming of the lambs.I don't know. I don't know.Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.Tell me his name, Doctor.Dr. Chilton, I presume.I think you know each other.Okay.- We found her.
- Let's go!It's your turn, Doctor.- Out.
- Tell me his name.Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
I have to put you on a plane.Come on now.Brave Clarice.You will let me know when those
lambs stop screaming, won't you?Tell me his name, Doctor!Clarice!Your case file.Goodbye, Clarice.Ready when you are, Doc.Just another minute, please.The son of a bitch
demanded a second dinner.Lamb chops, extra rare.Wonder what he wants for breakfast.Some damn thing from the zoo?Good evening, gentlemen.- Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.
- Same drill as before, please.Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.Okay.Hand me that, would you?Thanks.Mind the drawings, please.Thank you.- Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!
- Jesus, Bill!Jesus Christ!Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.What is this shit?- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.Call Pembry. Ask him ...CP, shots fired on five. Repeat.- Shots fired on five.
- Sergeant Tate.Holy shit.What the hell? Bitch!Shut up.- Bobby, get the vest.
- Right, Sarge.- Brady, Howard ...
- Look!It stopped.Seal off a 10 block radius.Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.We're going up.Pembry!Boyle!Oh, God!Go.- Clear!
- Clear!Command post, two officers down.- Clear!
- Clear!Lecter's gone, Sarge.The prisoner is missing.Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.He stripped the bed.
Might be making a rope.Check all windows.Where the fuck is my ambulance?He's alive.Sergeant Tate, he's alive!Get a hold of him where you can
feel his hands, son. Talk to him.What do I say?It's Jim Pembry!
Now talk to him, damn it!Lecter is missing and armed.Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?He took Boyle's gun.
Pembry got off one round.There's a chance Lecter was hit.Keep breathing in and out.
That's it.You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.Yeah, you look ...
You look real good.- You ready?
- Let's go.- Let's do it.
- Let's go.Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.You're just fine. You're doing
all right. That's right.- Okay, I need that IV now.
- Lactated ringers.Can we get the strap?Where's the fucking oxygen?- Looking good, buddy. That's right.
- Bob!Stay with me. Stay with me here.We're losing him. Downstairs.
Take him!And up!- Elevator!
- Out of the way!Out of the way!CP to Tate.Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.He seems to be hanging on.Top three floors secured.Main stairwell secured.We think he's on two.Tate, are you still with me?We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.That's all for now. Over.He's on the roof of the elevator.Okay, guys.I see him.There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.One warning. We need him alive.Got him.Lecter.Put your hands on your head.One in the leg.No movement.Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.- We're opening the hatch.
- Watch his hands.If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.Got it.Memphis General,
this is Medical Unit 26.We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer ...with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown.We've got grand mal seizure
activity, but he's postictal now.Copy that.Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.- Ninety?
- Yeah, that's right. 90.Pulse, 84.We've got him on
lactated ringers running.And the patient is on 10 liters ...They found the ambulance in a
parking garage at Memphis Airport.The crew was dead.He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.By now he could be anywhere.- He won't come after me.
- Oh, really?No, he won't. I can't explain it.He would consider that rude.It's over. She's dead.It's not your fault it
worked out like this.The thing is that, Lecter said
everything we need ...to catch him with is right here
in these pages, only I can't ...- Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.
- He's here, Ardelia.Is this Lecter's handwriting?""Clarice, doesn't this random
scattering of sites ...""seem desperately random?
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.""Ta, Hannibal Lecter.""Desperately random?
What does he mean?Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.Yeah, but there is no pattern, or
the computers would have nailed it.They're even found in random order.Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.- Fredrica Bimmel ...
- Right.From Belvedere, Ohio.First girl taken,
third body found. Why?Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.What did Lecter say
about the first principles?Simplicity.What does this guy do?
He covets.How do we first start to covet?- We covet what we see ...
- Every day.- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.- Mr. Bimmel?
- That's me.Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.I don't know nothing new to tell you.Police been back here
so many times already.Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.She left the interview okay.
She never come home.Her bedroom's how she left it.Upstairs. Door to the left.He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr. Crawford, out of real women.And he can sew, this guy.
He's very skilled.- He's a tailor or a dressmaker or ...
- Starling ...That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive ...so he can starve them a while,so he can loosen their skin and take ...
- Starling.Starling. Starling,
we know who he is and where he is.- We're on our way right now.
- Where?Calumet City, edge of Chicago.
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.Oh, that's great news,
sir, but how ...Johns Hopkins came up
with some names.We fed him into ""Known Offenders.""Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
AKA John Grant.Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.Listen to this.Customs had some paper on him.They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX.Live caterpillars from Surinam.The addressee was a Jame Gumb.Well, Chicago's
only 400 miles from here.- I'll be there in ...
- No, no, no, Starling.There's not enough time. We want
him for murder, not kidnapping.I need you to link him to the Bimmel
girl before he's indicted.- See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
- Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.Starling, we wouldn't have found
him without you.Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.Mr. Crawford?Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.Okay, Precious.
Time for a little treat.Precious!Come on, girl!Come on, Precious.
Come on, Precious!Come on, Precious!I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.Come on. Come and get it.Precious!Are you up there, you little shit?Come and get it, pretty girl.Precious. Please come. Come on.Come on ...Would you fuck me?Come on. Take that bone. Come on.Come on. Come. Come on.I'd fuck me.Come on.I'd fuck me hard.I'd fuck me so hard.No.Is that a good job, FBI agent?You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?Sometimes you do.Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.She thought it was such hot shit.What did she know? Big dummy.Stacy, did Fredrica
ever mention a man ...named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?- How about John Grant?
- No.Oh, would she have had a friend ...that you didn't know about, or ...No way. If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.Sewing was her life.Did you two ever work together?Oh, sure. Me and Pam Malavesi
used to help her ...do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's
address? I need to talk to her.So powerful. So beautiful.Precious?Precious?Down here, you sack of shit!Put her in that bucket.No! You get me a telephone
and lower it down here. Now!Poolie-poo. Precious.Darling heart, are you all right?She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it. She's been licking ...Hey, don't you hurt my dog!- Don't you make me hurt your dog!
- Oh, you don't know what pain is!Get me a live telephone line
down here or the dog's dead!Damn fuck.Get me that telephone!I'm gonna do it, mister!I'll snap her neck off.
I swear to God!You little fuck.Down here! Down here!Help!Okay, I'm coming.We're going in.Good afternoon.
Sorry to bother you.I'm looking for
Mrs. Lippman's family.- FBI! Everybody down!
- Everybody down, now!No. The Lippmans don't
live here anymore.No. Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.- Clear!
- Clear!What's the problem, Officer?Well, I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.There's no one here, Jack.Clarice.Your name is?- Oh, Jack Gordon.
- Mr. Gordon. Good.Well, Fredrica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?No.Oh, wait.Was she a great, big fat person?- Yes. She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I ...I may have ... No, I read about
her in the newspaper.Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.I got his card in here someplace. Do you
want to come in while I look for it?- May I?
- Yeah, sure.Thank you.Are you close to catching somebody,
you think?Yes. We may be.Did youtake over this place after
Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?Yeah. I bought this house
two years ago.Did she leave any records,
any business records,tax forms, list of employees?No. Nothing like that at all.Say, has the FBI learned something?The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?No.No, we don't.Yeah. Here's that number.Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?Sure you can use my phone.Freeze!Put your hands over your head!
And turn around! Spread your legs!Spread your legs! Put your hands
in the back! Thumbs up!Freeze!Hey!Hello! Are you there?I'm down here! I'm down here!- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!FBI! You're safe!Safe, shit! Get me out of here!You're all right, Catherine.
Where is he?How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!Catherine, you've got to be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!Just get me out of here!Oh, my God.Catherine, I'm going to get you
out of there,but right now, you listen to me.I've got to leave this room.
I'll be right back.No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!No! Don't you leave me here!This guy's fucking crazy!Please!I've got to get out of here!Catherine, the other officers
will be here any minute now!Wait!Don't go! Please!Quiet!Oh, God!No ...- You okay?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?Clarice M. Starling.Congratulations.Ernest W. Stevens.- Special Agent Starling.
- Oh, Special Agent Mapp.- Phone call.
- Thank you.- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Starling.Pilch, could you take our picture?Sure.Look, I just wanted
to say congratulations.And I'm not much good
at this kind of thing,so I'm gonna duck out of here.Okay, sure.Thank you, Mr. Crawford.Your father would
have been proud today.Don't forget your phone call.Starling.Well, Clarice, have the
lambs stopped screaming?Dr. Lecter.Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.- Where are you, Dr. Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.The world's more interesting
with you in it.So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.You know I can't make that promise.I do wish we
could chat longer, but ...I'm having an old friend for dinner.Bye.Dr. Lecter ...Dr. Lecter.Dr. Lecter.Dr. Lecter.Hey, what? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.- Is the security system all set up?
- We have the big-shot security."

I'll cut her tits off!Go get Skinny! Quick!Mike, don't!Skinny!Think it's funny?Skinny, get the gun!Get off of her, cowboy.- Wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.He says he'll shoot them.
I says, ""You can't.""He says, ""Get Little Bill.""
I says, ""He's sleeping.""He says he don't care.
He'll shoot them boys soon.She gonna die?She's gonna live.She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.When she seen
his teensy little pecker ...... she giggled.
She didn't know no better.You can hang them, Little Bill.Step over to the office
and get the bullwhip.A whipping's all they get
after what they done?- It ain't no little thing, Alice.
- But what they done --Shut up!- Whipping ain't gonna settle this.
- No?Here's a contract between me
and Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.Property.Damaged property.Like if I hamstrung
one of their ponies.You think nobody'll fuck her now?Hell, no!Won't pay to do it.She can clean, but nobody's gonna pay
good money for a cut-up whore!You boys are off the Bar T.
Got your own string of ponies?Yeah, I got four.Six.You just as soon
not have a trial, no fuss?No, sir.All right.You did the cutting.Come the fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny here.Five?And you!
You bring in two.- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.Here's the bullwhip, Bill.Maybe we don't need this now.Let me tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies ... .- I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?I fined them instead, Alice.Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!That ain't fair.That ain't fair!Haven't you seen
enough blood tonight?Hell, Alice!It ain't like they was tramps or
loafers or bad men. They were just ...... hardworking boys that was foolish.- If they was given over to wickedness --
- Like whores?Tend to Delilah.Go ahead.I got $85.I don't know.If Delilah doesn't care,
why are we so riled up?Just because we let them fools
ride us like horses ...... don't mean we let them
brand us like horses.Maybe we ain't nothing but whores,
but, by God, we ain't horses!I got $112.That's everything.How about you, Faith?Two hundred.Two hundred and forty dollars.Jesus, Faith!
What you been doing?Been giving Skinny something special?She laughed.With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue --It ain't enough.Not yet, maybe.You don't look like no
rootin'-tootin' ...... son of a bitching
cold-blooded assassin.Say what?My guess is you're calling yourself
Mr. William Munny.You have me confused
with someone else, mister.The same one who shot Charlie Pepper
in Lake County?Pa! Hey, Pa!What's up, son?Two more hogs got the fever.You shot Charlie Pepper.You killed William Harvey
and robbed that train in Missouri.Hold on, mister.Son, get those hogs separated there.Penny, help your brother.- That one's sick too?
- Yeah.We'll talk inside.So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.I could have. Easy.I guess maybe so.You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.Maybe I ain't.Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son of a bitch alive.And if I wanted a partner
for a killing, you were the worst one.Meaning the best.On account as you're as cold as snow ...... and don't have
no weak nerve nor fear.Pete said that?Yeah, he did.I'm a killer myself, except ...... I ain't killed as many as you
because of my youth.Schofield Kid,
that's what they call me.Why?You from Schofield?No, it's on account ...... of my Schofield model
Smith & Wesson pistol.How about it, Will?How about what?How about being my partner?I'm heading north through Niobrara
to Wyoming to kill two no-good cowboys.For what?For cutting up a lady.
Cut up her face.Cut her eyes out,
cut her ears off.They even cut her teats.Jesus.$1,000 reward, Will.500 apiece.I can't move those damn pigs!Watch your cussing, will you?
Do the best you can with it.Then go to the pump
and get cleaned up. Come on.I ain't like that anymore, Kid.It was whiskey done it
as much as anything else.I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.My wife, she cured me of that.Cured me of drinking and wickedness.You don't look so prosperous.You could buy her a new dress
with your half.- If we kill them, you can buy your --
- She's passed on.What?Been gone near 3 years now.Don't tell no one about the reward.
I don't need other gunmen collecting.We don't see no one out here.If you was to change your mind,
I'll be riding due west ...... for the trail into Wyoming.Come on, let's separate those hogs.Two others.
I think they got the fever.Took you boys a while.A few more days and I was
gonna call on the sheriff.How about that?The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.I bet. Sleepy,
get them horses to the livery.Neil, take that one
over around the back.Now there's a beauty.You got two of mine.
This here one ain't yours.We'll see about that.Bastards!
Get out of town!Sick sons of bitches!- Don't come back, butcher!
- This here pony ...... I brung for the lady my partner cut.She's the best.Better than the ones I gave him.She can sell her ...... or do what she wants.A pony? She ain't got no face left,
you give her a mangy pony?She ain't mangy!Get out of here!We don't need your goddamn charity!Get out of our town
and don't come back!Get out of our town!Did Pa used to kill folks?I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.He ain't a saddle horse no more.
Ain't used to the feel.Take care of your sister, son.Kill a few chickens if you must.
Keep those hogs with the fever separate.If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.Ain't been in the saddle myself
in a while.She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma ...... I used to be weak
and given to mistreating animals.This horse and those hogs
over there ...... are getting even
for the cruelty I inflicted.I used to be able to cuss ...... and whip a horse, but your ma
showed me the error of my ways.I'll be back in two weeks.Remember the spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!Lying?What'll you do if somebody
comes to collect?You going to hump them
a thousand times?The kind of people who come for it
won't tolerate you not having it!They won't just cut up your face!You stupid bitches.You stupid bitches!Shit!Damn it! Jesus!Hit your finger?Hello, Skinny.Damn, you snuck up on me.What do you think of her?I heard you done the roof yourself.Roof? Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.The Roberts boy carried wood for me,
but that's all.What is all that wood?I'm building a porch
so I can sit of an evening ...... and smoke my pipe and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.Came out here just
to take a look at her?- Them whores!
- Yeah?Been humping them cowboys
who been in town the last two weeks.Shit, Skinny.We got railroad barons.
We got cattle barons.You'll be the first billiard baron.They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them ...... they'll pay $1,000 to whoever ...... kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.Those cowboys are riding that beef
down to Kansas and Cheyenne?All week long?I didn't hear till last night myself.The word's probably got all the way
to Texas by now.Nobody'll come clear from Texas.You sure they got that money?Women can lie. Asked where the
money is, they say they got none.But those five could have
squirreled it away. Maybe.That much?You could run off them two cowboys.I could run off them whores.They'll just up and run anyhow,
them two.They'll stay out at the Bar T.Close to their friends.Shit, could be nobody
won't come at all.Got to go.
I like your house.Well, I'll be ...It's Will!Come in the house out of the sun.
Sally, see to Will's horse.What are you doing here?Just thought I'd drop in on you.We ain't bad men no more.We're farmers.Should be easy killing them,
if they don't go on down to Texas.How long since you fired a gun
at a man? Nine, ten years?Eleven.Easy, huh?I don't know it was
all that easy even back then.And we was young and full of beans.If you was mad at them ...... over some wrong,
I could see shooting them.We done stuff for money before.We thought we did.What'd these fellows do?
Cheat at cards?Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?They cut up a woman.What?Cut up her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.Everything but her cunny,
I suppose.I'll be dogged.Guess they got it coming.Of course, Will ...... if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.Could you look in on my youngsters
next week?They got some hogs
they're trying to separate.How long you reckon you're gonna be?Two weeks, I guess.What's this Kid like?Three ways?I see you still have
that Spencer rifle.And I can still knock the eye
out of a bird flying too.Jesus, Will!He must be moving right along.We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.Kind of got used to my bed.This ain't going to be like no home.That ain't the only thing I'll miss.Hell, I'm sorry.Don't fret it.
It ain't nothing.She don't like it much,
you riding off with me.Gave me the evil eye.You know, Sally's injun ...... and injuns ain't over-friendly.I don't blame her.I won't hold it against her.She knew me back then.She knew what a ...... no-good son of a bitch I was.She ain't allowing that I changed.She don't realize I ain't
like that no more.- You know, Will --
- I ain't the same.Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.Going on this killing ...... don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.Just need the money.Get a new start for them youngsters.Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth ...... and his teeth came
out the back of his head?I think about him now and again.He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.You was one crazy son of a bitch.No one liked me,
and the boys all thought ...... I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.You ain't like that no more.Eagle, he hated my guts.Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.Quincy neither, I reckon.Quincy used to just watch
all the time ...... scared.Like I said ...... you ain't like that no more.That's right.I'm just a fellow now.I ain't no different
than anyone else ...... no more.What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?No, sir. The would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense ...... but the French are known
to be a race of assassins ...... who can't shoot worth a damn.Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-I-T --Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select ...... a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.The majesty of royalty, you see.Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir ...... but you are giving it pretty thick.This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.- When I heard about queens --
- Shut up, Joe.What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude --Might be that this dude
is English Bob.Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.Might be he's waiting for some cowboy
to touch his pistol ...... so he can shoot him.Is that a fact, mister?You English Bob?Pheasants.Let's shoot some pheasants.Ten shots.At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.I'll shoot for the queen, and you ...... for whomever.That's eight for me and one for you.
That comes to seven American dollars.Pretty damn good shooting ...... for a John Bull.No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief ...... over the injury to your president.It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.Does what?Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.That's the second one shot
in 20 years.It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.Thank you.Pardon me, gentlemen.The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.Proper authority?I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man ...... and the forbearance of reptiles.Unarmed, my ass!Christ, it's hot!If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.Everything hurts more when it's cold.
You know how if you hit --Shut up, Fatty!Clyde's back.- With Little Bill?
- No.Shit!- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.Where's Little Bill?Building his damn porch.Building his porch?If you got shot,
would you want it to be hot or cold?I ain't gonna get shot.He's coming?Of course he's coming.I just loaded that.I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.What'd he say?Little Bill said he was building
his porch.- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.He didn't say nothing?Asked what they looked like.Maybe he's tough,
but he ain't no carpenter.Maybe he ain't so tough.Seem like he was scared?Little Bill? Him scared?We never seen him up
against any like these ones.Killers.Little Bill come out of Kansas
and Texas, boys.He worked them tough towns.Just wondered.Anybody could be scared.He wasn't scared, boys.He just ain't no carpenter.There's a dignity in royalty ...... which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.If you pointed a pistol ...... at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.That's a wise policy.But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty ...... would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed. You would stand --How shall I put it?
In awe.A president ...
Why not shoot a president?Keep the change.This Strawberry Alice person,
tell me again.Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.Say you want a game of billiards.Billiards? Even though
I don't really wish to play?No matter. They burned the table
in '78 for firewood.Quite right.Mr. Beauchamp,
I think a cup of tea --Hello, Bob.Boys, this here is English Bob.Shit and fried eggs.Been a long time.Run out of Chinamen?I thought that you were dead.You've shaved your chin whiskers off.I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.Actually, what I heard was,
you fell off your horse ...... drunk, of course.And that you broke your bloody neck.I heard that one myself, Bob.Hell, I even thought I was dead.Till I found out
I was just in Nebraska.Who's he?W.W. Beauchamp.This is Little Bill Daggett.And friends, of course.From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?In person.You work for the railroads too?I write.Letters?Books, Bill. Books.Actually ...... he's my biographer.I wouldn't do that if I were you.It's only a book.A book?That means you boys can read.That means you saw the signs outside
town saying surrender your firearms.But like you told young Andy ...... you're not armed, are you?Not really, Bill.Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.I'm afraid so, Bob.I don't like firearms around.Be very careful with it, sonny.See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.Make sure you don't get wet.No shit.All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.The Duck of Death?Duke.""The Duke.""Good afternoon, gentlemen.I'll have that .32, Bob.Now, Little Bill ...... you will leave me at the mercy
of my enemies.Enemies?You been talking about the queen again?On Independence Day?I guess you think I'm kicking you.But it ain't so!What I'm doing is talking!You hear?!
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!To all those villains in Missouri!And those villains ...... down in Cheyenne!I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!Even if there was,
they wouldn't want to come for it ...... anyhow!What are you all looking at?!
Go on!Mind your own business!Ever go into town?On occasion.
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.I mean, get yourself a woman.No, I never go into town for that.A man like me?Only woman I could get
is one I'd have to pay for.That ain't right, buying flesh.Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that ...... me being a father.You just use your hand?I don't miss it all that much.Goddamn!
Somebody's shooting at us!Shit. Did it hit you?I bumped my head
falling off my horse.Ain't shooting at us no more.Shooting way over yonder.What the hell's he shooting at?Beats the hell out of me.Reckon we in somebody's field?I didn't see nothing planted.Shooting at us again.He's shooting at the whole horizon.Wait! You'll mark us!Hey, Kid!- That's the Kid shooting at us?
- Kid, it's me! Will Munny!What's he shooting at us for?Is that you?Yeah, it's me!Don't go shooting at us no more!
You hear me?Who the hell you got with you, Will?It's Ned Logan, my old partner!Don't go shooting at us, you hear?We'll get our horses
and come on over there.You ain't going to shoot, are you?No, I ain't!- Chased that horse a damn mile.
- What was you shooting at us for?- I thought you was following me.
- We was.- You said if I changed my mind --
- Wasn't nothing said about no partner.This here's Ned Logan.He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is, you come to kill me.We never talked about no other fellow.There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.Better than you, anyhow.You wasn't even close.Get your damn hands off my rifle!Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.It ain't bent.- You were shooting all over!
- You'll share your half with him?I figured three ways.You figured wrong.Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.You going back with him?He's my partner.He don't go, I don't go.What's it come to, three ways?Shit!What are you pissing on about?- What are you looking at, anyhow?
- Looking at?Clouds, Kid.Looking at them on account of we got
a storm riding up our ass.Hell, I seen them.You was smart to change your mind.I'm a real good shot with this rifle.See that hawk?I could hit it with one shot.Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.There ain't no hawk, Kid.You can't see for shit, can you?See your canteen?How far can you see?- Far enough.
- We ain't shooting canteens! How far?- 100 yards?
- More.- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.- He's blind!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!Hold it!How far can you see, Kid?
50 yards?You bet your ass
I can see 50 yards, Will.I can see well enough
to shoot this son of a bitch.Hold on.Hear that, Ned?Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.Jesus!50 yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.They look like real hard cases, Bob.Did you kill all seven of them?
Or just wing some of them?That you here, Bob, on the cover?""The Duck of Death""?It's the Duke.
""Duke of Death.""You always were the hell in Jesus
with a pistol, but seven of them?Protecting that woman.
How do you do that?It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain ...... liberty when depicting
the cover scene.For reasons involving the marketplace --From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.I can assure you, Mr. Daggett ...... that the events described
are from eyewitness accounts.Eyewitnesses?Like the Duck himself, I guess.The Duke.Duck, I says.""'You have insulted the honor
of this beautiful woman, Corcoran ...'... said the Duck.'You must apologize.'But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.He reached for his pistols
and would have killed him ...... but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns.""I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.There is a certain poetry to
the language which I couldn't resist.I was in the Blue Bottle Saloon
in Wichita ...... the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.I didn't see you there.Nor no woman.Nor two-gun shooters.- Nor none of this.
- You were there?Yeah, I was there.First off ...... Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.It was because his dick ...... was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what ...... Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky. He did the wrong thing.He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.Meantime, Bob here ...... aims real good
and squeezes off another ...... but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $1,000 mirror over the bar.The Duck of Death is as good as dead
because Corky does it right.He aims real careful.- No hurry.
- And?That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there ...... to defend himself to the end.Wait a minute.English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have ...Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.No, he just walked over there
real slow ...... because he was drunk ...... and shot him
through the liver.Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!You'll miss your dadgum roof next,
I suppose.Shit!That business up in Jackson County,
that really happen?- The way they say it happened?
- What business?There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.Got you dead to rights.You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.Only took a scratch yourself.Uncle Pete never seen
nothing like it ...... shooting your way out
of that scrape.I don't recollect.You don't recollect?That's right.Ned ...... how many men you killed?Ain't you gonna answer?What the hell's that to you?To know the kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape.- How many men you killed, Kid?
- Five.How many?Five!I done killed five of them.That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.You boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck --Than English Bob?Faster?
Faster was his mistake.If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have
shot himself in the toe.He would've killed old Bob.Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol ...... don't do no harm, but it don't mean
much next to being cool-headed.A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire ...... like as not he'll kill you.- But if the other fellow is quicker --
- Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.Look here.That's as fast as I can draw, aim, hit
anything more than 10 feet away.Unless it's a barn.But if he doesn't miss?He'll kill you.That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.Like me.It ain't so easy to shoot a man
if he's shooting back.That'll flat rattle some folks.Let me show you something.Look here.
Take that.Go on, take it.There's the key.Just shoot me ...... and you and Bob can ride on
out of here free as birds.- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.First, you got to cock it.Go on, cock it.Now you got to point it.Go on. Point it.Now all you got to do
is pull the trigger.Hot, ain't it?Didn't even put your finger
on the trigger.What if ...?What if I gave it to him?Give it to him.- You don't really want me to --
- Give it to him.I guess he don't want it.You were right not to take it.I'd have killed you.We could use some rain.You no-good, goddamn
pig-fucking whore!Sorry, old horse.I brung this for when we kill
them fellows.Figured we could use some now.Not me. I don't touch it no more.- Come on, it's raining.
- I know it's raining!Give some to the Kid.You think that Kid
really killed five men?No.When he talked about the time
them deputies had the drop on you ...I remember there was three men
you shot, not two.I ain't like that no more, Ned!I ain't no crazy killing fool.Still think it'll be easy
to kill them cowboys?If we don't drown first.Give these keys to the conductor.He can loose Bob's cuffs
as soon as he's outside the county.Got my pistols?I guess you know, Bob ...... that if I see you again
I'll just shoot in self-defense.I didn't steal your biographer!He's staying on his own account!He can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!The plague on the whole
stinking lot of you!Without morals or laws!And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!It's no wonder you all
emigrated to America!Because they wouldn't have you
in England!You're a lot of savages!You're all a bunch of bloody savages!
A curse on you!Nobody's going to come ...... after what Little Bill done
to that Englishman.Delilah, can't you get
them tables clean?Cover your face, somebody might hump
you and you wouldn't have to clean.- What do they call that face cover?
- A veil.Yeah. Get a veil!Rain's coming.Thank God.You sure?You all right, Will?Fellow asking for you.Tonight?
You ain't joshing?This way, mister.Must be randy as hell
to come out in this shit.""No, no! You're wrong, Little Bill!""
he said.""That's not a Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!""He had changed it over.
And I said to him:""Jim, you're a liar and a horse thief!""When he saw nobody would help him,
he started crying ...... and sobbing
and just carrying on.He said, ""God, please,
don't kill me, Bill!""So I said, ""Jim, it makes me sick ...""Open the window, will you?""... to see a man carrying
two pistols and a Henry rifle ...... and crying like a damn baby.""- So you killed him?
- No.But I should have.I can't abide them kind.You see them in the taverns.Tramps and drunk teamsters.Crazed miners.Sporting their pistols and acting
like they was bad men.But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.I do not like assassins.Or men of low character.Like your friend, English Bob.But, now Bob was no coward.He wouldn't cry
and carry on like that --Sheriff ... .I don't have any more receptacles.Maybe you should hang the carpenter.What?I was just saying because of the ...
You hang ...Doesn't matter.What the hell?On a night like this!- Who the hell is it?
- Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.Three fellows just come into town.
They're down to Greely's.At least two of them got guns.What the hell's keeping that Kid?You don't suppose he's up --Jesus, Will!You look like shit.You remember Eagle Hendershot?I saw him.Will, he's dead.No, I saw him, Ned.His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.Jesus! You got a fever.- Take a drink, will you?
- Worms were coming out.Look, I'm going up to see
what's keeping the Kid.Must be getting an advance
from one of the sporting ladies.If I was to ...If it worked out that I could take
a little time for myself ...I mean you wouldn't ...I guess you wouldn't want to come.Give me the pistol.I says give me over your pistol.I ain't drunk.Ordinance says you got to turn in
your firearms to my office ...... day or night.I guess you didn't see the sign,
because of the weather.No.But I ain't ...I ain't armed.What about your friends upstairs?
They got any pistols?They ain't armed either.Spilled your whiskey.What's your name?William ...... Hendershot.Well, Mr. William Hendershot ...... what if I was to say you was
a no-good son of a bitch and a liar?And if I was to say you shit in your
pants because of a cowardly soul ...... I bet you'd show me that pistol
quick and kill me. Isn't that so?Maybe, yeah, I guess.But the fact is ...... I ain't carrying no firearm.Get up.What's this for,
snakes and such?We don't have any snakes in here,
Mr. Hendershot.It ain't loaded or ...
Powder's wet.You see, Mr. Beauchamp?This is the trash
I was speaking of!They're in all the saloons
in all your prosperous communities!Wichita!Over in Cheyenne!Abilene!But not in the town of Big Whiskey.Hurry up!
You know what to tell Bill.Look for that lone pine.
Miss the pine, you won't find it.Forget the shirt!
Put the boots on!- What are we going to do about Will?
- Come on, Kid!Let's hope them horses are still there!Let the man out, W.W.He's desiring to leave the hospitality
of Big Whiskey behind him.Easy!- She's got to turn a dollar a time.
- Why'd they lit out the back window?They seen you beating on their friend.- They come for the billiards, honest.
- Billiards?!- They were just passing through?
- They was going to Fort Buford.You kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.Innocent?Innocent of what?Jesus, Ned! You done this before?Plenty of times.His pistol must've jammed.Here. Bring that candle in closer.
I can't see.He wouldn't take no beating
if it hadn't jammed.He wouldn't give it over
and not shoot.He don't look so good.He didn't even pull his pistol?- He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
- I'd have pulled my pistol.You did!
Out of the lady and out the window!- That was your idea! I --
- We got to go.What? I'm ready for another advance.- You'll use it all up.
- No more advances on what you ain't done.Sweetheart, we're just waiting
on this weather to clear!We're going to need more food!
About three days' worth.Three days?We can kill them tomorrow.- I don't kill nobody without him.
- We don't need him! We can do it.Besides ...... he ain't nothing
but a broken-down pig farmer.We'll bring food in the morning,
and some whiskey too!And some medicine if you got any!Don't it make you sick hearing him?Don't you ladies worry!Me and Ned, we'll kill them two
sons of bitches for you!Claudia.- Claudia's not here.
- Is that you, Ned?I seen him.I seen the Angel of Death.I seen a river, Ned.- He's got snake eyes.
- Who's got snake eyes?It's the Angel of Death.I'm scared of dying.Easy, partner.I seen Claudia too.That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?Her face was all covered with worms.Ned, I'm scared.I'm dying.You won't --
No, don't tell nobody.Don't tell my kids ...... none of the things I done.
You hear me?All right, Will.He's gonna die, ain't he?Maybe.Supposing he does?We'll bury him.That ain't what I mean.You mean, will I help
you kill them cowboys?I can't spot them myself.But you could.That big bastard, you could spot him
a half-mile off, I bet.And if I spot him?Then I ride up close and shoot him.Just like that?I'm a damn killer.
I done it before.I'm more of a killer than he is.Yeah?I thought you was an angel.You ain't dead.Some big fellow ...... kicked the hell out of me.I must look like you now.You don't look nothing like me.No offense meant.You got to be the one
those cowboys cut up.My partners, Ned and that Kid ...... they around?They went out scouting
when your fever broke.Scouting?Out to the Bar T ...... looking for them.How long I been here?Three days.Are you hungry or ...?Three days?I ought to be ...I thought I was gone.I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this ...... trees,
but I'm sure noticing now.Thought I was dying for sure.I brought your hat.You left it down at Greely's.Thanks.That sheriff ...- He still looking for me?
- Little Bill?No, he thinks you went south.Are you really gonna
kill them cowboys?I guess.Still a payment coming, isn't there?Them other two, your friends ...... they been taking
advances on the payment.Advances?- Free ones.
- Free ones?Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.I see.Would you like a free one?No. I guess not.I didn't mean with me.
I meant ...... Alice and Silky would be happy
to give you a free one if you wanted.That's all I meant.I didn't mean ...... I didn't want a free one
because you been cut up and all.What I said about you looking like me,
that ain't true.You ain't ugly like me.It's just that we both got scars.You're a beautiful woman,
and if I wanted a free one ...... I'd want it with you
more than the other two.It's just that ...... I can't on account of my wife.Your wife?Yeah. You see?I admire you for that.For being true to your wife.I've known a lot of men ...... who weren't.I suppose.Is she back in Kansas?Yeah.She's watching over my young ones.- Hang on!
- Get the damn iron!Jesus, fellas!Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!I'm pinned, boys!Better finish him, Ned.He ain't dead? You didn't get him?He got the boy's horse.Finish him before he gets clear.Get behind them rocks.Get over there!What happened? He ain't killed?!
What's going on?He gets in those rocks,
we won't get him.- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?Shoot!I ain't very good with one of these.Keep going, Davey! The rocks!Did you get him?Where is he?How many more shots do I have?- Two.
- Two.Did you get him?Here, reload this.- You missed him.
- I got him.They shot me, boys.He ain't killed.Maybe, maybe not.Got him through the gut, I think.Think he'll die?You think we killed him?Yeah.We killed him, I guess.I'm dying, boys!Then you shouldn't have cut up
no woman, you asshole!Jesus, I'm so thirsty!Give me some water, please!Please, Slim!I'm bleeding, Slim!Give him a drink of water,
goddamn it!Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't gonna shoot!- You ain't gonna shoot?
- No.Hold on, Davey-boy!Here I come now!Don't shoot me,
you bastards!Shit!They take him water?Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!Hold on now!You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!When will we double back?After a ways.Not me.- I'm heading back down to Kansas.
- We got to kill the other one first.With any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.We'll shoot him and head back
with the money.- Do you want the Spencer?
- It's no time to quit.- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!I'll see you, Will.
So long, Kid.Here. I ain't no good
with that damn thing.Me and the Kid'll head over
to that ranch and we'll shoot him.We'll meet up with you,
get our money, and go back together.Suppose he don't go back
to the ranch?He ain't going into town
or stay out in the open country.He'll hole up at that ranch.I ain't waiting.I'll look in on your young ones.Forget what the Kid said
about the money.I'll bring your share.Kid's full of shit.Just doing some repairs up here.They killed one of them cowboys.Shit!Parson said he saw three men,
right after sunup, headed east.One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten gray.He didn't know what the third one
was on, maybe an appaloosa.Amos says to ask if the county
will pay for feed for all the horses.Witherspoon won't sell us
no more shells without pay.Hell, use my dogs!Then the county's got
to be responsible.Get on out there to the Bar T
and make sure that other cowboy ...... stays put
and don't expose himself.I didn't think they'd really do it.Think they come up
from Kansas to fuck us?That Kid, he's just a boy
and the other one ...... Will, the nice one,
being so true to his wife ...Wife?
He ain't got no wife.- Yes, he does. He --
- He ain't got no wife.Not above ground, anyways.Murdering whores!He had it coming!
He had it coming for what he done!And the other one too!
Both of them for what they done!We got one!We got one, sheriff!
Out by Cow Creek!- Is he alive?
- Hell, yeah!Bunch of us from Bar T went looking
because they killed one of our own.Come across the bastard
on a roan heading south.He admit it?No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.They messing him up?Little bit.Get out there. Find out what happened
to those other two!See anything out there, Buck?Hell, yes!
Seen about 200 fellows packing rifles.Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.I said, ""How much?"" They says, ""Five.""
I said, ""Dollars?""They said, ""Cents.""I said, ""Sold.""Well, I ain't worried!Because I got me some protection.- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.- Any names?
- Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.Bring him in.You'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here ...... all about your two friends.I'll want the names and whereabouts
of those son of a bitches.Sure is ripe.Going to get a lot riper.Think he's still in there?He's in there.He's holding on to his shit
like it was money.He's in there.Tell me right off if you see him.You won't shoot him your own self?You can shoot him.Now you and Mr. Quincy and ...What was the young fellow's name?Elroy Tate.No, that's not what you said.- Hell if it ain't!
- No, you said:""Elroy Quincy out of Medicine Hat ...... and Henry Tate out of Cheyenne.""Hell if I did.Go get them whores that pumped
these boys that night.Strawberry Alice and Silky?Go on and get them!Them whores are going to tell
different lies than you.And when their lies
ain't the same as your lies ...Well, I ain't going to hurt no woman.But I'm going to hurt you.Not gentle like before ...... but bad.Where you going?- The shithouse.
- Let me finish.To protect me while I take a dump?- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.- I'll go.
- Yeah, you can wipe my ass, Thirsty.Hell with him. He ain't polite,
he should get shot.Is that him?Yeah, that's him.All right, Kid. Go get him.
He's all yours.Assassins!Shoot him!Come on, goddamn it!Did you get him?Cover me.- I can't see them!
- Just shoot!Was it like that in the old days?Everybody riding out, shooting ...... smoke all over, folks yelling,
bullets whizzing by?I guess so.Shit, I thought they'd get us.I was even scared a little.For a minute.You ever scared in them days?I can't remember.I was drunk most of the time.I shot that fucker three times!He was taking a shit,
went for his pistol and I blazed away.First shot ...... I got him right in the chest.- Say, Will?
- Yeah?That was the first one.First one what?First one I ever killed.Yeah?You know how I said I shot five men?It weren't true.That Mexican with the knife?I just busted his leg with a shovel.
I didn't kill him or nothing.You sure killed
the hell out of that fellow today.Hell, yeah!Killed the hell out of him, didn't I?Three shots and he was taking a shit.Take a drink, Kid.Jesus Christ!It don't seem real.How he ain't gonna
never breath again, ever.How he's dead.And the other one too.On account of pulling a trigger.It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.You take away all he's got ...... and all he's ever gonna have.I guess they had it coming.We all have it coming, Kid.I was watching
that you weren't followed.Silky and Faith rode off to the east
and two deputies followed them.- You want to help me count this?
- I trust you.Don't go trusting me too much.In fact, we'll give Ned his share
together.You'll know I ain't holding out on you.Ned's share?He went south.
We'll catch up.He's dead.What do you mean, dead?He went south yesterday.
He ain't dead.They killed him.
I thought you knew.Nobody killed Ned!He didn't kill anyone.
He went south!Why would anybody kill Ned?Who killed him?Little Bill.The Bar T boys caught him ...... and Little Bill beat him up.He was making him answer questions,
beating him up. Then Ned just died.They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.A sign on him?In front of Greely's.A sign on him in front of Greely's!These questions he was asking ...... what kind were they?About where you and him was.Then what?A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse.So Little Bill killed him
for what we done?Not on purpose.But he started hurting him worse.
Making him tell stuff.First, Ned wouldn't talk.Then Little Bill hurt him so bad,
he said who you was.He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.Little Bill said, ""The one
who dynamited ...... the railroad in '69,
killing women and children?""Ned said you done a lot worse.
Said you was ...... more cold-blooded than Will Bonney.
Said if he hurt Ned again ...... you'd come kill him
like you killed a U.S. marshal in '70.That didn't scare him, did it?No, sir.Give me your Schofield.What for, Will?- Give it to me.
- Yeah. Sure.You want it, keep it.I won't use it.I won't kill nobody no more.I ain't like you, Will.You better ride on back, miss.Go on, keep all of it.
It's yours.What about spectacles
and fancy clothes?I'd rather be blind and ragged
than dead.You don't have to worry, Kid.
I ain't going to kill you.You're the only friend I got.Take this money and give my half
and Ned's half to my kids.Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
to give half to Sally.You keep the rest.
Get them spectacles.You'll go kill Little Bill?Stay clear of folks you see.
There'll be a lot out to hang you.Get going.I'll say this just one more time,
so don't ask me again!Those on today's posse got one drink
coming from the county budget!And those who rode yesterday
get one for that too.Hold it!That's two! After that, it comes
out of your own pocket! You hear?- Yes, sir.
- We'll pull out early in the morning.We'll chase them clear to Texas,
so don't spend too much money.We'll divide up into four parties!We'll hit all the farms and trails
in a big circle.We're bound to find somebody
who's seen these skunks.Who owns this shithole?You, fat man. Speak up.I own this establishment.I bought it from Greely for $1,000.Better clear out.Hold it!Sir, you are a cowardly
son of a bitch!You just shot an unarmed man.He should've armed himself ...... if he's going to decorate his saloon
with my friend.You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri ...... killer of women and children.That's right.I killed women and children.Killed just about everything
that walks or crawls.And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.For what you did to Ned.You boys better move away.All right, gentlemen.
He's got one barrel left.When he fires it,
use your pistols ...... and shoot him down
like the mangy scoundrel he is!Misfire! Kill the son of a bitch!Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.I'm shot! I'm shot!You ain't shot.I don't have a gun.
I am not armed.Pick up that rifle.Pick it up.Shells too.You killed Little Bill.Sure you ain't armed?I'm not.
I don't have a gun.I've never had a gun.
I'm a writer!A writer?- Letters and such?
- Books.Books.I don't believe it, you killed five men.
Single-handed.- That's a Spencer rifle, right?
- Right.Who'd you kill first?""When confronted by superior numbers ...... an experienced gunfighter will
fire on the best shot first.""Little Bill said that.
You probably killed him first.I was lucky in the order.I'm always lucky
when it comes to killing folks.That so? Who was next?
Clyde, right?You killed Clyde,
or it was Deputy Andy --All I can tell you is,
who'll be last.I don't deserve this.To die like this.I was building a house.Deserve's got nothing to do with it.I'll see you in hell, William Munny.Yeah.All right, I'm coming out!Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!Anyone takes a shot at me ...... I'm not only going to kill him,
but his wife and all his friends.And burn his damn house down!Nobody better shoot!Charley, go ahead.
Shoot him!I can't.Hell, no!
I ain't no deputy!You better bury Ned right!You better not cut up
nor otherwise harm no whores!Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons of bitches."

they're here and waitin' to see you.OK, Ma. I'll be home in two minutes.Listen, Ma, tell Thomas to stick around.
I wanna see him.OK. You come on home, huh? OK.Marty's coming home.So what happened about this milk bottle
was, my mother-in-law is in the kitchen,she begins pokin' her head
over my shoulder here and there.Then she tells me how I waste money, I
can't cook and I'm raisin' my baby wrong.She got me so nervous
I spilled the milk for the baby.Tommy, your mother is my sister, but...So she says ""You're spillin' the milk.""
She kept talkin' about these drops of milk.Finally she got me so mad I said ""Mama,
you wanna see me really spill milk?""So I picked up the bottle
and I threw it at the door.I didn't throw it at her.
That's something she made up.She tells everybody
I threw a bottle of milk at her.I didn't throw it anywheres near her.Anyway, I was sorry,
but she ran out of the house and I...I don't know what you want me to do, but,
if you want me to, I come and talk to her.- Well, Aunt Theresa, we...
- Let me tell it, Tommy.OK.Aunt Theresa, we want you
to do a very big favour for us.Sure.Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here.You got this big house
just for you and Marty.I thought Tommy's mother
could come and live with you and Marty.- Well...
- I talked to Tommy's brotherand I said ""You gotta take her for
a couple of years!"" And he says ""Oh, no!""- I sound terrible...
- No, Virginia. I know how you feel.I just can't stand it any more! Every
minute of the day! Do this! Do that!I don't have ten minutes privacy with
my husband. We can't even have a fight.We don't have any privacy!- All right, Ginnie. Don't get so excited.
- She's right, Tommy.A young husband and wife
should have their own home.And my sister Caterina, well... she's my
sister, but I must say she's an old goat.And plenty of time in my life I feel like
throw the milk bottle at her myself.But I tell you right now, if Caterina wants
to come and live here with Marty and me,it's all right with me.That's very nice of you, Aunt Theresa.- Of course, we gotta ask Marty first.
- Sure, sure.Sit here. I go in the kitchen
and turn a little fire under the cooking.That's very nice of you, Aunt Theresa.How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?Oh, he's fine.
You know a nice girl he can marry?Oh, don't worry. He'll get married.I don't know.
He sits around the house all the time.You know a nice place
where he can go to get a bride?There's the Stardust Ballroom.
That's a big dance hall.Every Saturday night
it's loaded with girls. It's a nice place.You pay 77 cents. Well, it used to be 77
cents. Probably a dollar and a half now.You go in and ask some girl to dance.It's a respectable...
That's where I met Virginia.You tell Marty to go to the Stardust
Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.""The Stardust Ballroom.
It's loaded with tomatoes.""Right.Aunt Theresa, this is so nice of you.
I want you to know we appreciate it.He's here.- Hello, Marty.
- Hello, Ma.Thomas and Virginia are here.They just had another big fight
with your Aunt Caterina,so they ask me if it's OK
Caterina come live here.I said all right with me,
but we gotta ask you.Marty, she's a lonely old woman.
Nobody wants her.Everybody's throwing her out they house.- Well, sure, Ma. It's OK with me.
- You got a good heart.- Marty say it's all right she come here.
- Thanks. Takes a load off of my mind.- We got plenty of room here.
- Oh, it's gonna be nice.I come over tonight, I talk to Caterina.
Everything is gonna work out all right.I wanna thank you
because it was becoming impossible.Sit down, Thomas. Sit down.Marty, I appreciate what you
and your mother are doing because...- Oh.
- No, listen. What was happening...Virginia was makin' milk and my mother...- I promised the baby-sitter six o'clock.
- OK.- Before you go, I need some advice.
- Sure. What?Well, you're the accountant in the family.
My boss wants to sell his shop to me.- Oh, yeah?
- Well, him and his wife live alone.They wanna move out to California
and live near their married daughter.Well, he wants $5,000 down, although
I think I can knock him down to four.Tommy!Marty, I gotta run now,
but I'll meet you at mass tomorrow.Afterwards we'll discuss it.
It sounds like a good proposition.- OK. He wants an answer by Monday.
- Oh, sure.We'll work out an arrangement
about my mother. I wanna pay you...- No, listen...
- Tommy!We'll talk about it later. Thanks again.- Goodbye, Marty.
- Goodbye, Virginia. See ya soon.- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa.
- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa. Thank you.Hello. Is this Mary Feeney?Well, could I speak to Miss Mary Feeney?Just tell her an old friend.Oh, hello there. Is this Mary Feeney?Hello there. This is Marty Piletti.
I wonder if you recall me.Well, I'm kind of a stocky guy. The last
time we met was in the RKO Chester.You was with a friend of yours and
I was with a friend of mine name of Angie.This was about a month ago.The RKO Chester on West Farms Square.Yeah, you was sittin' in front of us and
we was annoyin' ya and you got mad.I'm the fella who works in a butcher shop.Oh, come on, you know who I am.That's right! And then we went to
Howard Johnson's. You had a milk shake.Yeah, that's right.
I'm the stocky one, the heavyset fella.Yeah. Well, I'm glad you recall me,
because I had a pretty nice time that nightand I was wonderin'
how everything was with you.How's everything?That's swell.Yeah, well, I'll tell you why I called.
I was figurin' on takin' in a movie tonightand I was wonderin' if you and your friend
would care to see a movie tonightwith me and my friend.Yeah, tonight.I know it's a little late to call for a date,
but I didn't know myself till...Yeah, I know.Yeah, well, what about...Well, how about next Saturday night?
Are you free next Saturday night?Well, what about the Saturday after that?Yeah.Yeah, I know.Oh, I mean, I understand that...Yeah.Yeah.So, what are you
gonna do tonight, Marty?I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out.
I may just hang around the house.Why don't you go to
the Stardust Ballroom?What?I say ""Why don't you go to the Stardust
Ballroom?"" It's loaded with tomatoes.- It's loaded with what?
- Tomatoes.Who told you about
the Stardust Ballroom, Ma?- Tommy. He say it's very nice place.
- Oh, Thomas!Ma, it's just a big dance hall, that's all.
I been there a hundred times.Loaded with tomatoes!
Boy, you're funny, Ma.Marty, I don't want you
hanging around the house tonight.- I want you go shave and go dance.
- Ma, when are you gonna give up?- You got a bachelor on your hands.
- You gonna get married.Ma, sooner or later there comes a point
in a man's life when he's gotta face facts.One fact I gotta face is
whatever it is women like, I ain't got it.I chased after enough girls in my life.
I went to enough dances.I got hurt enough.
I don't wanna get hurt no more.I just called up a girl this afternoon.
I got a real brushoff, boy.I figured I was past the point
of bein' hurt, but that hurt.Some stupid woman who I didn't even
wanna call up. She gave me the brush.I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom.All that ever happened to me there
was girls made me feel like I was a bug.I got feelings, you know.
I had enough pain. No, thanks, Ma.- Marty...
- No.I'm gonna stay home tonight.- You gonna die without a son.
- So I'll die without a son.- Marty, put on the blue suit, huh?
- Blue suit, grey suit.I'm just a fat, little man. A fat, ugly man.- You not ugly.
- I'm ugly! I'm ugly! I'm ugly!- Marty.
- Ma! Leave me alone!Ma, what do you want from me?
I'm miserable enough as it is.All right, I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom.
I'll put on a blue suit and go.You know what I'm gonna get for my
trouble? Heartache. A night of heartache!Loaded with tomatoes!That's rich.- Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
- Yeah.There was a nice-lookin' one over there
with the black dress on.But she's dancin' now.Hey, there's a nice-lookin',
little short one for you down there.- Where?
- Down there. That little one down there.Oh, yeah.What do you say? Wanna ask 'em?I'll take the one
with the flowers on her dress.Well, I think this music's a little fast.Just a minute.Yeah, I think it's all right.
Are they still over there?What do you say? You wanna dance?Uh, excuse me. Would you care to dance?- I don't feel like dancin' just yet.
- Sure.Clara, have you decided about tomorrow?Millie, I always go to the movies
with Papa on Sunday.- I know, but you could have a lot of fun.
- I'm gonna get some cigarettes.Herb, I told you she wasn't especially
attractive, but she had a lot of charm.Look, Herb, she's a real nice kid.She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get
one Saturday night off every three weeks.I was expecting somethin' better.- D'you like him, Clara?
- Yes. He seems very nice.- Millie's been after me to fix her up.
- All right, I'm having a fair time.I get one Saturday night off in three weeks
and I wanted to wind up with something.- OK. So I'm sorry.
- Forget it.- Herbie, have you ever been here before?
- Hey!Herbie!- What are you doing here?
- I came up to dance. What do you think?- You here with somebody?
- I'm just here with another girl.- Where you goin' now?
- For some cigarettes. Left 'em in my coat.- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, I'll see ya.Oh, that's a... girl I used to know.- Boy, it's sure packed in here.
- Some of these kids are awfully young.You might run into one of your students.I wouldn't think so.
I teach out in Brooklyn.- Oh, you been here before, Clara?
- Yes. Twice.You wanna try and get a table and a drink,
or you just wanna start dancing?Well, Herb... Herb! What do you say?
We grab a table before we dance?Listen, you people go grab a table.
I'll be back in a minute.I'll be right back.What do you say, Clara, huh?
Come on, we'll grab a table.- You here stag or with a girl?
- You say somethin'?Yeah. I was askin' you
if you was here stag or with a girl.- Oh, I'm stag.
- I got stuck on a blind date with a dog.I just met an old girl I used to know,
so I need to get rid of the girl I'm with.Somebody to take her home,
you know what I mean?- I'd pay you $5 if you take her home.
- What?I'll introduce you as an old army buddy
of mine and then I'll cut out,because I got this other girl waiting for
me by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you $5.- Are you kiddin'?
- No, I'm not kiddin'.You just can't walk off on a girl like that!As long as she's goin' home alone,
give me the $5 back.Look, Mac, you paid me the $5.
The $5 is mine.Excuse me, miss,
but would you care to dance?Miss?- You come up here often?
- I was up here twice before.Once I came up with a friend of mine
and... once alone.The last time...You see that girl sitting over there
in the grey dress?Yeah.Well, the last time I was here,
that's where I sat.I sat there for an hour and a half
without moving a muscle.Now and then some fellow would kind of
come up to me and then change his mind.I'll never forget just sitting there for an
hour and a half with my hands in my lap.Then I began to cry.
I had to get up and go home.I've begun to cry a lot lately.I cry a lot, too. I'm a big crier.This is something recent with me, this
bursting into tears at the slightest thing.I cry all the time, any little thing.My brothers, my brothers-in-law always
tell me what a good-hearted guy I am.You're not good-hearted by accident.You get kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.I know exactly how you feel.I also want you to know I'm having a good
time with you and really enjoyin' myself.So, you see, you're not such a dog
as you think you are.I'm having a very good time, too.So there you are. So I guess
I'm not such a dog as I think I am.No, you're a very nice guy.I don't know why some girl
hasn't grabbed you off long ago.Well, I don't know either.
I think I'm a very nice guy.I also think I'm a pretty smart guy
in my own way. Excuse me.I figure two people get married and
they're gonna live together 40, 50 years,so it's gotta be more than
whether they're just good-lookin' or not.You think you're not so good-lookin'.Well, my father was a real ugly man,
but my mother adored him.She told me how she'd get so miserable
sometimes, like everybody, you know?And she says my father
always tried to understand.I used to see them sometimes when
I was a kid sittin' in the livin' room talkin',and I used to adore my old man,
because he was always so kind.That's one of the most beautiful things I
have in my life - the way my parents were.And my father was a real ugly man.So it doesn't matter
if you look like a gorilla.See, dogs like us,
we ain't such dogs as we think we are.I'm 29 years old.How old are you?I'm 34.- Oh, hello, Aunt Theresa. Come on in.
- Is Caterina here?We didn't say anything.
We thought we'd leave it to you.We thought you'd put it like how you were
lonely and why doesn't she live with you.That way it looks like she's doing you
a favour, instead of we're throwin' her out.- You want Tommy and me to stay?
- No. It's better idea if you and Tommy go,otherwise she's gonna start to fight
with you and everybody be yelling.- Hello, Aunt Theresa.
- Hello, Thomas.Who's there? Who's there?- It's me, Caterina! How you feel?
- Hey, what are you doin' here?I come to see you. How you feel?I got a pain on my left side
and my leg throbs like a drum.- I been getting pain in my shoulder.
- Hah! I got a pain in my shoulder, too.I got a pain in my hip and
my right arm aches so much I can't sleep.Ah, it's a curse to be old.We got a postcard from
my son Nicky and his bride.They are in Florida in a big hotel
on their honeymoon.I got a letter from
my husband's cousin in Abruzzi.- His mother die.
- Oh.You remember Emilio DiGiorgio,
who own a tavern in Abruzzi?- He die.
- Oh.- You know who else die?
- Who?You know the old man who live upstairs
in this house? Irishman, always drunk.He get pleurisy. He stay two weeks
in a hospital. Yesterday he die.I like to visit you, Caterina, because
you always got such cheerful news.Hey, kids. Why don't you two kids
go to the movies?Your mother and me, we be baby-sitter.- Let's go down to the Kaplans'.
- Sure, sure.Ma, we'll be down at the Kaplans'
if you want us for anything. OK?I wake up this morning.
I hear the baby cry, so I wake up.I come in their room, and that girl,
she's shakin' her hand at the baby.I said ""You brute! Don't you strike
that baby! That's my son's baby!""- It's her baby, too.
- It's my son Thomas's baby.But it's not your baby.I tell you she throw a bottle of milk at me?I know. I know.She's a witch, that one, I tell you.- I tell you what she do yesterday?
- What?- She give me the evil eye.
- Uffa Caterina.I keep one eye open when I sleep,
because she's gonna stab me in my bed.Caterina, I want you to come
and live with me in my house.Hm?Your son Thomas and his wife,
they come to my house today.They say things
are no good in this house.Caterina, your son is married.Leave him in peace.
He wants to be alone with his wife.They don't want no old woman
sittin' in the balcony.My son Thomas
come to see you this afternoon,and he say to you he's gonna
throw his mother from this house?Ooh, Caterina,
don't make an opera out of this.The three of you and a little baby
in three skinny little rooms.You know this is no good - old woman
living with a husband and wife.Two women in the same kitchen,
the house burns up.So I'm an old garbage bag
put in the street, huh?Caterina, don't make a tragedy.Come and live in my house where
you know you be more happier yourself.It pains they should do this.I know it pains.These are the worst years, I tell you.Caterina, you are very dear to me.We cried lots of times together.When my poor husband, he die,
I would be crazy if not for you.I ask you to come to my house,
because I know I can make you happy.Please come to my house, Caterina.These are the worst years, I tell you.It's gonna happen to you.I'm afraid to look in a mirror.I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with
white hair, like the old ladies in the park -little bundles in black shawl,
waiting for the coffin.I'm 56 years old,
and what I got to do with myself?I got strength in my hands.
I wanna clean, I wanna cook.I wanna make dinner for my children.Am I an old dog to lay near the fire
till my eyes close?These are terrible years, Theresa.
Terrible years.Caterina, listen...It's gonna happen to you.
It's gonna happen to you!What are you gonna do
if Marty gets married, huh?What are you gonna cook?Where's all the children playin'
in all the rooms? Where's the noise?It's a curse to be a widow. A curse!What are you gonna do
if Marty gets married?What are you gonna do?I'm gonna put my things in a bag,and I come to you tomorrow.Don't worry. We'll come right back.You teach chemistry? What school?- Benjamin Franklin High School.
- In Brooklyn?I went to Theodore Roosevelt
on Fordham Road. It's near my house.I have a cousin who's a teacher.
He teaches Latin.He was studying to be a priest,
but he gave it up.I was pretty good in high school.
I sound like a jerk now.I got an 82 average. That ain't bad.I was accepted at City College, but
my old man died, so I had to go to work.Want some cigarettes?German was my best class.
That was my best language.Der, die, das. Des, der, des.
There you are, I still remember.You know what I was
good at in high school? Math.You know how long ago
I graduated high school? June 1937.Holy cow! June 1937!
What is that? 15... 17 years ago!Holy cow! Seven... Let's see, is that right?
Yeah, 17. That's right.Where'd it all go? I'm gettin' old. I'm
gonna be 35 years old November 8th. 35!Wow! Time goes on, boy!Yeah. 19... June 1937.My old man died December 1937.
Two o'clock in the mornin', he died.Bell rings. I knew somethin' was wrong
because my room is on the ground floor.I had to get outta bed to answer the door,
and there was Mr Stern.He had a house down about a block away
from us. He moved out, though.My old man played cards with him and
some other guys. He was a Jewish fella.So he said ""Is your mother home?""
So I knew there was somethin' wrong.I was only 18, exactly 18 years old
just a month before.So I said ""Is something wrong, Mr Stern?""
I was in my pyjamas.So he said ""Marty, your father died.""My father died right in the middle
of playin' cards, at the table.He had a heart attack.
He had low blood pressure.He used to faint a lot, you know.Boy... Boy, am I talkin'!Excuse me.
I never talked so much in all my life.Usually everybody tells me their troubles.Well, I'm gonna shut up now
and let you get a word in.Yeah, 17 years ago.What I been doin' with myself
all that time?Well, there I go again!
I must be drivin' you crazy.Most of the time I'm with a girl
I... I can't find a word to say.I'm gonna shut up and let you get a word
in, because usually I'm not like this.Usually I...There I go again! I can't stop talkin'.I'm on a jag, for Pete's sakes!
You'd think I was loaded.Well, anyway, like... like I started to say...Ahi!I can't stop my mouth. Isn't this stupid?You got a real nice face, you know.Really, a nice face.Thank you.- Hey, Mac. Anything good inside?
- A bunch of dogs.Hey, Marty.Marty, you in here?So I'm in a kneeling position,and if you ever tried shootin' a BAR in a
kneeling position, you know what I mean.I can't hold a steady position.
I'm waverin' back and forth.So the guy next to me,
he's shootin' from a prone position,and he's cross-eyed, like I told you.So just then...So just then I hear five shots go off
from the guy next to me.My target goes down. A minute later
the flag comes up. I got five bull's-eyes!That's how I got the reputation of being
the best shot in the whole battalion!So when I got out of the army,
Clara, I was lost.I didn't know what I wanted to do.I was 25 years old.What was I gonna do?
Go back to my old job, 40 cents an hour?I thought maybe I'd go to college
under the GI Bill of Rights.But my brother Freddie wanted to get
married and I had three unmarried sisters.In an Italian house, that's a terrible thing.So I just went to pieces.I used to walk the streets
till three, four o'clock in the mornin'.My poor mother...
used to be so worried about me.God forgive me what
I'm gonna say now, but...I used to think of doin' away with myself.I used to stand on the subway and,
God forgive me what I'm gonna say, I...I used to feel the tracks
suckin' me down under the wheels.Yes, I know.I'm Catholic, you know. Even
to think about suicide is a terrible sin.Yes, I know.So then Mr Otari, he offered me this job
in his butcher shop and...Everybody pleaded with me to take it.So that's what happened.I didn't wanna be a butcher.There's nothing wrong
with being a butcher.Well, it's not an elegant profession.It's in the lower social scale.
People look down on butchers.I don't.Well, the point is Mr Otari
wants to sell his shop now because...It's a nice little shop. I handle his bookswhich is not unreasonable.Takes home net
maybe $100, $150 a week.Point is, of course, you gotta
worry about the supermarkets.There's two in the neighbourhood and an
A&P comin' in, at least that's the rumour.Marty, it's my feeling that
you really want to buy this shop.Well, that's true. I do.But it means I gotta take a loan
out in a bank of $8,000.That's a big note to carry.Marty, I've known you for three hours,
but I know you're a good butcher.You're an intelligent,
decent, sensitive man,and... well, I have a feeling about you.Like, well, like sometimes one of my kids
comes to see me about something,and some of these kids, Marty,
in my classes, they...they have so much warmth
and so much capacity.Well, that's the feeling I have about you.If you were one of my students,
I'd say to you""Go ahead and buy the butcher shop.
You're a good butcher.""Well, there's lots of things
I could do with this shop.I could organise my own supermarket.Get a bunch of neighbourhood
merchants together.That's what a lot of them are doin'.What do you think?I think anything you wanna do
you'll do well.I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?Yes, I am.Look, I only got about $3 on me now, but
I only live about eight blocks from here.Why don't we go back to my house, I'll get
some dough and we can go somewhere?I... I really should get home.It's only a quarter of 12.
The clock's right up there.I... I really should get home.
I told my father...Well, I... I suppose a little while longer...Do you suppose there's someplace
around here I could put on some makeup?Oh. Hey, Mac!
You got a ladies' room around here?- In the back.
- In the back.- She told me, at the risk of her life.
- She always had thin hips.She told me the doctor told her, if she had
more babies, it'd be at the risk of her life.When she told me that,
she already had six!Every time I saw her, she was either
goin' to the hospital or comin' from it.- She was hatchin' 'em out like eggs.
- Her husband's a skinny fella.Well, I bumped into her on the street
and she was as big as a barrel.- I said to her ""Mary...""
- Lou, seen Marty?- No, I ain't seen him all night.
- Where's everybody?""Didn't you say if you
had another it'd kill you?""And her husband's a little bit of a man.Well, last week on Tuesday she gave birth
to her baby in St Elizabeth's Hospital.- A fine, healthy boy. Nine pounds.
- That's fine. So the doctor was wrong.Oh, no. She died
right there in the hospital.Oh, that's a sad story.- And her husband's that little fella?
- That's the one.That's a sad story....moving out to Port Chester.
It's silly to think of commuting.I'd have to take the subway down to
125th, then take the bus to the railroad,and then take the New York, New Haven
and Hartford out to Port Chester.Then I think I have a 20-minute bus ride
out of Port Chester.Somebody suggested that I buy a car,
but I'm terrified of cars.I'm always afraid I'll kill someone.Of course, it is a fine opportunity for me.I could never hope to be the head of a
department in the New York City system,especially not in the science courses.Of course, I'm not sure
I want to be a department head.It's mostly executive
and administrative work.On the other hand...Well, anyway I told you about my fatherand, well, he depends on me a great deal.Well, let me tell ya, Clara.
I think you're kiddin' yourself.I mean, I used to think about
leavin' home, you know.And that's what I used to say:
""My mother needs me.""But when you really come down to it,
that ain't it at all.We're just afraid to go out on our own. It's
a big step when you go out on your own.And I think you're kiddin' yourself
when you say your father needs you.Actually, you need your father.
You know what I mean?Well, you know what I mean.You're livin' at home now and
you've got your father and mother there.You could go on like that,
be a little girl all your life.I'm afraid of being lonely.You won't be so lonely.
You'll make friends right away.Well, actually, I don't make friends easily.What are you talkin' about?
You're a real likeable person.You'll make friends
in Port Chester one-two-three.You'll have people visitin' you
all the time. I'll visit you.I'll get my brother Freddie's car
or you can call me up when you feel blue.Or I'll call you up and...It'll be real nice. Don't be so afraid.Hey, Marty!Hey, Marty! Hey, over here!- Hello, Ralph.
- Hey, Marty. Come over here a minute.- Excuse me a minute.
- Sure.- You'll like this guy. He's nice.
- Who? Marty?- Yeah.
- Oh, this guy's a nice guy, this guy.- Hi, Ralph. Hello, Leo.
- Hiya, Marty.Hey, Marty, come here a minute.Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel.
You interested?What do you mean, Ralph?Hey, Louise, meet Marty Piletti.
Marty, that's Louise Kelly.- Hiya.
- We just gonna sit around here all night?Listen, Marty,
these three squirrels are nurses.Money in the bank, man.All goin' over to Leo's house later
because there's nobody there.These are the girls I told you about.Wanna get in the car?
She's a pretty nice-lookin' doll.- I'm with a girl, Ralph.
- Get rid of her. This is money in the bank.I can't do that, because somebody
already brushed her off once tonight.This is a good deal here, Marty.I can't do it, Ralph. Thanks anyway, huh?- Nice seein' you all.
- Come on, let's get outta here.- Yeah. We might as well get goin'.
- I'll see ya, Leo.- So long, Ralph.
- So long, Marty.Wait a minute. I'll find the light.I guess my mother ain't home yet.My cousin Thomas and Virginia must be
at the movies, so they won't be home yet.- This is the kitchen.
- Yes, I know.Come on in the dining room.Sit down.You want somethin' to eat?
We got chicken.No, thank you.
I don't think I should stay long.Oh, sure.
Well, just take off your coat a minute.I was tellin' you my brother Nicky got
married last Sunday. It was a nice affair.They had a statue of a woman and there
was whisky spoutin' out of her mouth.I never saw anything so grand
in all my life. And what a meal!I'm a butcher, so I know
a pretty good hunk of meat when I see it.This was choice fillet right off
the top of the chuck. $1.80 a pound.If you want a cheaper cut of meat,
why, get rib steak.It's got a lot of waste on it, but it comes
to a buck and a quarter a pound,if it's trimmed.Listen, Clara... Make yourself comfortable.
You look all tense.Oh, I'm fine.You want me to take you home,
I'll take you home.Maybe it would be a good idea.- No, Marty.
- I like you. I been tellin' you all night I do.- Marty...
- All I want is a kiss.- Please. Please.
- No, Marty.All right. All right. I'll take you home!All I wanted was a lousy kiss.Think I'd try somethin' serious with
my mother comin' home any minute?I just didn't feel like it, that's all.Well...I'm old enough to know better.Come New Year's Eve,
everybody starts arrangin' parties.I'm the guy they gotta dig up a date for.I'll just get a pack of cigarettes and take...I'd like to see you again...very much.The reason I didn't let you kiss me
was because I just didn't know how to...handle the situation.You're the kindest man I ever met.The reason I tell you this is
because I want to see you again...very much.I know when you take me home I'm going
to lie on my bed and think about you.I want very much to see you again.What are you doin' tomorrow night?Nothing.I'll call you up tomorrow.Maybe we'll go see a movie.I'd like that very much.The reason I can't be
more definite now is...because my Aunt Catherine's
probably comin' over tomorrow.I may have to help out.I'll wait for your call.I better take you home now.It's gettin' late and the buses
only run about one an hour.All right.I'll just get a pack of cigarettes.What are you doin' New Year's Eve?Nothing.Hello! Hello! Marty?- Hello, Marty. When you come home?
- We just got here ten minutes ago, Ma.Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder.
She's a graduate of New York University.She teaches chemistry
in Benjamin Franklin High School.Sit down. Sit down.You want some chicken?
We got chicken in the icebox.No, thank you, Mrs Piletti.
We were just going. Thank you anyway.Well, sit down just a minute. I just
come in the house. I take off my coat.- Did Thomas give you a ride?
- Sure. Is a sad business.My sister Caterina,
she no get along with her daughter-in-law,so she gonna come live with us.- Oh, she's comin', huh, Ma?
- Sure. Sit down. Sit down.- Marty, tell her sit down.
- Might as well sit down a minute, Clara.- You offer young lady some fruit?
- I offered her, but she don't want nothin'.No, thank you, really, Mrs Piletti.Is a very sad business, I tell you.A woman, 56 years old,
all her life she had her own house.Now she's just an old woman
sleeping on her daughter-in-law couch.It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you.Your children grow up
and then what is left for you to do?What is a mother's life but her children?Is a very sad thing when your son
has no place for you in his house.Well, couldn't she find
some kind of hobby to fill out her time?Hobby. Hobby. What can she do?
She cook and she clean.But you gotta have a house to clean
and you gotta have children to cook for.These are the terrible years for a mother.
The terrible years.You mustn't feel too harshly
against her daughter-in-law.She probably also wants to have a house
to clean and children to cook for.You don't think my sister Caterina
should live in her daughter-in-law house?Well, I don't know them, but, as a rule, a
mother-in-law shouldn't live with a couple.Where you think
a mother-in-law should go?I don't think a mother should depend so
much upon her children for her rewards.Well, that's what they teach you
in... New York University.In real life it no work out like this.You wait till you are a mother.It's silly of me to argue about it.
I... I don't know the people involved.Ma, I better take her home because
the buses only run about one an hour.Sure.Good night. I'm glad to have met you.
I hope I see you again.OK, Ma. I'll be back
in about an hour, an hour and a half.- Sure.
- Good night, Mrs Piletti.Good night.Hey!Hey!Hey, Marty! Hey!Hey, Ange!Marty, where you been?
I been lookin' all over for ya.I looked all over for you,
but I couldn't find you.Well, I was lookin' all over for you.We thought we were gonna go for a walkand then we thought we were gonna
come back, but we got to talkin'.I want you to meet Clara.
Clara, my best friend Angie.- I told you about him.
- Yes. How do you do?Hello.- What we gonna do now?
- I'm taking Clara home. It's close to one.- You want me to ride down with ya?
- What for?- It's early.
- It must be one o'clock.It's Saturday night!
There's still plenty of action around!Listen, by the time I get Clara home
it's gonna be 1.30.By the time I get home it'll be two. I gotta
get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.- OK. I'll see ya.
- Hey, well, where you goin'? Hey, Ange.Hey, I'll see ya tomorrow after mass, huh?You got an elevator in this house?We only live one flight up.OK. So I'll see you tomorrow.OK.Uh, I'll give you a call about 11, 11.30,
as soon as I get out of mass.Well, better make it around 2.30, because
I won't be home from my aunt's till then.Oh, OK.OK. So... I'll see you tomorrow night.OK.- Good night.
- Good night.Taxi! Hey, taxi!Taxi! Hey, taxi!Hey!Hey, Ma. You know what
I think I'm gonna do?I think I'm gonna buy Patsy's shop.You hear what I said, Ma?This is how I figure. We got
33-odd hundred dollars in the bank,so I'm gonna have to take it out
to buy the shop. So what do you think?I don't know.I'm a good butcher.
I think I'll make out pretty good.I wanna ask Thomas about this,
but I got my own ideas.Come on, Marty. It's nine o'clock.Listen, Ma, you mind comin' home alone
from church because I wanna find Angie?- I think he's sore at me for somethin'.
- OK.Ma, what I wanna ask you is, is Thomas
bringing Aunt Catherine here or what,because I wanna see him?I think Thomas is gonna bring Aunt
Caterina over here, but I don't know.Now, please go outside
because I gotta put on my clothes.All right. So what are you
gettin' so sore about?Marty? Please excuse what I say.OK, Ma.- Don't you think I feel lousy about it, too?
- I don't wanna talk any more about it.I don't think I got an hour's sleep
the whole night.Last night was the first time
I ever heard my mother cry.- Tommy, I...
- I don't wanna talk about it.I know what you're gonna say. A man's
gotta stop bein' his mother's baby.She's my mother.
I have some feelin' about her.- Why am I always made to be the louse?
- I don't wanna talk about it!Look, Tommy... Tommy, I love you
and I know you feel lousy right now,but we'll never be happy unless we have
a chance to work out our own lives.We can't keep talkin' in whispers the rest
of our lives. We gotta have some privacy.Ma! Can't you wait five minutes?
I'll drive you over.- I just gotta put on a shirt.
- Go to mass.I got time to go to mass.
I'll go to 11 o'clock mass.Let me drive you over, will you, Ma?Thomas, leave me alone.All right, get dressed because
we're gonna drive my mother over.Why couldn't you get along with her,
make an effort?She's hard to get along with.
All I asked you was to try!- Tommy...
- I don't wanna hear any more about it!Hello, Aunt Theresa.Hello, Tommy. How you feel?Ah, my mother... drives me crazy. I had
to beg her to let me drive her over here.- Oh.
- She's always gotta be the big martyr.Please, go to mass, huh?This one, he wake up this morning
with salt in his nose. Do this! Do that!Please leave me alone, huh?- Hello, Thomas.
- Hiya.Hello, Aunt Catherine.
You gonna go to mass with us?- I was to mass two hours ago.
- Oh, good.Make yourself at home.
The refrigerator's loaded.You go upstairs, take any room
you want, OK?Thomas!- You want a cup of coffee?
- Ah.Oh, hi, Virginia.
Oh, you brought him over, huh?Let me hold him for a minute.Hey, Petey boy. Yeah.
You're sure gettin' fat. You know that?Yeah. You're bigger
than a leg o' lamb now.So, Tom, like I was tellin' you
when you was over here,my boss wants to sell his shop, because
he wants to move out to California.- What are you so sore about?
- Shut up. Will you do me a favour?So, Tommy, he does about
$12-1300 gross. The rent's $102.The problem is the supermarkets.
That's what I wanna ask you.If I get together with other merchants...What about the time she wanted
to make dinner, but you wouldn't let her?- Once a month she can't use the kitchen.
- She could use it any time.- You had to be the boss.
- She wouldn't use my pots and pans.- Pots and pans, my foot!
- You want me to buy new pots and pans?Tommy... Tommy...
Look, just give me a coupla minutes.I told Mr Otari I'd let him know tomorrow.
You and Virginia can fight any time.Listen, I wanna know
about individualised mark-ups.Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli
is the dairyman and the grocer,but he works on a...- Do you know what you're talkin' about?
- No, I don't. That's why I'm askin' you!Why d'you wanna buy a shop?You got a good job, no wife,
no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you.What do you wanna buy a shop for?
Take the baby, will ya?If he wants $5,000 down, you'll have
to carry a mortgage: $60, $70 a month.You're single with no responsibilities.
Stay that way. Take my advice.Why are you yellin'? He's askin' advice.Yeah, Tom, but Patsy's shop
is a specialised trade.- Supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
- Who buys Italian? Think my wife does?She goes to the A&P, gets a lamb chop
wrapped in Cellophane, and that's dinner!- All right.
- I know the problem of the supermarkets,but I was talkin' to this girl last night...Look, Marty, will you see
my mother is nice and comfortable?- Oh, sure. But this girl...
- What girl? What does she know?Marty, take care of my mother, will ya?Hey, Ma, get ready,
cos I'll be down in a minute.- Hey, Caterina.
- Huh?Last night when I come home from
your house, Marty was here with a girl.- Who?
- Marty.Your son Marty?Well, which Marty you think
would be here in this house with a girl?- Were the lights on?
- Oh, sure.This girl is a college graduate.They're the worst. College girls
are one step from the street, I tell you.My son Joseph's wife,
you know, she type on a typewriter.One step from the street.This is the first time
Marty brang home a girl.She look like a nice girl. You know,
I think Marty has a feeling for this girl.You heard him sing?
Sing like that all morning.Well, that's all. You'll see.Today, tomorrow, in a week,
he's gonna say to you""Hey, Ma, I'm tired of running around.
It's no good to be a single man.""Then he's gonna say to you ""Hey, Ma.
Why we need this old house?""""Why don't we sell this old house
and move in a nicer part of town?""""Nice little apartment.""I don't sell this house, I tell you that.This is my husband's house.
I had six children in this house.You'll see.In a couple of months you gonna be
an old lady sleeping on a couch- in your daughter-in-law's house.
- Ah, Caterina!Where you go, rain go!Someday you gonna smile,
we gonna have a big holiday.Hey, Ma. What do you say, Ma?
It's gettin' a little late, huh?Sure.Boy, this place is really comin' to pieces.
Ma, I think we oughta sell this place.The whole joint's goin' to pieces.Plumbing's rusty, everything. Now I'm
gonna have to replaster this whole place.You know what we oughta do, Ma?Get one of those new apartments
they're buildin' on Southern Boulevard.A nicer part of town, you know?- You all set, Ma?
- I'm set.- Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.
- Goodbye.We got a couple of minutes yet.- Hi, Marty.
- Hi.Ma, fix your coat.Hey, Marty, we're gonna sit in the back on
account of the baby. See you afterwards.That was a nice-looking girl
last night, huh?She wasn't a very good-looking girl,
but she look like a nice girl.I said she wasn't
a very good-looking girl, not pretty.I heard you, Ma.She look a little bit old for you.
About 35, 40 years old.She's 29, Ma.She's more than 29 years old.
That's what she tells you.<i>Buongiorno. Che bella giornata.
La messa comincia fra poco.</i>She looked 35, 40 years old.She don't look like Italian girl.- I say, is she Italian girl?
- I don't know. I don't think so, Ma.She don't look like Italian to me.What family she comes from?I don't know.
Something about her I... I don't like.It's funny. The first time you meet the girl,
she comes to your empty house alone.These college girls,
they all one step from the street.What are you talkin' about?
She's a nice girl.She don't look Italian to me.- I don't like her.
- You only met her for two minutes.- Don't bring her home no more.
- What didn't you like about her?I don't know. She don't look like Italian
to me. Plenty nice Italian girls around.Let's not fight about it.Why are you gettin' so worked up?
I only met her last night.Probably not gonna
see her again anyhow.Come on.- Hello, Lou.
- Hiya, Marty.- Hi, Ralph.
- Hiya, Marty.Lou, let me have a Coke, will ya?Marty, I hear you really got stuck
with a dog last night.- Who told you that?
- Angie. Said she was scrawny-looking.She wasn't so bad.- Was Angie here already?
- He was here last night till about two.Oh.Hey, Ralph, how'd you make out
with those nurses last night?Oh, Marty. Man, didn't I tell ya?You know that one that was for you,
the one in the back?We went over to Leo's house, you know?
So she got loaded drunk.You should have seen what she was doin'.Even the people downstairs
started bangin' on the walls.So in the middle of the whole thing
the landlord comes in.These crazy girls
are runnin' around drunk.So we gotta get rid of her
because of the landlord.So Leo's talkin' to the landlord while we're
tryin' to get this crazy girl out the window.This crazy girl,
she even left her shoes up there!So how'd you make out?- I had a nice time.
- Yeah?Uh, she's a nice girl.
Oh, I didn't try anything.I just met her last night, you know.
She's a nice girl. We just talked.Uh... uh... We just talked.Listen, Ralph, if you see Angie, tell him
I went home. I'll see him after lunch, huh?- I wanna talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk right now.So the whole book winds up...
Marty. Hey, Marty.So the whole book winds up, Mike
Hammer - he's in the room with this doll.So he says ""You rat, you're the murderer.""So she begins to con him.
She tells him how she loves him.Then bam!
He shoots her right in the stomach.So she's layin' there, gaspin' for breath,
and she says ""How could you do that?""He says ""It was easy.""Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy,
he could write.I read everything he ever wrote.Come on! We got a whole pot.
We give you a plate of your own.I couldn't eat nothin'.
My mother just fed me.What I like about Mickey Spillane
is he knows how to handle women.In one book he picks up this tomato. She
was hit by a car and throws a pass at him.Then he meets two beautiful twins,
and they throw a pass at him.Then he meets a beautiful society dame,
and she throws a pass at him.That Mickey Spillane,
he could really write.Anybody wanna go down Van Courtland
Park, watch the ball games?It's only a little bit after two o'clock.- Where you goin'?
- To call up that girl from last night.- Thought I'd take her to a movie.
- You kiddin'?Now, listen, Angie,
you were very impolite last night.I introduced you to that girl,
you just walked off.- Why'd you do that?
- It got me mad, that's why.Hey, Jerry, show Marty
that picture, you know.Put it away! My mother's out on the porch.- I wonder where they find those girls.
- They're Hollywood starlets.Put it away. My mother'll walk in.Hey, Marty, let's go down
72nd Street area tonight.I don't feel like goin', Angie.
I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.Boy, you must have
made out good last night.- We just talked.
- Boy, she must be some talker.She must have been about 50 years old.The way I figure, a guy oughta marry
a girl 20 years younger than he is,so that when he's 40
she's still a real pretty doll of 21.That means he'd have to marry the girl
when she was one year old.You're right. I never thought of that!- She wasn't so bad-lookin'.
- She must have kept you in the shadows.You don't wanna hang around with dogs.
It gives you a bad reputation.Let's go down to 72nd Street.I told this dog I'd call her up today,
about 2.30.Brush her!You wanna come with me tonight
or go with that dog?- Why you gettin' so sore?
- Cos I looked all over for you last night!Another book that I read by Mickey
Spillane, I can't remember the name of it,but he finds this red-headed doll
on the streetsand he gives her some dough
because he feels sorry for her.Wait a minute. I think that's the same
book I was tellin' you about before.- You didn't like her at all?
- A nothin'. A real nothin'.You know somethin'.
This Mickey Spillane.Boy, he sure can write.So, what are you
gonna do tonight, Marty?I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out.I may just hang around the house and...Maybe I'll go down and see
what Angie and the boys are doin'.I'll see ya later, Ma.<i>We had...
I don't wanna talk like that fella.</i><i>We had the extreme privilege...</i><i>of having Jackie Gleason
make his TV debut on our show.</i><i>So tonight on our anniversary show...</i><i>I'm doing it, huh?</i><i>Oh, now, leave me alone, will ya?</i><i>You know, he scares the life out of me.</i>- What time is it?
- It's about eight o'clock.You don't feel like goin' to 72nd Street?Itll take an hour and an hour back.
The whole evening's gone.What's playin' on Fordham Road? There's
a good picture in the Loew's Paradise.Feel like workin' up a game of cards?Come on, let's go down to 72nd Street.
We'll wind up with somethin'.I'll never forgive La Guardia for
cuttin' out burlesque outta New York City.There's a burlesque in Union City.
Let's go to Union City.You don't even wanna ride
a half-hour on the subway,now you wanna go
all the way down to Union City.I feel like playin' cards. I saw Richie Rizzo.
That's what he said he felt like doin'.I don't feel like playin' cards.
What do you feel like doin', Angie?I don't know. What do you feel like doin'?I don't know.
George, what are you doin' tonight?""What are you doin' tonight?""
""I don't know. What are you doin'?""The burlesque! Loew's Paradise!Miserable and lonely.
Miserable and lonely and stupid.What am I, crazy or somethin'?
I got somethin' good here.What am I hangin' around
with you guys for?Wait a minute, will you?
What's the matter with you?You don't like her. My mother don't like
her. She's a dog, and I'm a fat, ugly man.Well, all I know is I had a good time last
night. I'm gonna have a good time tonight.If we have enough good times together,
I'm gonna beg that girl to marry me.If we make a party on New Year's,
I got a date for that party.You don't like her, that's too bad!Hey, Ange, when are you
gonna get married?You oughta be ashamed of yourself.You're 33 years old.
All your kid brothers are married.You oughta be ashamed of yourself.Hello?Excuse me, Ange.Hello, Clara?<i>What happened? What happened?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i><i>Hey, Marty, what happened with you?</i><i>Saturday we had a party, a party.</i><i>Frankie and Lou, everybody but you.</i><i>Where was you Thursday?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i><i>Hey, Marty, for our bowling game?</i><i>It seems like a year

or somebody? I said I was clean.- I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?
- No. I said I'm clean.- If I do, you know what happens, don't you?
- Yeah. I said I'm clean.Motherfucker, don't...I'll break your motherfuckin' ass.
Fuck you.Oh, yeah, in where?- Gimme a nickel.

- Everything's everything, baby.Hey, how come there's nothin' out there?
That stuff's all milk.Ain't nothin' around.
Nobody's holding.- I got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn.
- Boca?Yeah. B-O-C-A.- Never heard of him.
- What about his wife, Angie?Doesn't register.- There's been some talk.
- About what?A shipment... coming in this week,
week after.Everybody's gonna get well.- Well, who's bringing it?
- Who knows?Oh, shit.Where do you want it?- Where do you want it?
- Oh, shit.This side.- Beat it.
- Damn.I'm gonna check on this address
in the Bronx...and if they don't know you there,
it's your ass.I thought I told you to stand there.Get that hair done before Saturday.We're going now. Good-bye.Move ass.Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.All that is great, but you belong in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, not out there in Ridgewood.Why don't you detach us then, for Christ's sakes?
Give us a shot at it.At least till we find out
if there's anything here or not.Everybody wants Weinstock, right? Well,
maybe here's the lead we're looking for.We deserve this.You couldn't burn a three-time loser...with this garbage you're bringing in here.The man has done absolutely nothing.The first thing you know, you'll wind up
in an entrapment rap-the both of you.Brooklyn is loaded with guys...that own candy stores, two cars,
and like to go to nightclubs.Yeah, but you put
this little candy store hustler together...with Joel Weinstock,
and maybe we got a big score.Big score, my ass.At best he's selling
nickel and dime bags.I wouldn't be infringing
on your coffee break, Simonson...if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle.Or have you forgotten about that already?Jesus Christ, Jimmy.
What's happened to you guys lately?Every year you lead
the Narcotics Bureau in arrests.What was it,
over a hundred again last year?Terrific. But who?
What did you bring in?- A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch.
- Oh, Christ.You grab a bellhop because
he's got three joints in his sock.Walt, we got the information
there's no shit on the street, right?It's like a goddamn desert
full of junkies out there.- Everybody waiting to get well.
- Goddamn it.This could be it.
This little candy store guy...He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy
nightclub with known narcotics connections.They were all over him.And then, on our own,
after working a whole day and night...we tail him to Brooklyn,
and we sat on him for practically a week.Now, who do we come up with?
Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake.Now, you gotta let us have it.Do you believe all this crap?I go with my partner.- What'll it take?
- A wire.- No. Two wires.
- Two wires.One on the store, one on the house.You know I have to get a court order
for a wiretap, don't you?But you'll try.We know you can do it, Walt.Popeye.You still pickin' your feet
in Poughkeepsie?Mr. Devereaux,
is this your first trip to New York?Yes. It's my first trip.Why did you choose to come by ship?The next several weeks
will be very difficult for me...and the middle of the ocean
is the only place...where the telephone
isn't ringing all the time.Mr. Devereaux, do you agree
with the recent survey finding...that showed that Mayor Lindsay
was the sexiest man in the world?To les femmes.Here's the rest of the warrants. The
court order's in there for the wiretaps.Judge gave you 60 days on it.Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein
will sit in for the feds.They'll make all the buys.Make sure you keep 'em informed
of everything that goes down.You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill?Yeah, I know Popeye.- His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
- Hey, look.If this is the way
you're comin' in on this...why don't you stay home
and save us all a lot of grief?- 'Cause that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.Whatever.Bill, look. Please...
Do me a favor. Give them a chance.He came in here
with a little basic information.I know you worked with him before.
You had a little trouble.- But don't get off on the wrong foot?
- I'm not getting off...- If you have any problems, come to me with 'em.
- Just keep him off my back.- Just try and cool it with him.
- I will.If you have any problems, come to me.
I'll handle him.- Do me a favor.
- I'll be happy to work with him, believe me.He's a good cop-basically a good cop.- He's got good hunches every once in a while.
- Fine, fine, fine.- Give him a chance.
- Keep him off my back.Florida's Mackel Brothers...invite you to join the great escape.You can say good-bye
to air pollution, commuting...high prices, rising taxes
and cold, depressing winters.Mackel Brothers will show you
the way to Florida...and fresh, clean air,
warm and sunny year-round weather...and a home that you'll be proud to own.Call Mackel Brothers right now for...Popeye.Popeye!- What?
- It's me, Cloudy.Open the door.I can't.What do you mean, you can't?
You all right?Yeah, I'm all right.
Let yourself in, will you?What happened?That crazy kid.She locked me up with my own cuffs.Where's the keys?Over there.Hi there.Anybody hurt in this wreck?Thought I told you
to get plastic folders for this stuff.Your scrapbook is like you-
a mess.Gimme my pants, will ya?Come on.- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.I also got two feds-
Mulderig and Klein.What do we need those pricks for?Because our department's got
about 908 bucks to make buys...and they can get all they want
from ""Uncle Sap.""Hello.These yours, darling?Mike, take a look at this blue one
with the tan, on the right.You got an extra grand with you?A lot of this stuff is
worth a grand, total.- I got it. I got it if I need it.
- All right.- Keep it good and ready.

Sold to the gentleman for 25.Every car sold here today...Where are you?Taking care of business.What do you mean, taking care of business?
It's after midnight.You know I had to meet some people tonight.Yeah, well, finish all your
meeting people and get back here now.- And bring a pizza with you.
- Where am I gonna get a pizza this time of night?Well, try, okay?Hey, I don't know where
I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.- Sal?
- Yeah?Don't forget-Anchovies.- Salvatore?
- Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.- Who is it?
- Hello. Hello. Yeah, this is Sal.- How are you?
- Sounds like a foreigner.You meet me Wednesday
at the hotel, okay?- Good. Great.
- Sounds French.- Will I expect you?
- Yeah. What time?- 12:00. Yes?
- Yeah. Yes. Yeah.Strictly small potatoes.Sure can pick 'em, Doyle.Still wearing your gun on your ankle?You know, someone told me
the reason why you do that...is when you meet a chick
and you rub up against her...she can't tell you're a cop.I said, ""That's bullshit.""It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick
or something.""Bill, why don't you knock it off?He's gettin' too far ahead.You're gonna lose him.For Christ's sake, move the car?- Jesus Christ!
- Move it!Move it, will you, mac?Son of a...What the hell is goin' on here?Come on, Cloudy, move.Klein, this is Cloudy.
Do you read me?Bill, for-
Bill, come in, for Christ's sakes.This is Cloudy. Do you read me?Listen. We lost him on the bridge.Right. I got him.
He's heading north on East River Drive.Excuse me. Excuse me.You take Sal. I'll take the beard.There goes Sal.Do you want the red or the white?What year?- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, the guy who just walked in...What's his name?Here.I'm pretty sure that was the frog.He made me too.He lives on four. He went up to six.He's cute. Real cute.The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.- Who's on him?
- Klein.- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
You look like shit.- Come on.
- Look. My partner and I made this case.You know? Originally.
We don't want any feds screwin' it up.Case? So far you haven't
showed me a damn thing.You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna
knock you right in the middle of next week.- Get out-
- Knock it off.- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it.
- We don't need this.Now, cut it out, will ya?
For Christ's sakes!There's nothing going down.
Get some sleep.Blast off.180.200. Good Housekeeping
Seal of approval.210. U.S. Government certified.220. Lunar trajectory.Junk of the Month Club sirloin steak.230.Grade ""A"" poison.Absolute dynamite.89% pure junk. Best I've ever seen.If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing
on this load for two years.- So you're telling me it's worth a half million?
- How many kilos?- Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?Eight big ones a kilo, right?This stuff'll take
a 7-to-1 hit on the street.And by the time it gets down to nickel
bags, it'll be at least 32 million.Thank you, Howard. Take what's
left there with you, and good night.Not that one. The little one.- I guess we got a deal?
- What we got here, Sal, is a test.A deal for half a million dollars?
Maybe.Maybe?Come on, Joel. I know that guy's
in a hurry. Wants the bread.He wants to go back to France. This guy's
not gonna hang around and play games.Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats
I ever come across.What am I, a schmuck?
What's the hurry?He could see a couple of shows...visit the top of the Empire State Building.Don't jerk me, Weinstock.
I spent a lot of time settin' this one up.So what do you want, a badge?This is your first major league game, Sal.
One thing I learned...Move calmly, move cautiously.
You'll never be sorry.Look. I've been damn careful up to now.This is why your phone lines are tapped and the
feds are crawling all over you like fleas.Look, I'm telling you,
he'll take the deal somewhere else.So let him take his 60 kilos
of heroin someplace else...and find how easy it is
to put together a half a million in cash.He wouldn't find there's any hurry
to do this kind of business.The stuff is here!
We could make the switch in an hour!Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you.
He'll split if we don't move!This guy's got 'em like that.
He's everything they say he is.What about you, Sal?Are you everything they say you are?I'll be a son of a bitch.Come on!Thank you. Hello.This is Doyle.
I'm sittin' on Frog One.Yeah, I know that.
We got the Westbury covered like a tent.The Westbury, my ass!
I got him on the shuttle at Grand Central.Now, what the hell's goin' on up there?I make him coming out of the hotel,
free as a bird. There wasn't a soul awake.What the hell are you talking about?Yeah, well...Listen, I don't care how many bartenders
you got that are sick.Nah, I'm not workin' that joint.
That's right.Same to you, buddy.Can I get a grape drink?Watch the closing doors.You son of a bitch!Hi. Can I have a
round-trip ticket to Washington?- Washington? Cash or charge?
- Cash.- Cash is $54.
- Right.Okay. Please print your name on both
tickets before you board the plane.Yeah. Bye-bye.Bye-bye. Have a nice flight.- Yes, sir?
- Round trip to Washington, please.So?So everything's going great,
terrific, beautiful.I'll need a few more days though.The boys think we oughta
cool it for a while...just to make sure there's no heat.You must take me for an imbecile.Why do you think I asked you
to meet me in Washington?I haven't spent five minutes
in New York City...without the company of a policeman.Look, I'm leveling with you.I need a little more time.It's just that my people think we oughta
find a better time to make the switch.- That's all.
- It has to be by the end of this week.Look, Charnier.
You got to be reasonable.It's your problem.Well, it's your problem too.It's so nice to have seen you again.I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.I can't get any more time.- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?
- You're not gonna get it.We found a set of works on the kid
driving the sports car over there.His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sittin' on Boca.Jimmy, give it up. Give it up.
It's all over with.If there was a deal, it's gone down by now.
We blew it.We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.Walter, listen.
I know the deal hasn't gone down.I- I know it. I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.Last time you were dead certain,
we ended up with a dead cop.Hey! Hold-Hold on! Hold on!Break it up, both of you!
Will you two break it up?Stop it now. Hold on to yourself!
What's the matter with you?- Son of a-
- Jimmy, you wasted two months on this.No collars are comin' in while you two guys
are runnin' around town, jerkin' off.Now, go back to work!
You're off special assignment!10-4.Oh, there he is!Oh! Oh!Get down! Get down. Get out of the area!Leave her alone! Get away!
Leave her alone!There's a sniper up there!Somebody should call the doctor.Hey, there's a doctor
right across the street.- There must be a doctor.
- There is one.Hey!Hey!Stop that man!
He's wanted by the police!- What's the next stop into the city?
- 25th Avenue.Hold it!Police emergency!
I need your car. I need your car.When am I gonna get it back?For Christ's sake!Hold it! Stop! Halt!- Don't stop. Don't stop, or I'll kill you!
- Hey, what? What...I gotta stop in the next station.Touch the brake,
and I'll blow you in half.- What's going on?
- I don't know. Sit down, buddy. Relax.Coke! Coke, you all right?Hey, Coke. You all right?Don't answer.Hey, Coke. You all right?Get back!- Relax. Now, put your gun down.
- Keep going!Oh, my God!You're not gonna get away with this.
Put the gun down.- Get back!
- Come on now...- I said get back!
- You can't get away...Stop!Hold it!Let's get out of here!Come on! Come on! Shake your ass.It's getting cold.I can't seem to find the damn ticket.- Where's the guy?
- He's getting my car from the back.- Thank you.
- Sure.- Can I help you?
- Yeah. It's a convertible.Do you have the ticket?The top one. The top floor?- What kind of ticket do you have?
- Never mind.He's in the brown Lincoln,
foreign plates.- All right. He's walking towards Front Street.
- Got him.Angie's parked over here in the LTD.Cute.You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.That car's dirty, Cloudy.We're gonna sit here all night
if we have to.What time is it?Ten after 4:00.Ten after 4:00.That's the third time
those guys have been around.All right. Let's hit 'em! Hit 'em!Freeze!All right. Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!Get over... Get over there! Hey!
Get up there!Spread those fucking legs!
Now stay right there!You move,
I'll blow your fuckin' head off!- What the hell's that?
- What are you doing? Turn around!- Man, I have my rights.
- What do you mean, your rights?Who's the boss here?
Hey, who's running this outfit?- I am.
- You are?- What are you doing here? Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.Don't talk back to me, man.
What are you doing here?- We saw the car, man.
- You heist this car?No. We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up. Lock 'em up.- All of you, come on.
- Come on! Come on!Come on. Stop draggin' your ass.
Keep your hands on your head.You dumb spics, get outta here!
Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!Nothin' but a bunch
of lousy spic car thieves.- Nothin' in there except a New York City map.
- Are you bullshittin' me?That car's dirty.Take it in and tear it apart.Tear it right out. Tear it out!Nothing here, Jimmy.Look in here.This is all solid.There's nobody been under that car
since it came from the factory.That thing is clean.I don't buy that, Irv.The stuff is in that car.Well, you find it. I can't.Look, the car was lost
some time last night.First, they send us to Pier 1,
then they send us here. Then what?I don't understand why you parked the car
down by the waterfront.You tell me you're staying at the Doral
in midtown Manhattan...and you lose the car
out by the Brooklyn Bridge?Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting
locations for a film for French television.He probably left the car
to look at some point of interest.We were told by the police commissioner's
office that the car was brought to this garage.I demand its immediate return.You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux.
We get 400, 500 cars here a day.Monsieur Devereaux is
a very important guest of this country.He's working with the absolute cooperation
and participation of your government.Here are his credentials
from the French consulate.Unless you wish to see this episode
portrayed in his film...I suggest you locate the car immediately.You're in a no-smoking area, sir.Will you please
extinguish your cigarettes?What was the weight of the car
when you got it, Irv?4,795 pounds.You sure?That's what it was... 4,795 pounds...when it came into the shop.The owner's manual says 4,675.It's 120 pounds overweight.And when it was booked into Marseille,
it was 4,795.That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.Listen, I ripped everything out of there
except the rocker panels.Come on, Irv!
What the hell is that?Well, shit!Son of a bitch.All right.It isn't the only car we have here.Got it for you, Randy.
It just came in from downtown.- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr. Devereaux. Why?Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux...but we get a lot of cars here at night,
and sometimes it's hard to keep track...- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. It's right outside.They stole it right
off the street from you?Goddamn.You're gonna have to pay
the towing charge, you know.I was told these things happen
in New York, but one never expects it.Well, that's New York.
Is this your first trip over here?- Yeah. Where's my car, please?
- It's right over here.But you're lucky this time.It's in perfect shape. Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.Henri.Je vous attendais.- Let's go!
- Bon voyage.Merci.I would give you a ride, but...Tom, take care.Take care, baby.Lou!Yea!- Listen. I'll see you at Pop's tonight?
- Okay, babe. Take care?We made a good strike?What happened with Sal?
What's the matter with him?They got the bridge blocked off!Let me in! Open the door.This is the police!
You're surrounded!Come out with your hands up!This is the police! You're surrounded!Bring out the gas!Hold your fire!Stop!Stop!We're coming out! Hold your fire!Drop the guns!Over here! Move it. Let's go!Popeye?It's me! It's me!Frog One is in that room.Drop it!Mulderig.You shot Mulderig.The son of a bitch is here.
I saw him. I'm gonna get him."

How you doing?Pretty good. Yeah, I'd be a lot
better if I could get, uh......Ralph to stop,
you know, acting.He'll be fine.And he was yelling,
""I love you,
I love you, bitch!""What do you do
with a love like that?That's not love
and you know it.Why do you insist
on calling it love?Say what you want,
but I know what it was.What about you, Nick?
Does that sound like love?Sorry I'm late.
Sound like love...Look, I'm the wrong
person to ask.I only heard the man's
name mentioned in passing.I wouldn't know. You'd have
to know the particulars.I think you're saying
love is absolute.Yeah. The kind of love
I'm talking about is...The kind of love
I'm talking about,you don't try
and kill people.It was love, Mel.
To Eddie, it was.I don't care
what anyone says.He was ready
to die for it.Ask her what he did after
she left him.He shot himself in the mouth,
but he screwed that up, too.Poor Ed.Poor Ed, my ass!
The guy was dangerous!How did he screw up
shooting himself in the mouth?He used to carry this .22.
We lived like fugitives then.Ralph, Ralph, Ralph.Fugitives are scared,
you know?Fugitives are on the run.Can you give me more of that?
You know, fear?Great idea.We lived like
fugitives then.I never knew if he was going to
come out from behind a bush,or a car,
and just start shooting.The man was crazy!
He was capable of anything!Christ,
what a nightmare.He'd call me at
the hospital and say:""Son of a bitch,
your clays are numbered!""Too much?
It's a little bit too much.I can tell, because you...
I just want to
give you a range.Call 911!Is he breathing?Is blood coming
out of his ear?Where are you going?Did someone call 911?Do not move him!
Wait for an ambulance!Well, that's
a fucking lawsuit.Where are you going?
The understudy'll be here.Forget the understudy.
Cancel the first preview.But it's a full house!
We'd have to refund...Just do it.How's Ralph?
He'll be fine.Wait. Will you fucking wait?Jake, it would
have been a disaster.That guy's the worst actor
I've ever seen.Bleeding's the most honest
thing he's done so far.He's not that bad!Okay, he's fucking terrible.You have the press in your
dressing room in a few hours.I'll make something up.
I'll think of something, riff.Hold on.That wasn't an accident.What do you mean?I made it happen.Oh, okay.Are you drunk?Just find me an actor... a good actor.
Woody Harrelson!<i>He's</i> doing
<i>the next Hunger Games.</i>Um, Michael Fassbender.He's doing the prequel
to the X-Men prequel.How about, uh, Jeremy Renner?
Who?Jeremy Renner!
He was nominated.
The Hurt Locker guy.He's an Avenger.Fuck! They put him in a cape, too?
I don't care.Just find me someone.Ralph will sue us. He will
sue us and he has a case.Just make it go away.Look, you're my attorney. You're my
producer. You're my best friend.Now go out there and do
what you were born to do.How do you suppose I do that?
How...<i>Next, an exclusive
interview with Robert Downey, Jr...</i><i>who's busy following up his
billion-dollar</i> Iron Man <i>franchise...</i><i>...with the equally successful
Avengers series.</i><i>That clown doesn't
have half your talent...</i>...and <i>he's making</i> a <i>fortune
in that Tin Man get-up.</i><i>We were
the real thing, Riggan.</i>We had <i>it</i> all.We gave <i>it</i> away.Breathing in.<i>We handed these poseurs
the keys to the kingdom.</i>Breathing out.<i>You listening to me?</i>Breathing in,
I embrace my anger.Yeah, embrace it.<i>But I'm not going away.
You know I'm right.</i><i>Look at that.</i><i>These people don't know
what you're capable of.</i>Why would
somebody go from playingthe lead in
a comic book franchise......to adapting Raymond Carver
for the stage?As you're probably aware,
Barthes said:""The cultural work done in the
past by gods and epic sagas...""...is now being done by laundry
detergent commercials...""...and comic
strip characters.""This is a big leap
you've taken.Yeah, it is.
Absolutely. Absolutely.Like you said......that, uh,
Barthes said, uh...Birdman, like lcarus...Okay, hang on.
Who is this Barthes guy?Which Birdman was he in?Uh, Roland Barthes
was a French philosopher,and if you knew anything
about the history of...Now is it true you've been injecting
yourself with semen from baby pigs?I'm sorry, what? As a method
of facial rejuvenation?Where did you read that?It was tweeted by
@prostatewhispers.That's not true.I know,
but did you do it?No, I didn't do it.Okay, I'll write
you're denying it.Don't write anything.
Why would you write anything?Don't write what she said.
I didn't put any baby pig...Are you at all afraid that
people will say you're doing this play......to battle the impression
you're a washed-up superhero?No, absolutely not.
That's why......twenty years ago,
I said no to Birdman 4.<i>Birdman 4?
You do Birdman 4?!</i>Thank you for coming out.
Thank you.We're expecting
some great pieces.The guys in publicity......want a Times feature,which is the worst
idea right now.What are you doing?I don't want to look
at this anymore.That was a present
from the crew.Don't fuck with them...
they're union.I don't care.How'd it go?
Good.They talk about Ralph?
He did it.The motherfucker did it.Threatened to sue us.What'd you say?
Me?I said, ""Motherfucker,
are you threatening me?""If I so much as get
a letter from a lawyer...""...the press is getting
pictures off your computer.""What pictures?He has a thing
for nuns in diapers.Why do you care? Point
is, I made it go away.That's great.Yeah, it's fantastic,
except for one thing.We have no actor.
Uh-huh.And if we cancel the preview,
the press will smell blood.We can't afford to
lose any more money.What do you think
I should do?We hired an understudy.Use him.
No.Riggan, listen to me. Please,
for the love of God, listen.Our perfect dream actor is not going
to knock on that door and go,""Hey, fellas,
when do I start?""Can I talk to you?
What's up?You find another actor?
No.Mike's available.
Mike who?I thought he was
doing the thing...He quit. Or got fired.Mike who?Which is it, quit or fired?
With Mike, it's usually both.Mike fucking who?
Shiner.Yes!
Jake.How do you know
Mike Shiner?We share a vagina.You think he'd do it?
Mmm-hmm.How do you know?
He told me.Jake.
Yes.Ask me if he sells tickets.Does he sell tickets?A shitload. Ask me if the
theater critics love him.Do theater critics
love him?They want to spooge on him.Right on his face.
Everything for a reason.You think he'd come in
this evening?I'll call and find out.I'll call his agent.Amazing, amazing.Annie? Clear the theater,
send everyone to dinnerand give me some lights!We've got
a put-in tonight.Who?You'll find out.Intimidating, isn't it?You have any idea
the people who havewalked on these boards
before you?Geraldine Page.
Helen Hayes.Jason Robards. Marlon Brando.
And now Riggan Thomson.Thanks for coming
in on such short notice, Mike.This is what I do.You wrote this adaptation?I did, yeah.
Ah.And you're directing and starring.
That's ambitious.Well, thanks.Well, it's a good theater.I can't speak for your play, but...
let's do a little bit of it.Oh, I didn't expect
you to just jump right in.It's first preview tomorrow night.
Let's get to work.Well, feel free to take the script
up until you feel comfortable.No, let's just do some of it.Uh...Take a look at page 20.I'm good. I don't need it.I don't need the script.
Give me a cue.What?Feed me a line.Feed me a line.Okay.Okay, uh, let me think.I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.I only heard his name mentioned
in passing. Mmm-hmm.You'd have to know
the particulars.But I think what you're
saying is love is absolute.- Is that what I'm saying?
- Am I saying love is absolute?Yes. Okay, yeah!
The kind of loveI'm talking about is absolute.The kind of love I'm talking about,
you don't try to kill people!How do you know the lines?It's a thing I have. I don't
know, it's a gift. Wow.Come on. I've been helping
Lesley get off book for a month.These lines are right here.
That makes sense.That's good.
Give me my cue again.I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.You never know the particulars.
I think what...Can I make a suggestion?Do you mind?
No, not at all.No, no, forget that.
Just stay with me.""I'm the wrong person to ask,"" he
says, but what's the intention?Is he fed up
with the subject?Deflecting guilt
over the marriage?And here's the thing... you
have four lines after thatthat all say the same thing.
""I didn't know him.""""I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.""""I wouldn't know.""""You'd have to know
the particulars.""""Particulars"" sounds
like my grandmother.The point is, you don't know the guy.
We fucking get it.Make it work with one line.""I didn't even know
the man."" Right?Wait... You know
my lines, too, huh?Can we not get hung up
on knowing lines?Can we just work on this?
Tear it apart?So why don't you just give
me that same thing again,but cut it down. Try it.
Uh...I'm the wrong person to ask...Oh, no! That's the thing...
""I'm the wrong person to ask.""I think it's, ""Fuck you.""""Fuck you.
Don't put me on the spot.""""Don't make me feel
self-conscious about my marriage""while my wife is sitting...""Right there.
""...right there.""Can I sit down for this?
Yeah, sit. Good idea.So just give it to me as a
""Fuck you."" Lay it on me.Just do it. Give it to me.Well, I'm thinking. Fuck me hard.
Just give it.Come on!
Just do it!Hey, I'm the wrong
person to ask!I don't even know him.
What's your point?!What's my point?
Yeah, what are you saying?Spit it out!
on! on!You're saying what? You're
saying love is absolute.Yes! Yes!The kind of love that I'm
talking about, it is absolute!The kind of
love that I'm talking about,you don't......you don't try
to kill people.Yeah. Good.I don't know...
what do you think, boss?You want to do
this with me?What do you think?Everybody's back. Larry needs
to see him for a fitting.I'll take that as a yes.So, who are you?That's Sam, my daughter. Oh.Wow! That's amazing. You don't
look anything like each other.What do you do?Um... She's my assistant.
Works with me.And does she talk
and speak?She does. Yeah.She can even sit or stay or roll
over, if you have any treats.Welcome aboard, Mike!Thank you, Captain.Um, I'm Mike... Shiner.Oh, I know who you are.I, uh, saw you in Hothouse
at the Geffen.You were great.Oh, thank you.
Your ass is great.Dude. Seriously?That was just me...Larry? Larry?This is the theater,
sweetheart.Don't be so self-conscious.He's here.Thank the Lord
and pass the biscuits.I finally have
an actor to dress.How are you, Larry?Better now you're here.
Take off your clothes.You're just going
to stand there?This is the theater, honey.
Don't be so self-conscious.We have to start from scratch
with less than 24 hours.Here. Try these...Holy shi...!
Where are your underpants?Under the bed
at home, I think.Uh...No. Okay, okay.
Everything's too small.You're not kidding.
Oh.Whoa. That's nice.Forgive him, Larry. Mike's
like my 5-year-old son.Neither of them
has clean underwear.Or pubic hair, I imagine.I can alter the suit,but we're going to have to
make new trousers and shirts.And underwear.What are you doing?
Waiting on Larry.I'm finished!Then I'm just standing here
with my cock out.Well, get dressed.Riggan's daughter
is hanging around...
she might walk in here.You haven't seen her.She's always around,
watching everyone,
like Little Miss Creepy.I don't know if drugs
fried her brain or what......but I don't want
her running to her fathersaying you
showed her your junk.Then we should
ask her to leave.Oh, God. Really?
Mmm-hmm.- Sammy?
- It's Sam.Sam... Lesley.Listen, um, what I said...Oh, don't worry about it.
He's a handful, huh?How do you always manage to
find a new way to humiliate me?Oh, to be fair,
you make it really easy.What was she doing here?She brought me down.
And stayed?Well, she is a little...
something.This is Broadway.
And I'm here, finally.Now, please, do me a favor,
I'm begging you...don't fuck it up!Lesley.Come here.
Come here.Play with my balls.Don't do it. Ow!Just sign it.Listen...
No, you listen to me!I can't afford
to listen to you.I have to go
shopping again.Just sew something,
you old fuck!Give him
whatever he wants!It's four times what
we paid what's-his-name!Go into the reserve.It's gone! We spent it
on fog and fake trees...It's a dream sequence....and dancing midgets!You can't say
""midget"" anymore.The reserve is gone!You didn't see
what I just saw.I'm telling you,
this guy's the real deal.I can feel it.He's the actor
we've been waiting for.Come on. Just get
the contract done.Please, Jake.
I'll get the money.Okay, I'll do it.Stop smiling.
You're freaking me out.Sorry. You're right.Is it true? Shiner?Holy shit.
When can I meet him?He's with Larry now.I'm going to Starbucks.
Want anything?I'm good.She has a great ass.
I have news for you, too.Is it good or bad?
'Cause I really...I missed my last two periods.I think
it's really happening.Wow.Is that good or bad?
Riggan!It's good. It's great.Say something else.
Um...Uh...You sure it's mine?Well, you know,
there's you,there's Jake, the masseur
wore a condom......yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's yours.Idiot.Are you excited?
Yeah.Me, too.You're not funny!What? Hey, what?First preview tomorrow.Here we go.I rode with him in the
ambulance to the hospital.I will never get
that image out of my head.Right before he did it, his
eyes were so sad and lonely.Did you have
to treat him?I didn't have to,
but I did.Music out.
Cue 34, 35 ready.He was
in terrible shape.His head swelled to twice
the size of a normal head.He's good, huh?
He's incredible.I think
he's drinking real gin.What?Ask Nick. I want you to ask
Nick if he thinks that's love.Oh, honey,
can't we just go to dinner?Mel,
don't get him started.You don't know
how he's been lately.He's been depressed.
I've been worried.You've been what?Let me tell you guys something about
real love. I'll tell you something.We all should be ashamedwhen we talk like we know
what we're talking about......when we talk about love.Oh, for God's sake,
are you getting drunk?I don't have to be drunk
to say what I think.We're not drunk. We're having
a few drinks. Exactly.You've had more than a few.What, are you counting?Leave her alone. If you're not
drunk, don't talk like you are.Shut up!Do me a favor.
For once in your life,honest to God,
shut up for a minute.Anyway, like I was saying......you want to know about real
love, there's this old couple......had a car wreck,
out on the interstate.Some drunk kid plowed
his old man's pickup......right into their camper.By the time I got down
to the hospital, this kid,this fucking teenager,
was dead.So we took the old couple
up to the O.R.We worked like hell on them
through most of the night.By the time we were done with
them, we just, you know......wrapped them
in full body casts.The husband,
the old man......was depressed
for the longest time.Even after I said to him,""Your wife's going to pull
through"", he was still depressed.So, I went up to the mouth
hole and I asked him.And he told me it was because
he couldn't see her......through the eyes.
Couldn't see his wife.Can you imagine?I'm telling you, this guy's
heart was breaking because...Ugh......he couldn't turn
his goddamn headand just look at
his goddamn wife.Shit.I mean,
it was killing this guy.I am so tired of this.
Is this water?It was killing him.Did you replace
my gin with water, man?Oh!Mike, come on.""Come on,"" what?
You're drunk.Yes, I'm drunk. I'm supposed to be drunk!
Why aren't you drunk?This is Carver!He left a piece of his liver on the
table each time he wrote a page!If I need to be drinking gin, who
the fuck are you to touch my gin?You fucked with the period,you fucked with the plot
so you'd get the best lines.Leave me the fucking tools that I need!Oh, come on, people,
don't be so pathetic.Stop viewing the world through
your cell phone screen!Have a real experience!Does anybody give a shit about
the truth other than me?This set is fake,
the bananas are fake.There's nothing in
this milk carton!Your performance is fake.The only thing that's real on
this stage is this chicken.So I'm going to work
with the chicken.That was interesting.Bring the curtain down.That's good bird, man!Get him out of here!How do you
want me to do that?Hey, wait.I want him gone.
No!We cannot do that!Of course we can!
It's our show!Listen to me.
No, you listen to me.Get him the fuck
out of my play.It was a preview!
Nobody gives a shit!Nothing matters until
that old bat fromthe New York Times
comes opening night!We're getting rid of him.Shut up! Shut up and
listen to me for once!As soon as we announced he was
taking over, the advance doubled.We can't afford to
lose any more moneyand we can't
afford to lose Mike.This is about being respected
and validated, remember?That's what you told me!That's how you got
me into this shit!Now, you're the director.
Get him under control.Fuck.This isn't the '90s anymore.Your zipper's down.Fuck.You were
really good, cabrÃ³n.Mmm-hmm.Out in front of the theater
in ten minutes!Don't overthink it.What the hell
was going on up there?I didn't know you
were here tonight.That guy's an asshole, huh?What are you doing here?Sam and I are going to grab a
bite after she's finished.No, I mean here. Now.Well, I know how much
this means to you.Oh.Thanks. I appreciate that.So what's happening?With the play?
You saw what.No. You and Sam.Oh, you know, it's great.It's the same.Do you talk to her?Yeah, we talk.It's just been so crazy
around here, you know?You understand
where her head is at.Of course.She's trying to stay away
from everything and everyonethat got her into rehab
in the first place.I know. I really do.
I get it.That's all she's had,
so she's confused.Yeah, I get it.I know you're caught up
in all this stuff, but...""Stuff""?
Uh...You know what I mean.Riggan, you don't have to be
a great father right now.You just have to be one.Oh, sorry.How's that going?I'd rather not talk about it.You're drinking?Yeah, I'm having a beer.So......what's going on with you?Me? Oh...Nothing.Everything's the same,
I guess.I'm going back
to teaching.Oh, yeah?I'm thinking of refinancing
the Malibu house.What? I'm sorry.I'm thinking of refinancing...No, I heard you.
I just need a second.That's going to
be Sam's house.Why Would you...?
For this play?I need the money.Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?What do you want me to say? My
health lasted longer than the money.Go figure that out.What's going on?Riggan, look at me.Uh...I got a chance to
do something right.I got to take it.
I got to.It's funny. I was sitting
here, waiting for you......and all of a sudden, I couldn't
remember why we broke up.You know, the last time
I flew here from L.A......George Clooney was sitting
two seats in front of me......with a nice pair of cufflinks
and that fucking chin.We ended up flying through
this really, really horrible storm.I mean, the plane was
rattling and shaking.And all the people
on board are, you know, crying.I mean, crying.
Praying, right?I just sat there.They're crying,
I sit there.And I'm thinking,
""Oh, boy...""...the next morning, when
Sam looks at the paper...""...it's going to be Clooney's
face on the front page, not mine.""You know? Boom.Did you know
Farrah Fawcett diedthe exact same day
as Michael Jackson?Is that crazy?Why did we break up?Because you threw
a kitchen knife at me......and an hour later, were telling
me how much you loved me.Just because I didn't like that ridiculous
comedy you did with Goldie Hawn......did not mean
I did not love you.That's what you always do...you confuse love
for admiration.It's your house...
do what you want with it.Just be there
for our daughter.I will.You're not Farrah Fawcett,
Riggan.<i>We should have done that
reality show... The Thomsons.</i>Shut up.<i>That would've been good.
Shut up!</i><i>Crazy, druggy, wise-ass daughter,
MILF-y wife with perky tits.</i><i>People would've
wanted to see that.</i><i>Shut up.
More than this piece of shit.</i>Shut up!The sun bed is here.What does that mean?It means there's a sun bed out
there being delivered to in here.Who ordered a sun bed?Mike. He said it's
for his character...part of his process
and that shit.He said he has
to be a redneck.Son of a bitch.Let's go. Walk.Where are we going?
To get you coffee.Did I do something to disrespect you?
Not yet.I have a lot riding on this play.
Oh, is that right?Yeah. People know
who I am, and...Bullshit. They don't
know you, your work.They know the guy
from the bird suitwho tells coy, slightly
vomitous stories on Letterman.Well, I'm sorry
if I'm popular.Popular?
I don't give a shit.Popularity is the slutty little
cousin of prestige, my friend.Okay, I don't even know what
the fuck that means. Mmm.It means, my reputation is riding
on this, and that's worth a, a...A lot. A lot, exactly!
Fuck you. Yes!If this doesn't
work out for you,you fuck off back to
your studio pals......and dive back into that cultural
genocide you guys perpetrate.A douchebag's
born every minute!That was P.T. Barnum's premise
when he invented the circus......and nothing has changed. You guys
know if you crank out toxic crap......people will line up
and pay to see it!But long after you're gone,
I'll be on that stage......earning my living,
baring my soul,wrestling with complex emotions,
'cause that's what we do.Oh, so that's what
tonight was about?You wrestling
with complex emotion?Tonight was about seeing if it's
even alive, if it can bleed.This isn't a backlot, Riggan, this is New
York City. This is how we do things.Where are you going?They have coffee here.Thanks, Tommy.They were laughing at us.Tonight they were laughing,
tomorrow they'll be tweeting.Who cares?These are people
who pay half priceto watch us rehearse.
Stop caring.This play's a drama.
It's about...You don't know what the play's about.
I do know.No, you don't. That's
what previews are for.That's why they
call them previews.That's where you figure out
what the play is.Okay, look, look.
Listen to me.You see the woman at
the end of the bar?The one who looks like she
licked a homeless man's ass?Yeah.All that matters is what she writes
about us in 500 words in the Times.That's, uh...
Tabitha Dickinson, yes.The only opinion that matters
in New York theater is hers.If she likes us, we run.
If she doesn't, we're fucked.She does look like she
licked a homeless guy's ass.Do me a favor.Don't get your panties in a twist
over a preview, like some rookie......and don't tell me
how to do my job.This is my town
and to be honest,people don't give
a shit about you here.- You're Riggan Thomson, right?
- Sorry to interrupt.Would you mind having a
picture with us here?Would you mind?The button's on the bottom.Who is this guy?
He used to be Birdman.Oh, you're such a doll. Thank you.
You're so sweet.Handsome.
Oh.Okay, sweetheart,
come on.Are we good here?I'm going to go home.All right.
See you tomorrow.Oh...I want to know something.Why Raymond Carver?I was a kid,
in high school......doing a play in Syracuse,
and he was in the audience.And he
sent this back afterwards.A little note.""Thank you for an honest performance.
Ray Carver.""That's when I knew
I was going to be an actor.Right there.Oh.What's so funny?It's just on
a cocktail napkin.So?He was
fucking drunk, man.You headed
to Hollywood, Mike?No.Hollywood's
heading here, Tabby.Good luck with that.""A man becomes a critic""when he cannot
be an artist...""...the same way a man becomes an
informer when he cannot be a soldier.""That's Flaubert, right?He's a Hollywood clown
in a Lycra bird suit.Yes, he is.But tomorrow night
at 8:00......he's going out on that
stage and risking everything.What will you be doing?Don't you ever worry that
I'll give you a bad review?I'm sure you will......if I ever give you
a bad performance.Miss Dickinson.Mr. Shiner.What are you
still doing here?Nothing.Um, your costumes are hanging
in your dressing room.Oh, great. Great.Oh, I got that coconut water
you wanted.If you want the face stuff,
it's not open till tomorrow.What?Uh...I'm not sure that
I said thank you.For what?Everything. You've been doing
a really good job, honestly.I've been so preoccupied
with all the...Okay, well,
I just wanted to say that.What is that?That smell.What is it?
Look at me. Look at me!<i>What?
What?</i>You've got to be shitting me.
Where is it?Can we not
do this, please?Dad?Where is it?
I can't believe this.Ugh.What is this?Chunky peanut butter.This. This. What is that? Ah.That's pot. Relax.""Relax."" You can't do this to me.
To you?You know what
I'm talking about.Oh, yeah, you!
What else is new?Don't do that thing where you...
Make it about me? Never!I'm trying to do
something important!This is not important!It's important to me!Maybe not to you
or your cynical friendswhose only ambition
is to ""go viral""......but to me...
God, this is my career!It's my chance to finally do
work that means something.That means
something to who?You had a career, Dad, before
the third comic book movie.Before people started to forget
who was inside that bird costume.You are doing a play based on a
book written 60 years ago......for a thousand
rich old white people......whose only concern is where to
have cake and coffee afterwards!Nobody gives
a shit but you!And, let's face it, Dad......you are not doing this
for the sake of art,you're doing it to
feel relevant again.Well, guess what? There's
an entire world of peoplewho fight to be relevant
every single day!And you act like
it doesn't exist.Things that are happening
in a place you ignore......that has already
forgotten about you!I mean,
who the fuck are you?!You hate bloggers,
you mock Twitter.You don't even
have a Facebook page!It's you who doesn't exist!You're doing this
because you're terrified,like the rest of us,
that you don't matter.And you know what?
You're right! You don't!It's not important, okay?
You're not important...
get used to it!Dad.In the clays before Nick's
depression started to eat away at him......he never knew
I was pregnant,and I never
intended to tell him.I guess we make
choices in life,and we choose to
live with them.Or not.I didn't want that baby.Not because
I didn't love Nick,and not because I didn't
love the idea of it......but just because I wasn't
ready to love myself.There's a distance
to it all now.A wistful distance, underscored
by a gentle breeze...Actors in position....and the sound
of birds...Music out....laughing at
the whimsy of it all.Lesley?
What?I think I'm hard.No, it's just sometimes you don't
consider other people's feelings.No, no. I'm getting
hard... feel that.What?!
You've got to be kidding.Let's really do it.
Let's fuck.No, are you crazy?!It'll be incredible!
It'll be real.Cut it out!
I'm serious, Mike.Don't call me Mike.
Call me Mel.Get off!Terri! Terri!Terri, I know
you're in there!Get off me! Get off!- Ed?
- Why?What are you doing here?
Just tell me why.Take it easy, okay? I know this is hard.Shut up! Shut...Shut up! Just don't
do anything stupid.Eddie, please!What's the matter with me? Why do I
always have to beg people to love me?Eddie, please,
give me the gun.Look at me.I was drowning.
I'm just not capable of...You deserve to be loved,
Eddie. You do.I just wanted to
be what you wanted.Now I spend every
fucking minute prayingto be somebody else.
Somebody I'm not!Anybody-Just put the gun down, Ed.
She doesn't love you anymore.You don't, do you?No.And you never will.I'm sorry.I don't exist.I'm not even here.None of this even matters.
I don't exist. I don't exist.Ed...
I don't exist.Ed! Eddie, Eddie, don't do that!You're such an asshole!What?
That's the best you've been.Why would you do that?!
We were onstage!What the fuck?! It's like
my head was a jar of Bolognese!I'll fix the blood rig....They're fucking
in a motel room.You can't get it up
in six monthsand now you want to fuck me
in front of 800 strangers?!I need it to feel real, okay?
I need that intensity.Oh, fuck you!
Oh.I was in the moment.
I thought you were, too.I'm sorry.I told you to stop,
you fucking animal.You were brilliant.What is wrong with you?!I want your shit
out of the apartment.What? Hey, no, wait.
Look, look, I'm sorry.
Can we just...No, we can't, Mike!
Maybe up here,
you're Mr. Truth......but in the real world,
where it counts,
you're a fucking fraud!How's that for truth,
you dick?!What's wrong?
He's an asshole.What'd he do now?Oh, nothing, just try to fuck
me in front of the audience!Oh, my God!
Right?That's kind of hot!Why don't I have
any self-respect?!You're an actress, honey.I'm pathetic!Look at me.You know, I've always dreamed
of being a Broadway actress......since I was a little kid.
And now I'm here, and I'm......I'm not
a Broadway actress,I'm still
just a little kid.And I keep waiting for someone
to tell me I made it.You made it.I did?Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner on a
fake motel bed in front of 800 people.Shut up.
Oh.Hey, is she okay?She'll be fine.Look, none of this
is your fault, okay?You're beautiful
and you're talented......and I'm lucky
to have you.Okay?Okay.That was kind of sweet.Yeah.What's wrong?Nothing. Two years, and he's never
said anything like that to me.You're beautiful
and you're talented......and I'm lucky
to have you. Okay?We're gross.We are.What are you doing?
Nothing.Do it again.Can we discuss this
like two mature artists?What is the big deal about...Fuck you!You're not ready yet.
That's fine.<i>Hmm.</i>Fuck. Actresses.They drive me
fucking crazy.Riggan?Your gun is ridiculous. I can see
the red plug in the barrel......so you look like a kid with a
plastic toy when you point it at me.I don't feel
threatened at all.Get a better one.
Have some self-respect.Please.Hey, apart from that, uh......I thought it was
a pretty fun crowd, huh?I don't think
it's high enough.Me, neither.What are you
doing up here?Uh, adrenaline.I just got out of rehab.
It's the closest thing
I get to a drug.You went to rehab?Cool.It wasn't all
Dr. Drew or anything,but that dude from
American <i>Pie</i> was there.Jump!Eat me!Okay, then jump on my face!I love this city.Yeah?Why do you act like
a click all the time?Do you just do it
to antagonize people?Maybe.You really don't give a shit
if people like you or not.Not really.That's cool.Is it? I don't know.What?Let's play a game.A game? What are you, eight?
Mmm-hmm.What are you, 78?Truth or dare.
Oh, come on.Truth or dare?
Oh.Truth.When we first met, you made
a comment about my ass.Why did you do that?You have a terrific ass,
and I noticed that.And I just commented on it.Truth or dare?
Dare.Really?
Yeah.There's a bald guy and he's
going to walk right under you.Spit on his head.No.
You said dare.Truth.
No, it's too late.Happy?
Yeah.Ew!Truth or dare?Truth.
You're boring.The truth is
always interesting.Uh...You want to fool
around with me?No.Really?Why not?That's a second question.
It's a second part.I'd be afraid
I couldn't get it up.That didn't seem to be a
problem for you onstage.Nothing is a problem
for me onstage.I want to ask
another question.You already did.One more.
Go ahead.If you weren't afraid, what
would you want to do to me?I'd pull your eyes
out of your head...That's sweet....and put them
in my own skull......and look around,
so I could see the streetthe way I used to
when I was your age.Good night.Don't kill
the messenger.He's an asshole.<i>I told you.</i>You fucking prick.<i>He's playing you-</i>This is it?Page 12. Page 12.""Riggan Thomson, best known

There is no rest of it.Don't worry... it'll be used to

About what?About being
humiliated out there!It won't be the first
time I've been humiliated.Well, of course it won't.You're an asshole.And by the way,
I'm not pregnant,so there's one thing
not to worry about.<i>Forget about her.</i><i>He stole your front page.</i><i>He's stealing your show.

is going on?Get up!
Ow! That hurts!Get up!
Back away!So Carver's the reason
you became an actor, huh?Listen, this is
my fucking show.I did the work, I raised the
money and I arrange the press!Oh, Jesus. They called
me for an interview.I told them the first thing
that came into my head.We got the cover
of the Arts section!Fuck the Arts section!You told them the first thing
that came into your head?Right.You're Mr. Natural.
Mr. Fuck-the-scene-just-stare-
at-my-massive-hard-on.That's truth.You think
it looked massive?Shut the fuck up.You don't get hard on my
stage unless I tell you to.Your stage? Oh, let me
tell you something.This stage has belonged
to a lot of great actors,
but you are not one of them.So you wrote
your own lines, huh?
Ow!I did, actually.You wrote a few
changes and mumbled,
you self-absorbed prick.I'm self-absorbed'?
Look at you.You nobody piece of shit!Nobody? My massive hard-on
got 50,000 views on YouTube.A cat playing with a dildo
gets more than that.I don't care.
Yes, you do! You care.I'm a theater actor. I don't
give a shit. You care.Everybody says,
""Oh, Mike is so honest.""Mike is so motherfucking
truthful!""
Ow!You said in the interview your
father was a drunk like Carver.Is that true?No. No.
'Cause my father was.My father was a mean fucking drunk.
You understand?He beat the shit out of us.But at least when
he was beating us......he wasn't thinking about
taking us out to his toolshed.Because when
he got us out there......that bastard
would smile and say:""You want to get on your
knees and unbuckle my belt,""or do I take it off
and use it on you?""After a while, I made myself numb, so...
But my...My little sister...- Okay. Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.Oh, God.Uh, I didn't know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.That's fucking horrible, man.
I'm sorry.It's also not true. See,
I can pretend, too. Oh!Don't fuck with me, Mike.You're a little bit crazy. You
should start using that onstage.""Working with

Shut the fuck up!Leave me alone!!You're fucking, so fucking annoying!
Shut up!!Hey. What's up?Um, well......one hour till curtain.
Why don't you rest a bit?Yeah, I'm going to lay down.Almost there, buddy. Last preview.
Okay. Cool.How you doing?
Good. Great.The money came through. I just need
to transfer it into the account.Good. That's terrific.So... I'll go, uh, do that.Thanks for stopping by.You know I'm proud
of you, don't you?This took balls.And you did it, okay?
I know.I think we should
cancel the preview.I'm tired, dude. I can't
do this anymore, Jake.I can't.That's a joke, right?You know, I don't think this is for me.
The whole...They're laughing at me.There is a three-block line
of people waiting for you.It's a full house.
We're sold out!Really?
Yes!And the French
ambassador's coming.The Prince of Saudi Arabia's
bringing one of his wives.And I didn't want to tell you
this, but Martin Scorsees......is casting his new film, and...
Don't tell anybody.No, I won't.
Okay?Okay?Okay. Yeah, yeah,
I can be ready.
I can be ready.Good.
Thank you.How is he?He'll be fine.Poor creature.Is it true? Scorsese?Yeah.
And the new Pope, too.You're an asshole, Jake!I'm the one
keeping this afloat!Are you okay?Yeah. Yeah.I think I cut
my hand shaving.Well, I just
wanted to say... I'm sorry.What for?I knew what
Mike was capable ofand I brought him
in anyway.No, no, no.
You did good.Are you kidding?
You did great.Tomorrow's my first opening
night on Broadway.Mine, too.And I just want to let you know
that, no matter what happens......I'm really
grateful to you.Oh, no, no, no.
Me, too.This is exciting.We have a full house.
Jake just told me.Yeah, it's great.Oh, God.For fuck's sake,
just jump already.How'd you know
I'd be up here?Well, I didn't know,
but I kind of hoped maybe.Where is Lesley?Lesley?
Uh, Lesley's moving on.Smart girl.Oh, thank you. I appreciate that support.You ready for
your last preview?Sure, yeah.Who did that to you?Could have been
anybody, I guess.Yes.I'm sort of hoping
it was Lesley.It wasn't Lesley.Oh, my God.Are you fucking kidding me? No.Jesus Christ!I think maybe
I deserved it.Fuck.Fuck.Tell me something.What is the worst thing
that he did to you?Seriously.He was never around.Yeah? I mean, so what?
That was it?No. It was how he tried
to make up for it......by constantly trying to
convince me that I was special.Okay. Look.Look at me.He was right, though.About what?About your being special.You've been hanging
around here......trying to make
yourself invisiblebehind this fragile
little fuck-up routine......but you can't.You're anything but invisible.
You're big.You're kind of
a great mess.It's like a candle burning at
both ends, but it's beautiful.No amount of booze or weed or
attitude is going to hide that.I'm glad you're an actor and not a
writer, 'cause that was, like......Oprah......Hallmark......R. Kelly bad.Yeah, well, I wasn't...Mmm...Truth or dare?Truth.
No.Truth.
No.Truth or dare?Do you have any idea
where you're going?Absolutely not.How do you do it?Do what?Go out there
every single nightand pretend to be somebody else
in front of all those people?I don't pretend out there.
I told you.I pretend just about every
place else, but not out there.That's a shame.What are we doing here?What do you mean?I mean, what are
we doing here?By the time we got to
the hospital, the kid was dead.So we took the old couple
up to the O.R.We worked like
hell on them......through most of the night.The husband, the old man, was
depressed for the longest time.Even after I told him
the wife would pull through,
he was still depressed.So I went up to the mouth
hole and I asked him.And he told me it was because
he couldn't see her......the wife,
through the eye holes.Can you imagine?I'm telling you, this guy's
heart was breaking......because he couldn't turn his
goddamn head to see his goddamn wife.So......I guess the question
we should ask ourselves is......what do we talk about
when we talk about love?Mel and I had been
together five years......and I don't know how many
times I've heard ""I love you,""but it wasn't
until that night...The blood rig
should be good now.Be ready to go
in two minutes.That was amazing!Yeah, good, right?It's actually going well.Yeah.I think we need to talk.No, no.Yeah, I guess
you're right......but we will eventually,
because that's the only wayI'll get a chance
to say I'm sorry.I really am sorry.We'd have made great parents.Horrible.
We'd have been......awful.
We'd have raised......a serial killer. Or Justin Bieber.I really wanted
to be a mom.But my body doesn't
seem to agree.When I imagined
myself on Broadway,I never saw
the dancing reindeer.Nice touch.In the clays before Nick's
depression started to eat away at him......he had no idea
I was pregnant......and I never intended
to tell him.I guess we make
choices in life,and we choose
to live with them.Or not.I didn't want that baby.Not because I didn't love
Nick, and not becauseI didn't love the idea
of it, but because......I just wasn't ready
to love myself.There's a distance
to it all now.Hey, Jimmy,
you got a smoke?Jimmy! Jimmy!Jimmy!!Shit!Fuck!Fuck.Hey, aren't you
Riggan Thomson?Holy shit,
let me get an autograph.Don't be a click.
Give me an autograph.Dude, you rock!Birdman!Oh, shit!Oh, my God!
You know who that is?Oh,
can we take one picture!Just one picture!
Kids, get next to him!You suck!You suuuuck!!Hey, Birdman!Riggan, I'm missing him.It's the Bird-fucking-man!
Hey, come look at this guy!Birdman! Hey, Birdman,
whooo, look at that!Where you going, man?You look so old
in person.Fuck you!Sir! Sir!
Where are you going?Sir! Where are you...? Sir!What are you doing?Waiting for Jake. This is
my attorney, Mr. Roth.We're pursuing financial
remunerations for the injuries...I got a play to do!Sir, you can't go in there!Actors Equity is
a very strong union, sir!Knock, knock, knock!
Terri! Terri!<i>Ed?</i>What are you doing here?Why?! I just need
you to tell me why?Take it easy, Ed.
I know this is hard.Shut up! Fuck you!
Shut up!Shut up!Eddie, please!What's wrong with me?!Why do I always... beg
people to love me?Eddie, please,
just... just give me the gun.I just wanted to
be what you wanted.Now I spend
every fucking clay......trying to be
somebody I'm not!Put the gun down. She doesn't love you!Eddie.Look at me.
I was drowning.I'm just not capable of that
kind of...You deserve to be loved,
Eddie. You do.I just wanted
to be what you wanted.Mr. Roth?
Okay, don't leave, please.Is that a threat?
What wheelchair?Okay, Mr. Roth, please hear me out.
Will you?Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.Give me 10 minutes
to grab my things,give me 10 minutes and
we can... Don't hang up.Goddamn it!
The motherfucker hung up!Dad.Dad!Are you... okay?Why?You seem sort of...No, I'm good, I'm good.This is good. You want some?No.Do you really think you'll be
ready for opening tomorrow?Yeah. Yep.Yeah, well, I mean......previews were
pretty much a train wreck.We can't seem to get
through a performance......without a raging fire or a
raging hard-on. I'm broke.I'm not sleeping,
like, you know... at all.And, uh, this play is kind
of starting to feel like......a miniature, deformed version
of myself that just keeps......following me
around and, like......hitting me in the balls with,
like, a tiny little hammer.I'm sorry,
what was the question?Never mind.Tonight wasn't bad.I know.It was weird,
but it was kind of cool.Yeah, really?Yeah, I think
people liked it.What are you doing?
Homework?No, I don't...No, um...
When I was in rehab,
they made us do this.Really? What is it'?Um... These dashes represent
the six billion yearsthat the Earth
has been around.So, each dash represents
a thousand years.And, um, this... is how long
humans have been here.150,000 years.I think they're
trying to remind us thatthat's all our ego and
self-obsession are worth.I was a shitty father,
wasn't I?No, you were...You were fine.That's right,
I was... l was just fine.I can't...Dad?Oh, shoot. I'm sorry.You just wiped out the
entire human race.There it goes. I'm sorry.Um...You're becoming
a trending topic.Really?I should probably tell you about
this before anybody else does.350,000 views in
less than an hour.Fuck.Believe or not,
this is power.<i>Hey, look,
it's Riggan Thomson!</i><i>Look at that!</i><i>One million, three hundred
thousand hits in the last 2 hours.</i><i>That's Birdman

- Ouch!<i>What do you have
to do to get</i> a <i>job these days?</i><i>Why must actors
have to resort to this?</i>That's going over
to Ms. Dickinson.Give me a minute.Hey, um, that's on me.
She's a friend of mine.Okay. No problem.Thank you.That was......twenty years before I put
on that goddamn outfit.I don't care.Okay. I was just...You know, before
you come tomorrow night.It doesn't matter.I'm going to
destroy your play.But you didn't even see it.Um, you know, did I do
something to offend you?Actually, you did.You occupied
a theater whichmight have been used on
something worthwhile.Okay. But you don't even know
if it's any good or not.That's true. I haven't read a word
of it, or even seen a preview......but after
the opening tomorrow,I'm going to turn in the worst
review anybody has ever read.And I'm going to
close your play.Would you like to know why?Because I hate you,
and everyone you represent.Entitled, selfish,
spoiled children.Blissfully untrained,
unversed and unprepared......to even attempt real art.Handing each other awards
for cartoons and pornography.Measuring your
worth in weekends?Well, this is the theater.You don't get to
come here and pretendyou can write,
direct and act......in your own
propaganda piecewithout coming
through me first.Ah.
So break a leg.Wow. So what has to
happen in a person's lifefor them to become
a critic, anyway?What are you writing,
a review?Huh? Is it any good?Is it bad?
Did you even see it?
Let me read it.I will call the police.No, you won't. Let's read
your fucking review.""Callow."" Callow is a label.""Lackluster.""
That's just a label.""Marginalia""? Are you kidding me?It sounds like you need
penicillin to clear that up.That's a label, too. These are all labels.
You just label everything.That's so fucking lazy.
You're a lazy fucker.You're a lazy...Do you know what this is?
Do you even know what it is?You don't. You know why?Because you can't
see this thingif you don't know
how to label it.You mistake those noises in
your head for true knowledge.Are you finished?
No.There's nothing in here about
technique, about structure......about intention. It's just
a bunch of crappy opinions......backed up by even
crappier comparisons.You write a couple paragraphs,
and you know what?None of this costs
you fucking anything.You risk nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing!Well, I'm a fucking actor.This play cost me everything.So I'll tell you what.
You take this fucking......malicious, cowardly......shittily written review and you
shove it right the fuck up......your wrinkly... tight ass.You're no actor,
you're a celebrity.Let's be clear on that.I'm going to
kill your play.Tomorrow......and tomorrow......and tomorrow,Creeps in this......petty pace......from day to day......to the last... syllable......of recorded time;And......all of our yesterdays......have lighted......fools...A pint of whiskey,

Was that too much?I was just trying
to give you a range.It's a little bit too much.
I can tell, because you...I just want to
give you a range.That was a little too much.
It was a little too much.<i>God, you look

while, looking out at the ocean.Riggan.And I walked......straight into the water.And then I tried
to drown myself.I was up to my chest
when I felt the first one.On my back,
it was like somebody washolding a frying pan to
me and really burning.And then they were on my
chest and all over my legs.The water was full
of jellyfish.They were all over me.I had to fight my way
out of the water
and went up to the beach.I was rolling around
like a maniac in the sand......crying.You said it was a sunburn.I know.
And you believed me.To be honest,
I didn't give a shit.I love you.And I love Sam.I know.I really wish I hadn't
videotaped her birth.Why?'Cause......I missed
the moment, really.I don't have it.I should have just been
there with the two of you.You know... just
the three of us.But I wasn't.I wasn't even
present in my own life,
and now I don't have it......and I'm never
going to have it.You have Sam.Not really, I don't.
I mean, she's...No, she's just
going through...No, I get it,
I understand.She needed to have a dad......and instead she got
this guy who was a......three-day

I can't...There are things
more pathetic than that.Yeah, like?That moustache.<i>Riggan, we are in the motel.</i><i>Last scene has started.

Is that why they fear us?We have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.They fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.A man commits a crime,
he should know better.We have him killed, and we
feel pretty good about it.Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.That's not power, though.That's justice.
It's different than power.Power is when we have
everyjustification to kill,and we don't.You think that's power?That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,he's brought in
before the emperor,he throws himself down on the
ground, he begs for mercy.He knows he's going to die.And the emperor pardons him.This worthless man.
He lets him go.I think you are drunk.That's power, Amon.That is power.Amon the Good.I pardon you. (LAUGHS)<i>GOETH: What do they want?</i><i>STERN: I don't know, but they're in

keep any secrets from my spouse.Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.Madam.
Hello.What is it? We've received
an angry complaintfrom the Armaments Board.The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.Sure, so would I, so would you.I wouldn't worry about it. We'll
get it right one of these days.There's a rumor you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.Pass them off as ours.I don't see the difference.Whether they're made here
or somewhere else...You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.You'll lose a lot of money.Fewer shells will be made.Stern, if this factory
ever producesa shell that can
actually be fired,I'll be very unhappy-WOMAN: Hello, madam.
How do you do?(MACHINE GRINDING)How are you doing, Rabbi?
Rabbi!<i>Good, Herr Direktor.</i>Sun's going down.Yes, it is.What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?Is it?What's the matter with you? You
should be preparing for the Sabbath.Shouldn't you?I've got some wine.

Germany has just been announced.At midnight tonight,
the war is over.Tomorrow you'll
begin the processof looking for survivors

throughout the world.We've survived.Many of you have come up to me
and thanked me.Thank yourselves.Thank your fearless Sternand others among you

orders from our commandant,which he has received
from his superiors,to dispose of the population

Pretend it's your dick, man.How about I pretend it's your dick?You'll never get in if you did that.- Here. Let me have a shot.
- Give me a second.- No, come on. My dick, man.
- Go.Fucker.- Got that.
- Yeah.Here we go.Oh, look at that.- Nice 155, huh?
- Yeah.It's going to
do some fucking damage.Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge.I got that.Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total.That blast is going to
roast straight out there.The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnelis going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.Yep.We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way,but we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee.- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.
- No problem.Bot is moving.Let me know what you got, Eldridge.Good to go.All right. Wagon's
set up. Bot moves.Uh-oh. We got goats, guys.Goats 12:00. Watch out.Load them little bastards up.- Oh, shit.
- Shit.Oh, fuck.Wagon's having a bad day, boys.- You build that?
- No, the U.S. Army did.All right. Looks like
I'm going down there.You don't like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?Oh, I love it.So, if everything looks okay,
when I get down thereI'm just going
to set it up and bip it.Give these people
something to think about.Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us,we're just going to blow up
their little fucking road.Sounds good.Craving a burger; is that strange?- Not for you.
- No, okay.Helmet on.Happy trails.Blaster One, can you read me?Roger that, Blaster one.
You're good to go.You're looking good, Blaster One.Nice and hot in here.One fifty.Roger that, 150 metersHi.- Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.Where are you from?
Where are you from?California?- Hey, get out of here, man.
- Where?Hey, this ain't no fucking meet
and greet. Now get out of here.Now.Go.You making friends again, Sanborn?All day long.Twenty-five.Twenty-five meters. Roger that.
You are now in the kill zone.Thanks for reminding me.That's what I'm here for, baby.Okay-The debts look good.Roger that,I'm laying on the charge.Nice and sweet.We're good to go.I'm coming back.- Five meters out.
- Five meters, Roger that.Hey, Sanborn- You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening.Needs grass.We gonna start our grass business?That's right, manI'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it.It's going to be called
""Sanborn and Sons"".We'll be rich.I like that, Crabgass.
St. Augustine, man.I'm a scholar on this shit.How about this?
You sell it. I fertilize it.- 25.
- 25 meters. Roger that.Sanborn!Butcher shop, 2:00,
dude has a phone!Why is Eldridge running?- Make him put it down!
- Put down the phone!Come on, guys. Talk to me.Drop the phone!
Drop your phone!Hey, burn him, Eldridge. Burn him!- Put down the cell phone!
- Eldridge, burn him!- Get out of the way.
- Drop your phone!Make him put it down!
Go get it!- Come on, Eldridge!
- I can't get him in sight!Thompson!Anywhere's good.- Is that everything?
- Yeah.Yeah?Come in,Sergeant James.JT Sanborn, my man.Hey. Hi, how are you? Will.
I'm Will.Welcome to Bravo Company;
welcome to Camp Victory.Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty.Oh, no. They changed
that about a week ago.Victory sounds better.All right. Well, at least
I'm in the right place, right?Yeah.While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?Yeah, no problem.Maybe you shouldn't take this down.We get a lot of mortars at night.The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through.That's why it's up there.Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar roundfrom coming in through
the roof, you know.Besides, I like the sunshine.Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.- I know he was a good tech.
- Yeah, he was.He was a great team leader too.Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything.I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best.- Appreciate it.
- All right.Cool.Home sweet home, right?Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle.I'd rather be
on the side with the tanks,just in case, rather than not have them.Yeah, but they don't do anything.Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead.Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead.Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead.How's a fucking tank
supposed to stop that?- Would you shut up, Owen?
- Sorry.Just trying to scare the new guy.I saw a little bit in Afghanistan too.- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.
- Copy that.Move.Move!Blaster One, this is Victory Main.Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?Victory Main. Victory Main.
this is Blaster Mike.Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over.Victory Main, figures to follow.
Three-four-five-three is your grid.Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don't see anybody in fatigues.Give us a second to confirm.Watch your feet.Set visual
is three-four five-three.Got the Humvee.Friendly!Friendly.Ah, here we go.They abandoned their vehicle.We got an empty Humvee
over here, James.Yeah, I got it.Let's move.Friendly.- Morning, boys.
- Sir.Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys.Step out and I'll
show you what's going on.All right.Down on that block 20 meters,this side of the mosque,
east side of the street,our informant says he saw
a pair of wiresgoing into a rubble pile.- It's a possible IED.
- Yeah.- I trust this guy. I know him.
- Okay.I'll handle it.- Do you want to talk him or...
- No.Good. Keep your boys back.
We'll be good. Thank you.Specialist, bring up the Humvee.What's going on?I'm going to break out the suit.- What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it.Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?I'll handle it.That's kind of tight down here, James.Ready?Good?You don't have to go down there.
We already have the bot halfway up.I'll be all right.First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?How's it looking, Eldridge?- Good to go.
- Let's do it.- Got two of them?
- Got two.All right. Let's rock and roll, man.- He's a rowdy boy.
- He's reckless.Blaster One, what's going on?Blaster One! What are you doing?Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike.What's with the smoke
on the side of the road?Hey. James, can you hear me?What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over.Creating a diversionFrom what? Is there a threat?Eldridge, get up on the wall. Move!Tell me what you see, specialist.All right, I got him.He's walking down range.James, the smoke
is killing my visibility.Where are you
in relationship to the IED?Are you within 100 meters yet?Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you
when I'm standing over it, cowboy.Take cover!Oh, no. A car stopped
in front of him, SanbornShit. James! James, come back now.EOD pulled a nine
on this Haji in a car.Want me to send backup?I got it.- Get here!
- Negative! Negative!Stand down.The blast will come up the block.Stay clear around the corner.EOD has the situation
under control, over.Where you going?Want to back up?Get out of the car!- Get out of the car!
- Come on!What the fuck are you doing?Back up.Hello?Want to get back?It's that way.Back.Taxi's moving.Get out of the car!
Stop!Stay down!Well, if he wasn't an insurgent.
he sure the hell is now.Roger that. That's real funny.Got something.Oh, baby.Gotcha.All right.We're done.Good to go.Come down, specialist.Roger.Got a wire.Hang on.Where are you going?Secondary.Shit.Take cover. Get in the wall.
Get in the wall.That wasn't so bad. First time working
together. What do you think?I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me.- We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No.We're going on a mission,and my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions.It's combat, buddy.Hey.It's just 39 days.Thirty-eight if we survive today.Hey, it's ""Mr. Be All You Can Be"".What's up, doc?Not much. How are you?I'm good.Got a question about that
song, ""Be All You Can Be"".What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?I mean, I think it's logical.This is war. People die
all the time. Why not me?You got to change
the record in our head.You gotta start thinking
about other things.Okay.
Stop obsessing... Right now.What are you thinking about?You want to know
what I'm thinking about, doc? Yeah.This is what I'm thinking about, doc.Here's Thompson, okay.
He's dead. He's alive.Here's Thompson.
He's dead. He's alive.He's dead. He's alive.Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?Come on. You want the cool shit?Come on, come on.
It's the tight shit, man.Wanna buy DVD?
Wanna buy DVD?Fuck you.
Come, come, please, please.New releases. Look.Hello. Hello.
Want to buy DVDs? Very good. Very good.How much?One for five and two for nine.Three for twelve.Three for thirteen and I don't
give you tax. Very good, man. Look.- Look...
- No tax?All right. What do you got?
What do you got.You know, you smart shit.
You not like those stupid fucks.Yeah, I'm the smart guy.You're a smart kid.
Give me your best one, okay?- Here, this the best one.
- This is a good one?- Yeah. The best shit, man.
- Okay.Here you go,
I'll take one.- Keep the change.
- Thank you.Want a cigarette?Get out of here.
You shouldn't smoke.Thank you. Take it easy.I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again.What's that?- Yesterday.
- Mm-hmm.Wasn't cool.Yeah, I know.
You'll get it, though.- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah.I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD.We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
piece of redneck trailer trash like you.Looks like you're on the right track.We'll see you out there.Let's go, move!Shit. Get out of the way. Move.Hallo.- Where is it?
- It's behind the wall.- All right.
- See any wires? Any smoke?No, I didn't look.So, how do you know it's a bomb?Car has been parked illegally.The suspension is sagging. There's
definitely something heavy in the trunk.Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see.You want me to go close to it?Yeah. No-no. I don't. I'm kidding.Shit.It's coming from over here!Blaster One. You there?Blaster One, you hear me?Here.Shit.Let's go, guys.Let it go.I got top cover.That's a negative, specialist.Eldridge, you stay with me.Sanborn, you take top covers.Shit.Blaster Mike in position.What do you got?I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable.He's not going to make it.We're leaving in 15 minutes.Got a survival wound, sir.He's not going to make it.Oh, God.- What's he doing?
- I don't know.What are you doing?There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortable.I need my kit and my cans.What's going on down there, Eldridge?I'm getting his kit and his cans.
Cover me, please.Kit and cans.Got a lot of deck cord, electrical.I'm looking for this initiating system.Well, it's not in the back seat.I don't think.All right. It's not in the back seat.Got a young man on the roof,

It's all in here somewhere.- Hey, Sanborn.
- Yeah.You got eyes on some guy.
with a video camera?No. Where?He's right at my 12:00, you see him?
He's pointing the fucking thing at me.Shit.Negative, I don't see him.Hey, Sanborn. He's right

He's not answering.Yeah, I think he removed his headset.Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?Hey, James!Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on.Uh... that's a negative.That, yeah, that's not going to happen.I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at 6:00.- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing.Looks like, he's checking the oil.They're communicating
with your cameraman.This is real bad man.Get behind the Jersey barrier.I can't see James from here.Get down now!We can go!Bastard.We're done.Sanborn, let's get out of here.Woo.That was good.- Hey, James.

soldiers in your unit?Yeah. My team's great.
My team leader is inspiring.- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No.He's going to get me killed,almost died yesterday.At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong.You know, this doesn't have
to be a bad time in your life.Going to war is a- is a once
in a lifetime experience.It could be fun.And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?I've done my field duty.Where's that? Yale?Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.These talks are voluntary.Look, I'm sorry,I appreciate
what you're saying, I do.I appreciate our sessions together,but you need to come out from

I will.Just like every other soldierFire in the hole!Firing now.Eee, ooh...- Ready for second det?

misfire all the time.What are you doing?I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire.He'd be obliterated to nothing.His helmet would be left.
You could have that.Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside.Yeah. There'd be half
a helmet somewhere,bits of hair.Ask for a change
in technique and protocol,make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?You'd have to write the report.- Are you serious?
- I can't write it.No. I mean, are you serious
about killing him?- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV.
- Roger that.I got four armed men.They're in Haji gear.All right. Go slow and easy.Careful now.All right. Careful now, guys.- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.

of sitting behind a desk all the time.That'd be a privilege.
Hop in, Colonel.Hey. Doc.Not to insult your intelligence, sir,but if the shit hits the fan,
please don't fire out the Humvee.The round will just bounce around,
and someone might get shot.- I don't like getting shot.
- Understood. Sergeant.Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.We're just here to pick up
some unexploded ordinance.Sergeant James is

deck cord you can get your hands on.Let's get all this
ordinance out of here.And we're just gonna...
we're gonna blow the place.Roger. Just blow it.What are you doing?Yeah? Putting
the stones in to move.Yeah. That's really wonderful,but it's
a little bit unsafe today.Yeah, it's a little unsafe.So maybe... I don't know.I'm thinking maybe we should move?No?Fuck.- You all right?

we need to move. Please.You think it's that little Beckham?No, I don't.- You're positive?

We gotta go.Oh, he's dead.Hey, we gotta find
Cambridge, Doc!- Eldridge!
- Doc!Eldridge, c'mon, man. C'monI just saw him.
He was walking right here.I know. He's dead.
Look, he's dead. Okay?It's all right, man.It'll be all right, man.Hello?Hello?Will?Hello?Hello?Hey, let me ask you a question.What happened to the little kid
that used to work here?Sorry, man.
English I... no English.No-no English.
You no speak English now.Little kid. Beckham is his name.
He sells... sells DVDs.DVD. One DVD, $5.Oh, Jesus Christ.- $5.
- Excuse me, soldier,you in charge of this area here?- What's up?
- You know this guy?How do we know
that he's not giving intelto insurgents, telling them
where to drop mortars?I think he's just selling DVDs.Well, he's a security risk.
We should get rid of him.What are you looking at?He's just selling DVDs, man.
All the merchants are clear.By who?I couldn't do anything with him
until I got the clear from my CO.Okay. Fuck.Fuck.Does this change anything?You speak
English now. Don't you?- Yalla, yalla. Drive.
- Okay.- Ok.
- Is this his house?He there?Wait here.Fuck.Psst. Psst. Shh.You speak English?English. French. Arabic.Good. Open you vest.Ah, stay there. Stay.Tell me what you know about Beckham.For whom?Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb.
Stay right there.- I don't know.
- You don't know.But please, sit down,
I am Professor Navid.This is my home.You are a guest.
Please, sit down.I'm a guest.Just... I'm looking for
the people responsiblefor-for-for Beckham.You are CIA, no?I am very pleased to see
CIA in my home.Please, sit.How can I...Be careful. The gun can go off.U.S.A. friendly coming in.Stop. Stop. Get the fuck down.U.S.A. friendly.On your knees.
Get on your knees now.On your knees.
You will be shot. Don't move.On your knees. Down now.- Open your jacket!

you tell me where it is exactly?Yeah.James, do you copy?James do you have your ears on?James?This is James. What's up?- Hey.
- What's up, man?Look, we have a tank explosion
in the Green Zone.We have to post-blast assessment,see if it was a suicide bomber,and if so, how the fuck did he do it?Okay.Where'd you say you were again?I didn't, sergeant.
Let's go.What happened to your head, James?Hey, you ready?Game face, buddy. Let's go.- You ready?
- Let's do this.Rock and roll. Moving out.U.S.A. friendlies coming through.Make room, guys. Make room.Hey, Sanborn.Oh, shit!- An oil tanker?
- Yep.That's a pretty long flight, huh?This is the edge of the blast radius.Jesus.So, where's our triggerman?Burnt up in the flames, man.Suicide bomber.We're never going
to find a body in that shit.What if there was no body?What if it was a remote det?A really good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?Right here.
Perfect vantage point,outside the blast radius to sit back
and watch us clean up their mess.- Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do.I could stand to get in a little trouble.No, man. This is bullshit.You got three infantry platoons behind
you whose job it is to go Haji hunting.That ain't our fucking job.You don't say no to me, Sanborn.
I say no to you.You know there are guys
watching us right now.They're laughing at this.
Okay, I'm not okay with that.Now, turn off your goddammed
torch Because we're going.Now we know where their
oil tanker came from.No shit. Same kind.- We're close.
- Yeah.They alleyways
are probably set up on a grid.We're going to need
to split up, flush them out.Sanborn, you take one.
Eldridge, take two.I got three.
Rally point at your intersection.- Ready, move.
- Wait, rally point when?Fuck.""Ipsura, ipsura,""
Go, go!Shit. Ahh.Shit.- You got contact?
- Who was it? What's going on?- What do you got?
- It's Eldridge.Go, go.Man down. Man down.Shit. Shit. Shit.- Negative, negative. It's not him.
- He's gone.Where'd they go? Where'd they go?Tankers and troops are that way.- Let's go this way.
- Fuck.Use your torch. On three.Ready?One, two, three. Fuck.- Fuck!
- Shit.Softly, softly, softly.On three.One. Two. Three.Now. Go, go, go.- Eldridge, you okay?
- Fuck, dude. I'm hit.Hit him in the fucking leg.Come on.- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No. You're fine, man.Am I dead? Am I dead?I'm going to put some
pressure down. Come on.You're all right.Look at me, look at me.
You all right.All right, buddy. You ready to get up?
On three, ready? One, two, three.Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?Wanna buy some DVDs?
Wanna play some soccer?What's up?Come on, man.
Wanna play some...Aww. Fuck.How you doing, buddy?Doc says you're going to be okay.My fucking femur is shattered
in nine places.He said I'll be walking in six months
if I'm fucking lucky.- Six months ain't bad, huh?
- It's not bad?Fucking sucks, man.- Ah, ah!
- Take it easy.You see that? You fucking see that?That's what happens when
you shoot someone, you motherfucker.Sorry.- Sorry, Owen.
- Fuck you, Will.Really. Fuck you.Thanks for saving my life,
but we didn't have to go outlooking for trouble to get
your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.Come home safe, man.- See you on the other side, man.
- All right.Let's get out of this fucking desert!Don't move.If you keep
walking we will shoot you.Move him back.Keep that translator back.- But the bomb was forced on him.
- Get him back!Don't move! Stay still.If you keep walking
we will shoot you. IfGet that translator back, now.Give him room. Give him room.Hey, what do you got?He came walking up to our checkpoint,said he had a bomb strapped to him.But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.Then he starts begging us
to take it off of him.Help this man.
He's not a bad man.He's not a bad man? He got
a bomb strapped to him.This is a joke. He's trying
to pull us closer.Yeah. I got it. I got it.All right. Look...
Tell him to open his shirt slowlyand see what's inside.Slowly. Slowly.Jesus.All right, Sergeant,
I need a 75-meter perimeter.- Get these guys back.
- You heard what he said. Get back.You tell him to get on his knees
and touch the sky, okay?Slowly.Get down.Okay, I need your radio.- Can't we just shoot him?
- No.He's a....a family man.
He's not a bad man.He's asking for help, only help.Yeah, all right. You don't want
to die, get back! I got it.Listen, I know
we've had our differences.It happened, all right.
It's water under the bridge.This is suicide, man.That's why they call it
a suicide bomb, right?Let's do this. Come on.He says the bomb may
have a timer, please hurry.- We're good. Ready?
- Yep.Go get them.- Keep your eyes out on these.
- Yeah.Get your hands up.He says he has a family.Please help him.Now, listen.Look. It'd be a lot easier for me
to disarm thisif I just shoot you. Do you understand?What's he saying?He says I don't wish to die. I have a
family... Please take this off me.Tell him to put his hands behind his
head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.Look, that's not what I said.Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will shoot him.Listen.Listen, listen.You understand?Okay.What do you got here?He has four children.Shit.Sanborn, we got a timer.

a little help on this.Roger that. Tell me what you need.Bolt cutters.You gotta get down here
in two minutes or we're all fucked.Roger that.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.He says, please, I have a family.Sst.I know. It's okay.
You're all right. You're all right.Please, don't leave me.You weren't fucking kidding.Nope. What's this made out of?Oh, man.That's case iron steel.Shit.What's our time?- We got two minutes.
- Shit.We're going to need a torch
to get this off.Well, we don't have one of those in
the fucking truck, man.He's dead, man.Hold on, man. Let me think.
Just let me think.We're going to handle this.
It's okay. We got this.Shh, okay.Now listen, you're gonna get back.It's just we don't
got enough time, Sanborn.I just gotta...
I gotta get these bolts off.No. We got a minute and a half, man.

but they don't count, man. Who else?I don't even have a son.Well, you're going to have
plenty of time for that, amigo.- Naw, man.
- You know?I'm done.I want a son.I want a little boy, Will.I mean, how do you
do it, you know?Take the risk?I don't know, I just...I guess I don't think about it.But you realize every time you suit up,every time we go outit's life or death.
You roll the diceand you deal with it.You recognize that, don't you?Yeah.Yeah, I do.But I don't know why.Yeah.I don't know, JT.

your stuffed animals.You love your mommy, your daddy,

Yeah.You know what, buddy?Once you get older,some of the things that you love
might not seem so special anymore.Like your Jack in the Box.Maybe you realize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animaland then you forget
the few things you really love.And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's only one or two things.With me I think it's one.- Welcome to Delta Company.

On the Waterfront|1954|98|Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb|Elia Kazan|no link
Lawrence of Arabia|1962|98|Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn|David Lean|"He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.Did you know him well?I knew him.Well, nil nisi bonum.But did he really deserve...a place in here?Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?What, more words?The revolt in the desert...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.Yes, it was my privilege to know him.And to make him known to the world.He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.Thank you.He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.You, sir. Who are you?My name is Jackson Bentley.I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?No, I can't claim to have known him.I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.Knew him? I never knew him.He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.Michael George Hartley...this is a nasty, dark little room.That's right.We are not happy in it.I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.- Here you are, Tosh.
- Thanks.Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?- Is it there?
- Of course.Headlines.But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times."" Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold.""I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.And you're balmy!- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.What's the trick, then?The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.- He's balmy.
- He's all right.Lawrence.Yes?You're supposed to be...Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?Always.You should be on duty.
Where are you going?Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.I'm going for a powwow
with the general.I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.Where are you going?I must say, Lawrence!- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.Sorry.It's an intrigue, Dryden.I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss.Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.There is, indeed.He's of no use here in Cairo.He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.Knows the books, you mean.I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.Well, what more do you want?That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...giving military advice.By God, I should hope not.It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to...To what?To make our own appraisal
of the situation.I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.They're a nation of sheep-stealers.They did attack Medina.And the Turks made mincemeat of them.We don't know that.We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.Big things have small beginnings, sir.Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.Good morning, sir.Salute.If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.- It's my manner.
- Your what?My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.Why, I can't imagine.You can't perform
your present duties properly."" I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city.""- What?
- Themistocles, sir.- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.It says so in your dossier.You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.But I suppose I could be wrong.All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!Yes, what is it?The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.But there must be artillery!Sir, this is something
of an expedition.He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.He can't do that in six weeks.- Two months, then.
- Three.All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?Thank you, sir.I'd like to say, sir,
that I am gratef ul for this.Shut up and get out.Sir?How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?Find Prince Feisal.Good. And when I've found him?Find out what kind of a man he is.Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.That's new.Where are they now?Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.They're Hashemite Bedouins.They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.Thanks. This is going to be fun.Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:Bedouins and gods, and you're neither.
Take it from me.For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.Here you may drink.One cup.You do not drink?No.I'll drink when you do.I am Bedu.Truly, now, you are a British officer?Yes.From Cairo?Yes.- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.And before?From Britain?Yes.Truly?From Oxfordshire.Is that a desert country?No. A fat country. Fat people.You are not fat?No.I'm different.Here...take it.First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.Take it now.Bedu food.Good.More?- Bedu.
- Where?From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.Yes, I know.- I am not Harith.
- No.Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.When you are ready to go...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "" Hut-hut-hut.""Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.Now!Good?It's all right.This is a Harith well.The Harith are a dirty people.Turks?Bedu.Who is he?He is dead.Yes.Why?This my well.I have drunk from it.You are welcome.He was my friend.- That?
- Yes, that.- This pistol yours?
- No, his.His?Mine.Then I will use it.Your friend...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.I know.I am Ali ibn el Kharish.I have heard of you.So...what was a Hazimi doing here?He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.I have been in Cairo for my schooling.I can both read and write.My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.What is your name?My name is for my friends.None of my friends is a murderer.You are angry, English.He was nothing.The well is everything.The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.He knew that.Salaam.Sherif Ali.So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...so long will they be
a little people...a silly people.Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.Come.I will take you to Feisal.I do not want your company, sherif.Wadi Saf ra is another day from here.You will not find it,
and you will die.I will find it with this.Good army compass.How if I take it?Then you would be a thief.Have you no fear, English?My fear is my concern.Truly.God be with you, English.As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent airYou can hear the girls declareHe must be a millionaireI'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte CarloHey, you!- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.How did he know?Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.I'll give him that. No escort?My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.- Turks?
- No, an Arab.Bloody savages.- This is Wadi Saf ra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awf ul.Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.They're fading away by dozens
every night.What I want to say is this:Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--Oh, my God.Not again.I've told him!
God knows I've told him."" Move South, "" I've said.
""You're still in range.""They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!Stand and fight. Stand and fight.Fire back at them.- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.Seconded to the Arab Bureau.This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.You were right and I was wrong.We must take some thought
for the wounded.- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- lf they can get to Yenbo.They can hardly come with us.No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?Lawrence.You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.First the guns, and now this.Cigarette?I'm sorry.Cigarette, Your Excellency?Umph off.Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?Hold it, Jenkins!Jenkins!Lawrence?You have no servant.- I don't need a servant.
- No?We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.Others do battle in His cause.Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.And observe the prayers.This will be best and richest
in the recompense.Seek ye the forgiveness of God.Verily, God is forgiving, mercif ul--Greetings, Ali.- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.Yes, my lord.And now, Selim, ""The Brightness."""" By the noonday brightness...and by the night
when it darkeneth...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...neither hath He been displeased.And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past.""""And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...and thou be satisfied.""So?Yes, colonel.- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.You could supply us through Aqaba!Aqaba!If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.- But you can't!
- You could.You mean, the navy?The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.Can you imagine what that means?Yes, I can imagine.Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.You can see that, sir, surely.I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.It is of little consequence to us.I must ask you not to speak like that.British and Arab interests are
one and the same.Possibly.Upon my word, sir, you're ungratef ul.Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.No. Guns. Artillery.Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.English will teach
Bedu to fight?We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanized army.Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?I think it is far from Damascus.We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?Yes, my lord.It is beautif ul, is it not?- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.Small population compared with some.It's small, but it's great. And why?- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.Because it has a navy, because of this,
the English go where they please...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!Lawrence is not your military adviser.But I would like to hear his opinion.Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.My lord, I think...I think your book is right.The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.On this ocean, the Bedu go where they
please and strike where they please.This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.And this is the way you should
fight now.I don't know.I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.No, colonel.He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.They must say their say.But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.You'll lose another 50 men tonight.You tread heavily...but you speak the truth.I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...it is late.Colonel Brighton means to put my men
under European officers, does he not?In effect, my lord, yes.And I must do it...because the Turks have
European guns.But I fear to do it...upon my soul I do.The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.I fear they hunger for Arabia.Then you must deny it to them.You are an Englishman.
Are you not Ioyal to England?To England and to other things.To England and Arabia both?And is that possible?I think you are another of these
desert-Ioving English.Doughty, Stanhope...Gordon of Khartoum.No Arab loves the desert.We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.And no man needs nothing.Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...because we are a little people,
a silly people...greedy, barbarous and cruel?Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...when London was a village.Yes, you were great.Nine centuries ago.Time to be great again, my lord.Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.But my father is old...and I...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...or...Or?What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence.We need a miracle.Aqaba.Aqaba.From the land.You are mad.To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nef ud Desert.That's right.The Nef ud cannot be crossed.I'll cross it if you will.You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.The Nef ud is the worst place
God created.I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.Fifty men?Fifty? Against Aqaba?If 50 men came out of the Nef ud...they would be 50 men
other men might join.The Howeitat are there, I hear.The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.- Good fighters, though.
- Good--Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.Aqaba's over there.It's only a matter of going.You are mad.And where are you going, lieutenant?With 50 of my men.To work your miracle.Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.- Who told you?
- Ali did.Why not you?You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?Yes, I must.But I will spare these to you.Did Ali break confidence to tell me?Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.No.Since you do know...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.But in whose name do you ride?Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.They were here. I caught them.Why are you here? Boy!To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.You have been tracking us.- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.Our camel strayed. We followed her.She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.Don't do that.No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.Be warned. They are not suitable.They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.These are not servants.
These are worshippers.One shilling, every week?That is fair.- Each?
- No.- That is too much.
- All right.They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.There is the railway.And that is the desert.From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.For the camels, no water at all.If the camels die...we die.And in 20 days they will start to die.There's no time to waste, then,
is there?I was thinking.You were drifting.Yes. It will not happen again.Be warned, you were drifting.It will not happen again.That water is wasted.From now on,
we must travel by night...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.A few hours each day.Why don't we start now?No. We will rest now.Three hours.Fine.I'll wake you.Do we rest here?There is no rest now short of water.The other side of that.And how much of that is there?I'm not sure.But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.This is the sun's anvil.Have we done it?No, but we're off the anvil.Thank God for that anyway.Yes, thank Him.Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.I know.We've done it.God willing.When do we reach the wells?God willing, midday.- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.Gasim's.What's happened to him?God knows.Why don't you stop?For what? He will be dead by midday.We must go back.What for, to die with Gasim?In one hour comes the sun.In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!I can.Take the boys.If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.Gasim you have killed already.Get out of my way.Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.Nothing is written!Go back, then!What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?English blasphemer!Aqaba?Was it Aqaba?You will not be at Aqaba, English!Go back, blasphemer...but you will not be at Aqaba.I shall be at Aqaba.That is written.In here.English!English!Lawrence! Daud!Nothing is written.Al Lawrence.Farraj.Wash.Al Lawrence.Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.No.You have an elder brother.But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.He didn't marry my mother.I see.I'm sorry.It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.Yes, I suppose I am.Al Lawrence is best.All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.Very fine.- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.- Is it permitted?
- Surely.He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.They are good for riding. Try.What are you doing, Englishman?As you see.Are you alone?Almost.Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?Yours?I am Auda Abu Tayi.I've heard of another man
of that name.Other? What other?The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.He must be a great hero.He is.He wouldn't ref use water to men coming
out of Nef ud Desert.Now, would he not?No, that must be some other man.Here is my help.Son, what fashion is this?- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?A Beni Wejh sherif.And is he Harith?No, Father, English.Son...they are stealing our water.Tell them we are coming.Tell them.- Empty that!
- Do not!It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.It is Ali of the Harith who answers.Harith.Ali.Does your father still steal?No.Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?No. There is no resemblance.Alas, you resemble your father.- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.I knew your father well.Did you know your own?We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...nor the sultan himself desire that.Call off your men.This honours the unworthy.I've only just begun to teach him.And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?Be not clever with me, English.- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.Is he your tongue?We do desire it.Then it is given, if you will take it.I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the Turks
to buy you, friends of Feisal.But...dine with me.Dine with Auda, English.Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!This thing you work against Aqaba...what profit do you hope from it?We work it for Feisal of Mecca.The Harith do not work for profit.Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.But I...
I cannot serve.You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.Yes, it is my pleasure.We do not work this thing for Feisal.No?- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.The Arabs?The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.I have even heard of the Harith.But the Arabs?What tribe is that?They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.Well, they are nothing to me.My tribe is the Howeitat.Who work only for profit.Who work at Auda's pleasure.And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.Serve?I serve?It is the servant who takes money.I am Auda Abu Tayi.- Does Auda serve?
- No!- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!Because I am a river to my people.Is that service?No.And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.And lost his taste for fighting.It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.Why should they wish to?Now...I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...a servant's wages.They pay me, month by month...100 golden guineas.150, Auda.- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.And a long tongue between them.100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.A trifle which they take
f rom a great box they have.In Aqaba.- In Aqaba?
- Where else?You trouble me like women.Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda won't come to Aqaba.- For money?
- No.- For Feisal?
- No!Nor to drive away the Turks.He will come...because it is his pleasure.Thy mother mated with a scorpion.Make God your agent!Aqaba!Aqaba!God be with you.God be with you.God be with you.God be with you.Yes.Aqaba.Tomorrow we will go and get it.- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.If you are right about the guns.He killed. He dies.This is the end of Aqaba.- One of our men murdered Auda's man.
- Why?Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.Ali!It is an ancient wound.I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.It is the law, Lawrence.The law says the man must die.If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?Yes.Sherif Ali!If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...- ...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.Then I will execute the law.I have no tribe.And no one is offended.Gasim.Did you do it?Well, Lawrence...What ails the Englishman?That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nef ud.It was written, then.Better to have left him.It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.Besides, it was necessary.You gave life and you took it.The writing is still yours.Auda Abu Tayi!The miracle is accomplished.Garlands for the conqueror.Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.I'm none of those things, Ali.- What, then?
- Don't know.Thanks.My God, I love this country.What!No gold in Aqaba!Auda, I found it!That's a pity.Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.And you?I'm going to tell the generals...in Cairo.Yes, cross Sinai.Come on!Sinai?Yes.- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:""We've taken Aqaba, ""
the generals would laugh.I see.In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.You'll wear trousers and tell stories
ofour quaintness and barbarity...and then they will believe you.You're an ignorant man.Paper.Paper!There is no gold in Aqaba.No gold.No great box!Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?For my pleasure, as you said.But gold is honorable...and Lawrence promised gold.Lawrence lied.See, Auda.""The Crown of England...promises to pay...5000 golden guineas...to Auda Abu Tayi.""Signed in His Majesty's absence...by...me.In 10 days...I'll be back with the gold.With gold, with guns, with everything.Ten days.You'll cross Sinai?Why not?Moses did.And you will take the children?Moses did.Moses was a prophet...and beloved of God.He said there was gold here.
He lied.He is not perfect.Lord, can we not rest?I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.Have you two slept in beds?Farraj?Daud?With sheets?Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.I promise.Then it shall be so, lord.Look!Pillar of fire.No, lord. Dust.My compass.No matter.If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.Due west.Come on!Lawrence!Farraj!Farraj, don't! Don't!Don't!Why do you walk?But why, lord?But why, lord?There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.Lawrence, look!It's all right, Farraj.It's all right.Who are you?Who are you?- Daud!
- We're here, sir.You taking him in there?Yes.Here!Here. You!And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?We are thirsty.- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.You can't take him in there, sir.What do you think you look like?No, no. You must go.No, no. Go, effendi, go!Get out! You must get out! Get out!We want two large glasses of lemonade.- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.What's going on?- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.Explain yourself.We've taken Aqaba.- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.We have.He likes your lemonade.You mean the Turks have gone?No, they're still there
but they've no boots.Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.That's not true. We killed some.Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.I did it.You'd better talk to Allenby.- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.That's a step in the right direction.First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?See Allenby first, though.Will he see me?I think so.Do that, then.- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.You'd better get into
some trousers too."" Undisciplined.Unpunctual.Untidy.Several languages.Knowledge of music...literature.Knowledge of...Knowledge of...""You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.- Sir.
- Sir.Then why did you?- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.True.And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.Am I going for Jerusalem?Yes.Very well.Aqaba behind my right.It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.Anything else?Yes.Aqaba's linked with Medina.Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?No. I think you should
leave them there.You acted without orders, you know.Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?Not really. It's awfully dangerous.Yes, I know.Already?Yes.I'm promoting you major.I don't think that's a very good idea.I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...and carry on the good work.No. Thank you, sir.- Why not?
- Well, l, it's...Let me see now...I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.One was a boy.That was...yesterday.I led him into a quicksand.The other was a man.That was...before Aqaba, anyway.I had to execute him with my pistol.There was something about it
I didn't like.- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.That's all right.
Let it be a warning.No. Something else.What, then?I enjoyed it.Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?Yes. Entirely.Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.Fascinating gear they wear.How would I look in this, Harry?- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.Really? What do you think, Dryden?Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.I don't think it matters
what his motives were.It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!Let's have a drink, gentlemen.- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!Come on, then.You're a clever man, sir.No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.That's fair, surely?If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.- Bravo.
- You know better?I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?Easy, gentlemen, please.- Give us a drink.
- Of course, sir.I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.Tracy.Shall we go outside?So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?Yes.With 1000 Arabs?1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.Delivered anywhere, day or night.It means 1000 camels.That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.I'll smash his railways.While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.You are going back, then?Yes.Of course I'm going back.Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handf ul of bandits...he'll withdraw.He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.- I wonder who will.
- No one will.Arabia's for the Arabs now.That's what I've told them anyway.That's what they think.- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.They've only one suspicion.That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.Have we?I'm not a politician, thank God.Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?Difficult question, sir.I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.Certainly.2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.Right.Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.More money.- How much more?
- 25, 000 now. A lot more later.- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.A couple of armoured cars.Right.Field artillery.Right.I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.Congratulations!Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?I was wondering that, sir.Might be difficult to get it back.Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.Then I can't give it to them, can I?- For you to say.
- No, it's not.I've got orders to obey, thank God.Not like that poor devil.He's riding the whirlwind.Let's hope we're not.Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?To Prince Feisal.- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.You know him though?He is my master. I am his servant.Can you read?Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.Now...- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?Not altogether, sir, no.Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?I don't know.- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.A void Mellaha, the Turks are there.In Mellaha now? They move fast.They do.But not so fast as we do,
you will find.Myself...I am going to Cairo.- As you know.
- Yes.There's work for me there
of a different kind.Yes.I know you've been
given no artillery.- That is so.
- You're handicapped?It restricts us to small things.It's intended to.Do you know General Allenby?Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.- Excuse me?
- A clever man.Slim customer. It's very good.I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...who struggle for their freedom.Very gratifying.Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.I badly want a story to tell.Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?I will give you a guide and a letter.And before I leave here...which must be presently...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.I do, sir.Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?My army is made up of tribes.The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?Oh, yes. And the rightly.In this country, Mr. Bentley...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...beyond every other man.One figure I can give you
f rom my head...because it never leaves my head.Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...37 wounded...156 dead.You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.Yeah.Four times as many.That's because those too badly wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.We leave no wounded for the Turks.- You mean...?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...and are treated harshly.How harshly?More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.I see.Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?Why should you suppose?It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.That is exactly so.With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.With me, it is merely good manners.You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.Thank you, sir.Can you manage the letter--?I'll do everything I have said...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...in my people and Major Lawrence.It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.Oh, no.But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.And Turkey.I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is...- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.All right. Yes.Lawrence is your man.Stop!Stop it!Stop it!Come on, men!Lawrence!Good God! God!Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.Why don't you take a picture?Wish I had.How is it with thee, Lawrence?Am I in this?Did you take his picture?Yeah.You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.Charming company you keep.Auda?He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.He thinks you're a kind of thief.It's all right to take your picture?- All right.
- Okay.Just walk.Major Lawrence!Yes, sir, that's my baby.This looting has got to stop!It is customary.It's theft. And theft makes thieves.I would not say that to Auda.- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.They'll come back.He says they'll come back.
Will they?Not this year, Lawrence.Look, Lawrence, how many men do you
think you'll have left? 200?- Less.
- Well, then?I said, they'll come back.You badly hurt?Not hurt at all.Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?I will tell you that
when I have a country.Did I answer well?You answered without saying anything.
That's politics.You learn quickly.I have a good teacher.Yeah.- How's your hurt?
- Fine.Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...may I put two questions to you,
straight?I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.One.What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?They hope to gain their freedom.Freedom.""They hope to gain their freedom.""- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.I'm going to give it to them.The second question?Well, I was going to ask...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?It's clean.Well, now...that's a very illuminating answer.May I...take one farewell picture?I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.One clock for two lamps.A fair bargain.Fair? I robbed him.Trash.I must find something honorable.Honorable?The year is running out, Brighton.I must find something honorable.Now you may blow up my train.And what will you do now?Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.They will carry my toys too, see?Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.When you've got what you want,
you will go home.No, I shan't, Auda.Then you are a fool.Maybe. But I am not a deserter.Give thanks to God, Brighton...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.You are an impudent rascal.I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.Like talking to a brick wall.So what will you do now?
What can you do?I'll go north.That's what Allenby wants.Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.Then that's where I'll take it.Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.Won't we?Train, Farraj.Yeah, Lawrence.Hide yourself, my friend.Detonator.All right, fetch another.- Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.Farraj?- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!He cannot ride.If they take him alive, you know what
they'll do to him.Daud will be angry with you.Salute him for me.What will you do now?Go north.With twenty?What would you recommend me to do?What would you recommend?He hasn't 1l10 so many men, sir.He's lied, in fact.Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.Then there is an Arab north army.- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.Do you think he's gone native, Harry?No.He would if he could, I think.- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.What matters is I believed it.The Turks believe it.They are offering 20, 000 pounds
for him.Good heavens.- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Well, he's a brave man--Surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.What about next year?
Will they still come back?I wouldn't be surprised.- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?- Now may I speak?
- Yes.One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.So say they love you.The more reason to be thrifty
with them.Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.They must move mountains,
walk on water.That's right. That's right.Who are you to know what can be done?If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.Whatever I ask them to do can be done.
They know that if you don't.Do you think I'm just anybody?Do you?My friends, who will walk on water
with me?- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.Will you take 20 against 2000?- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?I told the English generals...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.Or perhaps you are here...for the English generals.Who says this?Rumour.That is not an argument.Oh, argument.This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...while the Arabs argue.Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.It's madness.What are you looking for?Some way to announce myself.Be patient with him, God.- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.Halt!Walk on.- Halt!
- Walk on.You and you.You.You have blue eyes.- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.How old are you?Twenty-seven, effendi.I think.You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.It's an interesting face.I am surrounded by cattle.He wouldn't know an interesting face
f rom a sow's belly.I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...isolated.You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.No, effendi.Have you?No.That would be too...lucky.Where did you get that?- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.Yes, you are a deserter.But from which army?Not that it matters at all.A man cannot be always in uniform.Your skin is very fair.Beat him.To me!Sleep.Sleep.Eat.Eat.You have a body, like other men.Good.Then sleep.Better?Much better. You were right.Rest, rest. Can you not learn?Oh, I've learned all right.I'm going, Ali.- Why?
- Why?Heavens.Why?I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.And the end of the Arab revolt?I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.I'm sorry. I thought it was true.You proved it.Look, Ali. Look.That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.And there's nothing I can do about it.A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.He can...but he can't want what he wants.This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.- I tried to.
- So would any man.Well, any man is what I am.And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...that any man can do.Allenby's in Jerusalem.- I'll make easy stages.
- You?Oh, yes. Easy stages.Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...ordinarily...happy.Can I take this?It is not clean.No, but it's warm.And these...having led them here,
have you no care for them?You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.And let me go back to mine.- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.Mind if I join you?Honoured, sir.- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.- What's doing out there?
- Where?- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?We're settling in.
We built a squash court.Jolly good.Well, I have to go up there.It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.Bloody wogs.Yes, probably.Jolly good about the squash court.Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?Morning.- Good morning.
- Good to be back.- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.Hello.Morning. You're to go right in.Lawrence.Or is it Major Lawrence?Sir.Well, general, I will leave you.Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...about my people
and their weakness...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.I told you, no such treaty exists.Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.I know this treaty does exist.Treaty, sir?He does it better than you, general.But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.You really don't know?Then what the devil's this?It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.Why? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?No.- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.Well, now...Mr. Sykes is as English civil servant.Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.Including Arabia.They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.An agreement to that effect.There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.And let's have
no displays of indignation.You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.The truth is I'm an ordinary man.You might have told me that, Dryden.And I want an ordinary job, sir.That's my reason for resigning.It's personal.- Personal?
- Yes, sir.Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.And as it happens,
a damned important one. Are you mad?No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.That's my reason too.Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...and you are part of it.Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!I don't want to be part
of your big push!What about your Arab friends?I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!What in hell do you want, Lawrence?I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.- Lawrence.
- Yes?Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.Thank you, sir.Why don't we...?There's blood on your back.- Do you want a doctor?
- No.Tell me what happened.Say, what goes on in there?- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.Will you kindly allow me to pass?Walk away, Dryden, walk away.Always walking away, aren't you?Well, I'll tell you.It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.I believe your name will
be a household word...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.Leave me alone.- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.All right, I'm extraordinary.What of it?Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.It's a terrible thing
for a man to funk it if he has.Are you speaking from experience?No.You're guessing, then.Suppose you're wrong.Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all--The 16th?Can you do it?
I'll give you a lot of money.- Artillery?
- I can't.They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.They'll be coming for Damascus.Which I'm going to give them.That's all I want.All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.And when we've got it, we'll keep it.Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.Fair enough.Fair? What's fair got to do with it?It's going to happen.I shall want quite a lot of money.All there is.Not that much.The best of them won't come for money.They'll come for me.No pictures!It's not for you, it's for Lawrence.He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.Well, there's only one Lawrence.Have you met Lawrence
since he's come back?Yes.- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.What did the English
do to him in Jerusalem?Search me. Ask Lawrence.- I did.
- What did he say?He laughed.He told me to gather the Harith here.He offered me money.Did you take it?No. But many did.- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.There is not a man
without a price on his head.- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.The sheiks will hang these men.These men are mine.Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.Aye, but for what?Sherif, for Lawrence.- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.That is different.
These are not ordinary men.I don't want ordinary men. Hut!Damascus!Damascus! Damascus!Damascus! Damascus!Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--Certainly.He can't be far from Mallud...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.Splendid. Philip.These are the last infantry supports
going up now.But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.Any questions?This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.Where are they now?- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.Pound them, Charley.Pound them.God help the men who lie under that.They're Turks.God help them.Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.Cocky?More than cocky, sir.He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.- Unless...
- Unless?Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.I wonder where they are now.No prisoners.Damascus, Lawrence.Lawrence, not this.Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.No prisoners.This was Talaal's village.Talaal!Talaal!No prisoners!No prisoners!God.God.God!Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!Major!Major Lawrence!Jesus wept.Jesus wept.Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.Barbarous and cruel.Who but they?Who but they?Oh, you rotten man.Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.For the rotten bloody newspapers.These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.Damascus!Take them to Sherif Ali.Tell him.Remind him.- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.Tell Sherif Ali that.They are not ripe.General salute!Present arms!Port arms!Lawrence is behind it, sir.The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.- When?
- A day and a night, sir.They've been here a day and a night.They've occupied the town.
They've done it.He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.What else beside the town hall?Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.They call themselves
the Arab National Council...and they're in the town hall.Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.What should we do?Get them out of it, sir, quick time.How about that, Dryden?Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?By special train in two days' time.Two days.Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.Does that apply to technical units?Technical units particularly.Yes, sir.Medicals too, sir?I'm af raid so, Harry.Medicals too.We here...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.He insulted me.Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.They will not work because
they are given no electricity.The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.You speak to me of bloodshed?I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.Humbly?Humbly, Harith?Yes, humbly.This is a new trick.Why is there no electricity?I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.There are three large machines.He means generators!So.One of them is burning.They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.It is so of all machines.Let them burn.
What need of telephones?- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.Take--Fire has broken out.- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!Then use the fire brigade!We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.Then you must carry it.- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?We will hear petitions this afternoon.This afternoon!- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.Sorry, sir.Maybe it's the bulb.No, sir.It's the power.They're leaving.That's it, then.Marvellous-Iooking beggars,
aren't they?Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.- Come where?
- Back.I know your heart.What is it?Is it this?I tell you, this is nothing.Is it the blood?The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.I pray that I may never
see the desert again.Hear me, God.You will come.
There is only the desert for you.What about you?No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.A very low occupation.I had not thought of it
when I met you.You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.It's what I came for.And then...it would be something.Yes.Much.- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.- You love him.
- I fear him.Then why do you weep?If I fear him, who love him...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?Take your hand away, Howeitat!So you are not yet
entirely politician.Not yet.Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.And Allah be thanked.I'll tell thee what...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.No, sir, I will not.Control yourself.Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.What's it like?This is outrageous!Outrageous!Outrageous!You filthy little wog!My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that."" My friend Lawrence.""How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.He longs for the greenness
of his native land.He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?Already in imagination,
he catches trout...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.You're promoted colonel.Yes. What for?Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.Then, thank you.Well, then...Godspeed.There's nothing further here
for a warrior.We drive bargains. Old men's work.Young men make wars, and the virtues
of war are the virtues of young men.Courage and hope for the future.Then old men make the peace.And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.Mistrust and caution.It must be so.What I owe you is beyond evaluation.The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.The pumping plant I must retain.If you retain it,
there will be no water.- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.- Have you men?
- Enough of that.It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.I'm sure your government...does not wish to appear at
the peace conference as an aggressor.I say!It's Lawrence, isn't it?May I shake your hand, sir?Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.Haven't we met before?Don't think so, sir.No, no, sir, I should remember that.It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.They have no power. It's illusory.Illusions can be very powerf ul.Particularly...when they take this form.The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...liberated by the Arab army.Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?I thought I was a hard man, sir.You are merely a general.I must be a king.Excuse me, sir.Well?Well...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...with an Arab flag on it.Do you think it was worth it?Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.Yes, sir.So you keep saying.You, I suspect...are chief architect
of this compromise.- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.Well, sir. Going home.Home, sir.Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave youThough it breaks my heart to go"
Rebecca|1940|100|Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, George Sanders|Alfred Hitchcock|"https://t.me/RickyChannelLast night,
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate
leading to the drive,and for a while, I could not enter,
for the way was barred to me.Then, like all dreamers,I was possessed of a sudden
with supernatural powersand passed like a spirit
through the barrier before me.The drive wound away in front of me,twisting and turning
as it had always done.But as I advanced,I was aware
that a change had come upon it.Nature had come into her own again,
and little by littlehad encroached upon the drive
with long, tenacious fingers.On and on wound the poor thread
that had once been our drive,and finally, there was Manderley.Manderley, secretive and silent.Time could not mar
the perfect symmetry of those walls.Moonlight can play odd tricks
upon the fancy,and suddenly it seemed to me
that light came from the windows.And then a cloud came upon the moonand hovered an instant
like a dark hand before a face.The illusion went with it.I looked upon a desolate shellwith no whisper of the past
about its staring walls.We can never go back to Manderley again.That much is certain.But sometimes in my dreams,
I do go backto the strange days of my lifewhich began for me
in the South of France.No! Stop!What the devil are you shouting about?Who are you? What are you staring at?I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare,
but I... I only thought...Oh, you did, did you?
Well, what are you doing here?I was only walking.Well, get on with your walking.
Don't hang about here screaming.I'll never come to Monte Carlo
out of season again.Not a single well-known personality
in the hotel.Stone cold. Waiter!Garcon! Call him.
Tell him to get me some...Why, it's Max de Winter.How do you do?I'm Edythe Van Hopper.
It's so nice to run into you here,just when I was beginning to despair of
finding any old friends here in Monte.But do sit down and have some coffee.Mr. De Winter is having
some coffee with me.Go and ask that stupid waiter
for another cup.I'm afraid I must contradict you.You shall both have coffee with me.Garcon. Coffee, please.- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.You know,
I recognized you as soon as you came in,though I haven't seen you since that
night at the casino at Palm Beach.Perhaps you don't remember
an old woman like me.Are you playing the tables much
here at Monte?No. I'm afraid that sort of thing
ceased to amuse me years ago.I can well understand that.As for me, if I had
a home like Manderley,I should certainly never come to Monte.I hear it's one of the biggest places
in that part of the country,and you just can't beat it for beauty.What do you think of Monte Carlo?
Or don't you think of it at all?Well, I think it's rather artificial.She's spoiled, Mr. De Winter,
that's her trouble.Most girls will give their eyes
for a chance to see Monte.Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?Now that we've found each other again,
I hope I shall see something of you.You must come and have a drink
in my suite.I hope they've given you a good room.The place is empty, so if you're
uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.Your valet has unpacked for you,
I suppose?I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you would like to do it for me?Well, I... I hardly think...Perhaps you could make yourself
useful to Mr. De Winterif he wants anything done.You're a capable child in many ways.That's a charming suggestion,
but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,""He travels fastest who travels alone. ""
Perhaps you've not heard it. Good night.What do you make of that?Do you suppose that sudden departure
was intended to be funny?Come, don't sit there gawking,
let's go upstairs.- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.I remember, when I was younger,
there was a well-known writerwho used to dart down the back way
whenever he saw me coming.I suppose he was in love with me
and wasn't quite sure of himself.Well, c'est la vie.By the way, my dear,
don't think that I mean to be unkind,but you were just a teeny-weeny bit
forward with Mr. De Winter.Your effort to enter the conversation
quite embarrassed me,and I'm sure it did him.
Men loathe that sort of thing.Oh, come, don't sulk. After all,
I am responsible for your behavior here.Perhaps he didn't notice it.Poor thing, I suppose he just
can't get over his wife's death.They say he simply adored her.Oh... How awkward of me.What a stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry.Please don't bother.
It doesn't really matter.No, leave that, leave that.
Go and lay another place at my table.- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.- Why not?
- Oh, well, please don't be polite. I...It's very kind of you but I'll be
all right if they just change the cloth.I wasn't being polite.I should have asked you
to have lunch with meeven if you hadn't upset the vase
so clumsily.Come along.We needn't talk to each other
if we don't feel like it.Well, thank you very much.Oh, I... I'll just have
some scrambled eggs.Oui, mademoiselle.- What's happened to your friend?
- She's ill in bed with a cold.I'm sorry I was so
rude to you yesterday.The only excuse I can offer is that I've
become boorish through living alone.You weren't really.
You simply wanted to be alone and...Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper
a friend of yours or just a relation?No, she's my employer.
I'm what is known as ""a paid companion. ""I didn't know companionship
could be bought.I looked at the word ""companion""
in the dictionary once.It said, ""a friend of the bosom. ""I don't envy you the privilege.Well, she's very kind, really,
and I have to earn my living.Haven't you any family?No. My mother died years and years ago,and there was only my father,
and he died last summer.And then I took this job.How rotten for you.Yes, it was rather, because, you see,
we got on so well together.You and your father?Yes. He was a lovely person,
very unusual.- What was he?
- A painter.Ah! Was he a good one?Well, I thought so,
but people didn't understand him.Yes, that's often the trouble.He painted trees.
At least, it was one tree.You mean, he painted the same tree
over and over again?Yes. You see, he had a theory that
if you should find one perfect thingor place or person,
you should stick to it.Do you think that's really silly?Not at all.
I'm a firm believer in that myself.And what did you find to do with
yourself while he was painting his tree?Well, I sat with him and I sketched a
little. I don't do it very well, though.Were you going sketching
this afternoon?Yes.- Where?
- Well, I haven't made up my mind.I'll drive you somewhere in the car.Oh, no, please, I didn't mean...Oh, nonsense. Finish up that mess,
and we'll get along.Thank you. It's very kind of you,
but I'm not very hungry.Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.You've taken long enough
for that sketch.I shall expect a really fine
work of art.Oh, no, don't look at it.
It's not nearly good enough.Well, it can't be as bad as all that.
Now don't rub it all out.Let me see it first.Well, it's the perspective.
I never can get it right.Let me see it, let me see it. Oh, dear.Tell me, is it the perspective
that gives my nose that curioustwist in the middle?Well, you're not a very easy subject
to sketch. Your...Your expression keeps changing
all the time.Does it?Well, I'd... I'd concentrate on the view
instead, if I were you.Much more worthwhile.It rather reminds me of our coastline
at home. Do you know Cornwall at all?Yes, I went there once with my father
on holiday. I was in a shop once,and I saw a postcard with a beautiful
house on it, right by the sea.I asked whose house it was, and
the old lady said, ""That's Manderley. ""I felt ashamed for not knowing.Manderley is beautiful.But to me,
it's just the place where I was born,and have lived in all my life.But now, I don't suppose
I shall ever see it again.We're lucky not to be home
during the bad weather, aren't we?I can't ever remember enjoying
swimming in England till June, can you?The water's so warm here
that I could stay in all day.There's a dangerous undertow and
there was a man drowned here last year.I never have any fear of drowning.
Have you?Come, I'll take you home.Oh, yes, I know Mr. De Winter well.
I knew his wife, too.Before she married, she was the
beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.She was drowned, poor dear,
while she was sailing near Manderley.He never talks about it, of course,
but he's a broken man.I suppose I'd better have it.Wretched stuff!
Give me a chocolate, quick!Oh, there you are. It's about time.Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.She was the beautiful
Rebecca Hildreth, you know.They say he simply adored her.She was the beautiful Rebecca
Hildreth, you know.I suppose he just can't
get over his wife's death.She was the beautiful Rebecca
Hildreth, you know.But he's a broken man.Bonjour.- Well, where are you going?
- I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.I see.I suppose you've had a look at the pro,
and he's desperately handsome,and you've conceived
a schoolgirl crush on him.All right. Go ahead.
Make the most of it.Off duty?Well, yes. Mrs. Van Hopper's
cold's turned into flu,so she's got a trained nurse.I'm sorry for the nurse.
You keen on tennis?- Well, not particularly.
- That's good. We'll go for a drive.Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.
How are you feeling?You got on rather well
with him, didn't you?That pro must have been teaching you
other things than tennis.Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.I wonder
if Mr. De Winter is still in the hotel.May I go now?For the number of lessons you've had,
you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.But this will be your last,
so make the most of it.The trouble is, with me laid up like
this, you haven't had enough to do.I'm getting rid of that nurse today. And
from now on, you'll stick to your job.Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.- Nurse?
- Yes, Mrs. Hopper?Are you absolutely sure you left
those messages for Mr. De Winter?- Why, yes, madame.
- I simply can't believe it.He would most certainly
have called me back.Oh, well. Poor boy, I simply hate
to see him so alone.You know, I... I wish there could be
an inventionthat bottled up the memory,
like perfume, and it never faded,never got stale.Then whenever I wanted to,
I could uncork the bottleand live the memory all over again.And what particular moment in your
young life would you want to keep?All of them. All these last few days.I feel as though I'd... I'd collected
a whole shelf full of bottles.Sometimes, you know,
those little bottles contain demonsthat have a way of popping out at you,just as you're trying
most desperately to forget.Stop biting your nails.I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed
in black satin with a string of pearls.You wouldn't be here
with me if you were.Would you please tell me, Mr. De Winter,
why you asked me to come out with you?It's obvious you want to be kind, but
why do you choose me for your charity?I asked you to come out with me
because I wanted your company.You've blotted out
the past for me more thanall the bright lights
of Monte Carlo.But if you think I just asked you
out of kindness or charity,you can leave the car now
and find your own way home.Go on. Open the door and get out.- Better blow your nose.
- Thank you.Please don't call me Mr. De Winter.I have a very impressive array
of first names.George Fortescue Maximilian.You needn't bother with them all
at once. My family call me Maxim.And another thing,please promise me
never to wear black satin or pearls,or to be 36 years old.Yes, Maxim.For the love of Pete! Come here!What do you think?
My daughter's engaged to be married.Oh, really? How nice!We must leave for New York at once.
Get reservations on the Aquitania,and we'll take the 12:30 train
for Cherbourg.Hurry up and get me the maid
to help with the packing.We've no time to waste.
Go on and don't dawdle.Mr. De Winter, please.He's gone out riding?He won't be back till noon?Give me the porter, please.I'll go and see
if there's anything left in my room.Has Mr. De Winter come in yet?Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?I was looking for my book.
I suppose I've packed it.Well, come on,
the car's waiting at the door.I'd like to leave a forwarding address,
if they happen to find that book.- Would you ring Mr. De Winter, please?
- Yes, madame.- There isn't any answer.
- Thank you.- Tell her to hurry up!
- Yes, madame.I was looking for Mr. De Winter.Mr. De Winter just ordered breakfast
in his room, mademoiselle.Come in.Hello. What are you doing here?Anything the matter?I've come to say goodbye.
We're going away.What on Earth are you talking about?It's true. We're going now,and I was afraid
I wouldn't see you again.- Where's she taking you to?
- New York. I don't want to go.I shall hate it.
I shall be miserable.I'll dress in here.I shan't be long.Which would you prefer,
New York or Manderley?Oh, please don't joke about it.Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting.
I'd better say goodbye now.I'll repeat what I said.Either you go to America
with Mrs. Van Hopper,or you come home to Manderley with me.You mean you want a secretary
or something?I'm asking you to marry me,
you little fool.Come in.Is that my food? I'm famished.
I didn't have any breakfast.My suggestion didn't seem
to go at all well. Sorry.Oh, but you don't understand.
It's the...- I'm not the sort of person men marry.
- What on Earth do you mean?I don't belong in your sort of world,
for one thing.Well, what is my sort of world?Well, Manderley. You know what I mean.Well, I'm the best judge of whether
you belong there or not.Of course, if you don't love me,
that's a different thing.Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.I do love you.
I love you most dreadfully.I've been crying all morning because
I thought I'd never see you again.Bless you for that.I'll remind you of this one day
and you won't believe me.It's a pity you have to grow up.Well, now that's settled.
You may pour me out some coffee.Two lumps of sugar and some milk,
please. Same with my tea, don't forget.Who is going to break the news to
Mrs. Van Hopper? Shall you or should I?You tell her. She'll be so angry.What's the number of her room?She's not there.
She's downstairs in the car.Hello. Give me the desk, please.Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper
waiting outside in her car.Would you ask her,
with my compliments,if she'd very kindly come up
and see me in my room?Yes, in my room.Mr. De Winter says
please for you to come up to his room.Mr. De Winter?Why, certainly.This isn't at all
your idea of a proposal, is it?It should be in a conservatory,you in a white frock,
with a red rose in your hand,and a violin playing in the distance,and I should be making violent love
to you behind a palm tree.Poor darling. Never mind.I don't mind.Don't worry. Don't worry.
You won't have to say a word.I'm so glad you called me,
Mr. De Winter.I was making a hasty departure.It was so rude of me
not to let you know.But a cable came this morning
announcing that my daughteris engaged to be married.That's rather a coincidence,
Mrs. Van Hopper.I asked you up here in order
to tell you of my engagement.You don't mean it.
How perfectly wonderful.How romantic. Who is the lucky lady?I apologize for depriving you
of your companion in this abrupt way.I do hope it won't inconvenience you
too greatly.When did all this happen?Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Just a few minutes ago.I simply can't believe it.And I suppose I ought to scold youfor not having breathed a word
of all of this to me.What am I thinking of?I should give you both
my congratulations and my blessings.I'm very happy for you both.- When and where is the wedding to be?
- Here, as soon as possible.A whirlwind romance. Splendid! I can
easily postpone my sailing for a week.This poor child has no mother,so I shall take responsibility
for all the arrangements.Trousseau, reception and everything,
and I'll give the bride away.But our luggage.Go down and tell the porter
to take everything out of the car.Just a minute. We're most
grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper,but I think we'd both prefer to
have it all as quiet as possible.And I couldn't possibly allow you
to change your sailing plans.- Oh, but...
- No, no, no.Dear, I'll go down and see that
your luggage is brought back.Thank you, Maxim.So this is what's been happening
during my illness.Tennis lessons, my foot.I suppose I've to hand it to you
for a fast worker.How did you manage it?Still waters certainly run deep.Tell me, have you been doing
anything you shouldn't?- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, never mind.I always did say that Englishmen
have strange tastes.You certainly have your work cut out
as mistress of Manderley.To be perfectly frank with you,
my dear, I can't see you doing it.You haven't the experience,you haven't the faintest idea
what it means to be a great lady.Of course you know why
he's marrying you, don't you?You haven't flattered yourself
that he's in love with you?Fact is, that empty house got on
his nerves to such an extent,he nearly went off his head.He just couldn't go on living alone.You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.
You'll miss your train.Mrs. De Winter.Goodbye, my dear, and good luck!Monsieur!What is he saying?He says I've forgotten
the proof that we're married.Good heavens.Somebody else had the same idea.- Isn't she sweet?
- Yes.You'd have liked a bridal veil,
wouldn't you?Or at least...Oh, Maxim, how lovely.How perfectly lovely.Perfectly lovely.Welcome home, Mr. De Winter.
Thank you, Smith.- Cold, darling?
- Yes, just a little bit.There's no need to be frightened,
you know.Just be yourself,
and they'll all adore you.You don't have to worry
about the house at all.Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper.
Just leave it to her.Hello. It's starting to rain.
We'd better hurry up.Here. Have this. Put it over your head.Thank you.That's it. That's Manderley.- Here we are. Frith, everybody well?
- Yes, thank you, sir.Glad to see you home, sir.- This is Mrs. De Winter, Frith.
- How do you do?I didn't expect the whole staff
to be in attendance.Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.Oh. Sorry about this.
It won't take long.This is Mrs. Danvers.How do you do?I have everything in readiness for you.That's very good of you. I...
I didn't expect anything.- I think we'd like some tea, Frith.
- Ready in the library, sir.Come along, darling.Oh, Maxim, come in.Oh.- Good evening, Mrs. Danvers.
- Good evening, madam.- I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.
- Oh, yes, thank you, perfectly.She's the parlor maid.She'll have to look after you
until your own maid arrives.Oh, but I haven't a maid.
I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.I'm afraid that would not do
for very long, madam.It's usual for ladies in your position
to have a personal maid.I hope you approve the new decoration
of these rooms, madam?Oh, I didn't know it had been changed.I hope you haven't been
to too much trouble.I only followed out
Mr. De Winter's instructions.Well, what did it look like before?It had an old paper
and different hangings.It was never used much
except for occasional visitors.Oh. Then it wasn't
Mr. De Winter's room originally?No, madam.
He's never used the east wing before.Of course, there's no view
of the sea from here.The only good view of the sea
is from the west wing.The room's very charming,
and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.If there's anything you want done,
madam, you have only to tell me.I suppose you've been at Manderley
for many years, longer than anyone else.Not so long as Frith.He was here when the old gentleman
was living,when Mr. De Winter was a boy.Oh, I see.
And you didn't come till after that?I came here when the first
Mrs. De Winter was a bride.Mrs. Danvers,
I do hope we'll be friends.You must be patient with me.This sort of life is new to me
and I do want to make a success of it,and make Mr. De Winter happy,so I know I can leave
all the household arrangements to you.Very well. I hope I shall do everything
to your satisfaction, madam.I've managed the house
since Mrs. De Winter's deathand Mr. De Winter has never complained.I think I'll go downstairs now.That room in the west wing I was telling
you about is there, through that door.It's not used now.It's the most beautiful room
in the house,the only one that looks down
across the lawns to the sea.It was Mrs. De Winter's room.- Good morning.
- Good morning.- You're Mrs. De Winter, aren't you?
- Yes.My name's Crawley.
I manage the estate for Maxim.Awfully glad to meet you.A fearful lot of stuff piled up
while Maxim was away.Yes, I'm sure there must have been.
I do wish I could help with some of it.No, no! Frank never allows anybody
to help him.He's like an old mother hen
with his bills and rents and taxes.Come on, Frank,
we must go over these estimates.I'll get my papers.You'll find quantities
of breakfast over there.But you must eat it all,
or Cook will be mortally offended.I'll do my best, Maxim.I have to go over the place
with Frank,just to make sure that he
hasn't lost any of it.You'll be all right, won't you?
Getting acquainted with your new home?Have a look at The Times.
There's a thrilling articleon what's the matter
with English cricket.Oh, yes...My sister, Beatrice,
and her husband, Giles Lacy,have invited themselves over for lunch.- Today?
- Yes.I suppose the old girl
can't wait to look you over.You'll find her very direct.If she doesn't like you, she'll
probably tell you so to your face.Don't worry, darling, I'll be back
in time to protect you from her.- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Maxim.- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Frith.Isn't there anything
I could get for you, madam?No, thank you, Frith.
I'm really not very hungry.Thank you.- The paper, madam.
- Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.I slipped.Thank you, Frith.- It's big, isn't it?
- Yes, madam, Manderley is a big place.This was the banquet hall
in the old days.It's still used on great occasions,
such as a big dinner or a ball.And the public is admitted here,
you know, once a week.That's nice.I beg pardon, madam.I'm afraid the fire is not usually lit
in the library until the afternoon.But you'll find one in the morning room.Of course, if you wish
this fire lit now, madam...No, Frith, I wouldn't dream of it.Mrs. De Winter...I mean, the late Mrs. De Winteralways did her correspondence
and telephoning in the morning room,after breakfast.Thank you, Frith.Is anything wrong, madam?Oh, no. Which way is the morning room?Oh, it's that door there, on the left.Oh, yes, thank you.Mrs. De Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.Mrs. De Winter's been dead
for over a year.Oh, I mean...Oh.That was the house telephone, madam.Probably the head gardener
wishing instructions.Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?Mr. De Winter informed me that
his sister, Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacyare expected for luncheon.I'd like to know
if you approve of the menu.Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable,
very nice indeed.You will notice, madam, that I've
left a blank space for the sauce.Mrs. De Winter was most particular
about sauces.Let's have whatever you think
that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered.Thank you, madam.When you've finished your letters,
Robert will take them to the post.My... My letters?Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.How are you, Frith?
- Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.Where's Mr. De Winter?I believe he went down
to the farm with Mr. Crawley.How tiresome of him not to
be here when we arrive, and how typical.I must say old Danvers
keeps the house looking lovely.She's certainly learned that trick
of arranging flowers from Rebecca.I wonder how she likes it now,being ordered about
by an ex-chorus girl.Now, where on Earth
did you get the ideashe's an ex-chorus girl?He picked her up in the South of France,
didn't he?What if he did?Well, I mean to say, there you are.How do you do? I'm Maxim's wife.How do you do?Well, I must say you're quite different
from what I expected.Don't be so silly.
She's exactly what I told you she'd be.Well, how do you like Manderley?It's very beautiful, isn't it?And how do you get along
with Mrs. Danvers?Well, I...I've never met anyone
quite like her before.You mean, she scares you.She's not exactly an oil painting,
is she?Giles, you're very much in the way here.
Go somewhere else.Well, I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?Giles.I didn't mean to say anything
against Mrs. Danvers.Oh, there's no need for you
to be frightened of her,but I shouldn't have any more
to do with her than you can help.- Shall we sit down?
- Yes. Yes, please.You see, she's bound to be
insanely jealous at firstand she must resent you bitterly.But why should she?Don't you know?I should have thought
Maxim would have told you.She simply adored Rebecca.- How are you, Robert?
- Quite well, thank you, madam.- Still having trouble with your teeth?
- Unfortunately, yes, madam.You must have them out, all of them.- Wretched nuisances, teeth.
- Thank you, madam.What a plateful.Do you hunt?No, I don't.
I'm afraid I don't even ride.You have to ride down here, we all do.Which do you ride,
sidesaddle or astride?Well, of course, I forgot.
You don't, do you?You must.
Nothing else to do around here.Maxim, when are you going to have
parties here again, like the old days?I haven't thought about it.- But everyone's dying to see you and...
- Yes, I bet they are.Why don't you have
the masquerade ball again this summer?My dear, are you fond of dancing?I love it, but I'm not very good at it.Do you rumba?- Never tried.
- You must teach me.Actually, I'm trying to find out
exactly what your wife does do.She sketches a little.Sketches.Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know,
portrait of a lampshade upside downto represent a soul in torment.Don't sail, do you?No, I don't.Thank goodness for that.Huh?You're very much in love with Maxim,
aren't you?Yes, I can see you are.Don't mind my saying so, but why
don't you do something about your hair?Why don't you have it cut
or sweep it back behind your ears?Oh, no, that's worse.What does Maxim say about it?
Does he like it like that?Well, he never mentions it.Oh, well, don't go by me.I can see by the way you dress
you don't care a hoot how you look.But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you.
He's so particular about clothes.I don't think he ever notices
what I wear.Oh. He must have changed a lot, then.You mustn't worry
about old Maxim and his moods.One never knows what goes on
in that quiet mind of his.Often, he gets into a terrible rage,
and when he does...I don't suppose he'll
lose his temper with you.You seem such a placid little thing.Come on, old girl. We've got to go
on the first tee at 3:00.All right, I'm coming.Well, goodbye, Maxim, old boy.Goodbye, Giles.
Thanks for coming, old boy.Goodbye, my dear. Forgive me for asking
you so many rude questions.We both really hope
you'll be very happy.Thank you, Beatrice,
thank you very much.And I must congratulate you
upon the way Maxim looks.We were very worried about him
this time last year.But then, of course,
you know the whole story.Goodbye, Beatrice.
- Goodbye, old boy.- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.Well, thank heavens they've gone.Now we can have a walk about the place.Looks as though we might have a shower.
But you won't mind that, will you?No, but wait a minute.
I'll go upstairs and get a coat.There's a heap of mackintoshes
in the flower room. Robert?Run and get a coat from the flower room
for Mrs. De Winter, will you?What do you think of Beatrice?Oh, I liked her very much,
but she kept sayingthat I was quite different
from what she expected.What the devil did she expect?Oh, someone smarter
and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.Do you like my hair?Your hair? Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it?Oh, I don't know. I just wondered.How funny you are.Thank you.- Do I have to put it on?
- Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly.You can't be too careful with children.Come on, Jasper.
Come and take some of that fat off.Jasper! Here. Not that way! Come here!Where does that lead to?Oh, it leads to a little cove
where we used to keep a boat.Oh, let's go down there.Well, no. It's a perfectly dull,
uninteresting stretch of sand,- just like any other.
- Oh, please.Well, all right. We'll walk down
and take a look if you really want to.That's Jasper.
There must be something wrong.- Perhaps he's hurt himself.
- No, he's all right, leave him alone.Don't you think I'd better go and see?Don't bother about him, I tell you,
he can't come to any harm.He'll find his own way back!Jasper! Jasper?Oh, there you are.What do you want in there, Jasper?
Come on. Come on home. Let's go home.Jasper...Oh.I didn't know that there was anybody...I know that dog.He comes from the house.He ain't yours.No. He's Mr. De Winter's dog.Have you anything I could tie him with?Come on, Jasper.You won't tell anyone
you saw me in there, will you?Don't you belong on the estate?I weren't doing nothing.I was just putting me shells away.She's gone in the sea, ain't she?She'll never come back no more.No. She'll never come back.Come on, Jasper.Maxim! What's the matter?Maxim!I'm sorry I was such a time,
but I had to find a rope for Jasper.Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.Please wait for me. Maxim, what is it?
You look so angry.You knew I didn't want you to go there,
but you deliberately went.Why not? There was only a cottage
down there and a strange man who...- You didn't go in the cottage, did you?
- Yes, the door was...- Don't go there again, do you hear?
- Well, why not?Because I hate the place.
And if you had my memories,you wouldn't go there or talk about it
or even think about it.What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry, please.We should have stayed away.We should never have come back
to Manderley.Oh, what a fool I was.I've made you unhappy.
Somehow, I've hurt you.Oh, I can't bear to see you like thisbecause I love you so much.Do you?I've made you cry.Forgive me.I sometimes seem to fly off the handle
for no reason at all.Don't I?Come, we'll go home and have some tea
and forget all about it.Yes, let's forget all about it.Here, let me have Jasper.- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.I was just wondering
if you meant what you said the other day- about showing me the run of things.
- Of course I did.What are you doing now?Notifying all the tenantsthat in celebration of Maxim's return
with his bride,this week's rent will be free.Oh, is that Maxim's idea?Oh, yes, all the servants get
an extra week's wages, too.Oh, he didn't tell me.Can't I help you?
I could at least lick the stamps.Well, that's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down?Yes, thank you.I was down at the cottage on the beach
the other day.There was a man there,
a queer sort of person.Jasper kept barking at him.Oh, yes, it must have been Ben.Excuse me. He's quite harmless.We give him odd jobs now and then.That cottage bay
seemed to be going to rack and ruin.Why isn't something done about it?I think if Maxim wanted anything
done about it, he'd tell me.Are those all Rebecca's things
down there?Yes.Yes, they are.What did she use the cottage for?The boat used to be moored near there.What boat? What happened to it?Was that the boat she was sailing in
when she was drowned?Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.Wasn't she afraid to go out
like that alone?She wasn't afraid of anything.Where did they find her?Near Edgecombe,about 40 miles up channel
about two months afterwards.Maxim went up to identify her.It was horrible for him.Yes, it must have been.Mr. Crawley, please don't think me
morbidly curious. It isn't that. It's...It's just that I feel
at such a disadvantage.All the time, whenever I meet anyone,
Maxim's sister or even the servants,I know they're all thinking
the same thing,that they're all comparing me with her,
with Rebecca.You mustn't think that.I can't tell you how glad I am
that you married Maxim.It's going to make
all the difference to his life.From my point of view,
it's very refreshingto find someone like yourself,who's not entirely in tune,
shall we say, with Manderley.That's very sweet of you.I daresay I've been stupid,but every day I realize
the things she had that I lack.Beauty and wit and intelligence,and all the things
that are so important in a woman.You have qualities
that are just as important,more important, if I may say so.Kindliness and sincerity,and if you'll forgive me, modesty,mean more to a husband than all
the wit and beauty in the world.We, none of us want to live in the past,Maxim least of all.It's up to you, you know,
to lead us away from it.Right.I promise you I won't
bring this up again,but before we end this conversation,would you answer
just one more question?If it's something I'm able to answer,
I'll do my best.Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?I suppose...I suppose she was the most
beautiful creature I ever saw.Good evening, Maxim.Hello. The films of the honeymoon
have arrived at last.Do we have time, do you think,
before dinner?What on Earth have you done to yourself?Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress
from London.I hope you don't mind.Oh, no, no. Only, do you think
that sort of thing's right for you?- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.And what have you done to your hair?Oh, I see.Dear, oh, dear. I'm sorry.You look lovely, lovely.It's very nice, for a change.- Shall we see these pictures?
- Yes. I'd love to see them.Look now, look at that.Wasn't it wonderful, darling?https://t.me/RickyChannelCan't we go back there someday?Yes, of course. Of course.
Look at you.Won't our grandchildren be delighted
when they see how lovely you were?Oh, look at you.Oh, I like that.Look at that.Yes, very nice.- Remember that?
Yes.I wish our honeymoon could have
lasted forever, Maxim.Dash it, look.Hang it.I've threaded it up wrong as usual
or something.Yes, Frith. What is it?Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you?Yes. Come in.It's about Robert, sir.There's been a slight unpleasantness
between him and Mrs. Danvers.Oh, dear.- Robert is very upset.
- This is trouble.What is it?It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused
Robert of stealing a valuable ornamentfrom the morning room.Robert denies the accusation
most emphatically, sir.- What was the thing, anyway?
- China cupid, sir.Oh, dear.
That's one of our treasures, isn't it?Well, tell Mrs. Danvers
to get to the bottom of it somehow.- Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.
- Very good, sir.Why do they come to me with these
things? That's your job, sweetheart.Maxim, I wanted to tell you,
but I forgot.The fact is, I broke the china cupid.You broke it?Now, why on Earth didn't you say
something about it when Frith was here?I don't know. I didn't like to.I was afraid he'd think me a fool.He'll think you much more
of a fool now.You'll have to explain to him
and Mrs. Danvers.Oh, no, Maxim.
You do it. I'll go upstairs.Don't be such a little idiot, darling.Anybody would think
you were afraid of them.It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.Apparently, Mrs. De Winter
broke the cupid herselfand forgot to say anything about it.I'm so sorry. I never thought
that I'd get Robert into trouble.Is it possible to repair
the ornament, madam?No, I'm afraid it isn't.
It smashed into pieces.What did you do with the pieces?Well, I put them at the back of one
of the drawers in the writing desk.Well, it looks as though
Mrs. De Winter was afraidyou were going to put her in prison,
doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?Well, never mind.
Do what you can to find the pieces.See if they can be mended, and
above all, tell Robert to dry his tears.I shall apologize to Robert, of course.
Perhaps if such a thing happens again,Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally.Yes, yes, all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.Well, I suppose that clip
will hold all right. I don't know.I'm awfully sorry,
darling. It was very careless of me.- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me.
- Hang Mrs. Danvers.Why on Earth
should you be frightened of her?You behave more like an upstairs maid
or something,- not the mistress of the house at all.
- Yes, I know I do.But I feel so uncomfortable.I try my best every day, but it's very
difficult with people looking meup and down as if I were a prize cow.What does it matter if they do?
You must rememberthat life at Manderley is the only thing
that interests anybody down here.What a slap in the eye
I must have been to them, then.I suppose that's why you married me,because you knew I was dull and gauche
and inexperienced,and there'd never be
any gossip about me.Gossip? What do you mean?I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.Don't look at me like that. Maxim.What's the matter? What have I said?Wasn't a very attractive thing
to say, was it?No. It was rude, hateful.I wonder if I did a very selfish thing
in marrying you.How do you mean?I'm not much of a companion
to you, am I?You don't get much fun, do you?You ought to have married a boy,
someone of your own age.Maxim, why do you say this?
Of course we're companions.Are we? I don't know.- I'm very difficult to live with.
- No, you're not difficult.You're easy, very easy.Our marriage is a success,
isn't it, a great success?We're happy, aren't we? Terribly happy?If you don't think we are happy,it would be much better
if you didn't pretend.I'll go away.Why don't you answer me?How can I answer youwhen I don't know the answer myself?If you say we're happy,
let's leave it at that.Happiness is something
I know nothing about.Oh, look. There's the one
when I left the camerarunning on the tripod, remember?Pardon me, madam.
Is there anything I can do for you?I'm all right, Hilda.
Thank you very much.I'll bring the sandwiches
immediately, madam.- Hilda.
- Yes, madam?The west wing.
Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. De Winter.Come along, Mr. Jack,
or someone may see you.Well, Danny, old harpy,
it's been good to see you again.I've been simply breathless
to pick up all the news.I really don't think it's
wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.Jasper, come here.Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
It's just like coming back home.Quiet, Mr. Jack.Yes. We must be careful
not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we?She's in the morning room.If you leave through the garden door,
she won't see you.I must say,
I feel a little like the poor relation,sneaking around through back doors.Well, toodle-oo, Danny.Goodbye, Mr. Jack,
and please be careful.Jasper, be quiet.Looking for me?- I didn't make you jump, did I?
- No.Of course not.
I didn't quite know who it was.Yes. You're pleased to see me,
aren't you, old boy?I'm glad there's someone in the family
to welcome me back to Manderley.And how is dear old Max?Very well, thank you.I hear he went up to London,
left his little bride all alone.It's too bad.Isn't he rather afraid that somebody
might come down and carry you off?Danny, all your precautions
were in vain.The mistress of the house
was hiding behind the door.Oh. What about presenting me
to the bride?This is Mr. Favell, madam.How do you do?- Won't you have some tea or something?
- Now, isn't that a charming invitation?I've been asked to tea, Danny,
and I've a good mind to accept.Oh, well, perhaps you're right. Pity,
just when we were getting on so nicely.We mustn't lead the young bride astray,
must we, Jasper?Goodbye. It's been fun meeting you.Oh, and by the way, it would be
very decent of you if you didn't mentionthis little visit
to your revered husband.He doesn't exactly approve of me.- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.I wish I had a young bride of
three months waiting for me at home.I'm just a lonely old bachelor.Fare thee well.Oh, and I know what was wrong
with that introduction.Danny didn't tell you, did she?I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.Toodle-oo!Do you wish anything, madam?I didn't expect to see you,
Mrs. Danvers.I noticed that a window wasn't closed
and I came up to see- if I could fasten it.
- Why did you say that?I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?You've always wanted to see this room,
haven't you, madam?Why did you never ask me
to show it to you?I was ready to show it to you every day.It's a lovely room, isn't it?Loveliest room you've ever seen.Everything is kept
just as Mrs. De Winter liked it.Nothing has been altered
since that last night.Come. I'll show you her dressing room.This is where I keep all her clothes.You would like to see them,
wouldn't you?Feel this.It was a Christmas present
from Mr. De Winter.He was always giving her expensive
gifts, the whole year round.I keep her underwear on this side.They were made specially for her by
the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.I always used to wait up for her,
no matter how late.Sometimes she and Mr. De Winter
didn't come home until dawn.While she was undressing, she'd tell me
about the party she'd been to.She knew everyone that mattered.Everyone loved her.When she finished her bath,she'd go into the bedroom
and go over to the dressing table.Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you?
There. That's better.Just as she always laid it down.""Come on, Danny. Hair drill, ""
she would say.And I'd stand behind her like this
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.And then she would say,
""Good night, Danny, ""and step into her bed.I embroidered this case for her myself,
and I keep it here always.Did you ever see anything so delicate?Look. You can see my hand through it.You wouldn't think she'd been gone
so long, would you?Sometimes when I walk along
the corridor,I fancy I hear her just behind me.That quick light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.Not only in this room,
it's in all the rooms in the house.I can almost hear it now.Do you think the dead come back
and watch the living?No, I don't believe it.Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't
come back here to Manderley,and watch you
and Mr. De Winter together.You look tired.Why don't you stay here
a while and rest?And listen to the sea.So soothing.Listen to it.Listen.Listen to the sea.Tell Mrs. Danvers
I wish to see her immediately.You sent for me, madam?Yes, Mrs. Danvers.I want you to get rid
of all these things.- These are Mrs. De Winter's things.
- I am Mrs. De Winter now.Very well. I'll give the instructions.Just a moment, please.Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing
to Mr. De Winterabout Mr. Favell's visit.In fact, I prefer to forget
everything that happened this afternoon.Maxim, Maxim, you've been gone all day.You're choking me.Well, well, well, what have
you been doing with yourself?- I've been thinking.
- What did you want to do that for?Come in here and I'll tell you.Darling, could we have a costume ball
just as you used to?Now what put that into your mind?Has Beatrice been at you?No, no, but I feel
that we ought to do somethingto make people feel that Manderley
is just the same as it always was.Oh, please, darling, could we?You don't know what it would mean,
you know.You'd have to be hostess
to hundreds of people, all the county.And a lot of young people
would come up from London,- and turn the house into a nightclub.
- Oh, yes. But I want to. Please.I've never been to a large party,
but I could learn what to do.And I promise you,
you wouldn't be ashamed of me.All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.You'd better get Mrs. Danvers
to help you out, won't you?No, no. I don't need Mrs. Danvers
to help me. I can do it myself.All right, my sweet.Thank you, darling. Thank you.- What'll you go as?
- I never dress up.That's the one privilege I claim
as the host.What will you be? Alice in Wonderland,
with that ribbon around your hair?No, I won't tell you.I'll design a costume all by myself
and give you the surprise of your life.Come in.Robert found these sketches
in the library, madam.- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.They were just some ideas I was
sketching for my costume for the ball.Hasn't Mr. De Winter suggested anything?No, I want to surprise him. I don't want
him to know anything about it.I merely thought
that you might find a costumeamong the family portraits
that would suit you.Oh, you mean those at the top
of the stairs? I'll go and look at them.This one, for instance.
Might have been designed for you.I'm sure you could have it copied.I've heard Mr. De Winter say that this
is his favorite of all the paintings.It's Lady Caroline de Winter,
one of his ancestors.Oh, well, that's a splendid idea,
Mrs. Danvers. I'm very grateful.- Everything under control, Frith?
- Yes, sir, thank you.Excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be
a schoolmaster?Oh, no. This is just
my old cap and gown.It certainly makes a very nice costume,
sir. And economical, too.Yes. That was the idea.Good evening, Robert.
Not very good weather for the ball.- No, sir.
- Very misty on the way and very chilly.Oh, this wig's so tight
they ought to send an aspirin with it.Hello. What's the idea? Adam and Eve?Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.- Strongman. Where's my weight thing?
- What thing?You haven't left it in the car,
have you?There it is.- You were the first one down?
- Yes.Where's the child?Well, she's keeping her costume
a terrific secret.Wouldn't even let me into her room.Oh, lovely.I'll go up and give her a hand.- I could do with a drink.
- Won't you catch a cold in that thing?Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.- Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.
- Thank you.Here I am, dear, it's Bea.
I've come to give you a hand.Oh, please don't
come in, Beatrice.I don't want anyone to see my costume.Oh. Oh, you won't be long, will you?Because the first people
will be arriving any moment.Now, you're sure
that's where that should be?Yes, madam, it's just right.- Isn't it exciting?
- Indeed it is, madam.I've always heard of the Manderley ball,
and now I'm really going to see one.I'm sure there will be no one there
to touch you, madam.Do you really think so?
Now, where's my fan?Here.- You're sure I look all right?
- You look ever so beautiful.Well, here goes.Good evening, Mr. De Winter.What the devil do you think
you're doing?Rebecca.But it's the picture.
The one in the gallery.- What is it? What have I done?
- Go and take it off.It doesn't matter what you put on.
Anything will do.What are you standing there for?
Didn't you hear what I said?Sir George and Lady Moore.Dudley Tennant.
Admiral and Lady Burbank.I watched you go down,
just as I watched her a year ago.Even in the same dress,
you couldn't compare.You knew it.You knew that she wore it, and yet
you deliberately suggested I wear it.Why do you hate me? What have I done
to you that you should ever hate me so?You tried to take her place,
you let him marry you.I've seen his face, his eyes.They're the same as those first weeks
after she died.I used to listen to him walking
up and down, up and down,all night long, night after night,thinking of her, suffering torture
because he'd lost her.I don't want to know.
I don't want to know!You thought you could be Mrs. De Winter,
live in her house, walk in her steps,take the things that were hers.
But she's too strong for you.You can't fight her. No one ever
got the better of her. Never. Never.She was beaten in the end,
but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.It was the sea.Oh, stop it. Stop it. Oh, stop it.You're overwrought, madam.
I've opened a window for you.A little air will do you good.Why don't you go?
Why don't you leave Manderley?He doesn't need you.
He's got his memories.He doesn't love you.
He wants to be alone again with her.You've nothing to stay for.You've nothing to live for, really,
have you?Look down there. It's easy, isn't it?Why don't you? Why don't you?Go on.Don't be afraid.Shipwreck.
Ship on the rocks!- A ship aground, sending up rockets!
- Shipwreck!Come on, everybody,
down to the bay.Notify the coast guard.
She's aground.Maxim! Maxim!Ship ashore.
Come on! Come on, everybody.Come on! Come on!
- Maxim! Maxim!Oh!Ben, have you seen
Mr. De Winter anywhere?She won't come back, will she?
You said so.Who, Ben? What do you mean?The other one.- Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?
- Not since about half an hour ago.I thought he'd gone up to the house.No, he hasn't been in the house at all,and I'm afraid something
might have happened to him.Frank, what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?- There is something wrong.
- Well...The diver who went down to inspect
the bottom of the shipcame across the hull of another boat.
A little sailboat.- Frank, is it...
- Yes.It's Rebecca's.How did they recognize it?He's a local man. Knew it instantly.It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.Yes. It's going to bring it all
back again, and worse than before.Why did they have to find it?Why couldn't they have left it
there in peaceat the bottom of the sea?Well, I'd better get along and arrange
some breakfast for the men.All right, Frank.
I'll go and look for Maxim.- Hello.
- Maxim.You haven't had any sleep.- Have you forgiven me?
- Forgiven you?What have I got to forgive you for?For last night.
My stupidity about the costume.Oh, that.I'd forgotten.
I was angry with you, wasn't I?Hmm.Maxim, can't we start all over again?I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.I'll be your friend, your companion.
I'll be happy with that.You love me very much, don't you?But it's too late, my darling.We've lost our little chance
of happiness.- No, Maxim, no.
- Yes.It's all over now.The thing's happened.The thing I have dreaded day after day.- Night after night.
- Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?Rebecca has won.Her shadow has been between us all
the time, keeping us from one another.She knew that this would happen.What are you saying?They sent a diver down.- He found another boat.
- Yes, I know. Frank told me.Rebecca's boat. Oh, it's
terrible for you. I'm so sorry.The diver made another discovery.Broke one of the ports
and looked into the cabin.There was a body in there.She wasn't alone.
There was someone sailing with her,and you have to find out who it was,
that's it, isn't it, Maxim?You don't understand.
There was no one with her.It's Rebecca's body lying there
on the cabin floor.Oh, no.The woman that was washed up
at Edgecombe,the woman that is now buried
in the family crypt,that was not Rebecca.That was the body
of some unknown woman,unclaimed, belonging nowhere.I identified it.
But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.It was all a lie.I knew where Rebecca's body was,lying on that cabin floor
on the bottom of the sea.How did you know, Maxim?Because I put it there.Will you look into my eyes
and tell me that you love me now?You see? I was right.It's too late.No, it's not too late.
You're not to say that.I love you more than anything
in the world.- Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.
- No.It's no use. It's too late.Oh, we can't lose each other now.
We must be together always.No secrets, no shadows.We may only have a few days,
a few hours.Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?I nearly did sometimes,
but you never seemed close enough.How could we be close when I knew
you were always thinking of Rebecca?How could I even ask you to love me,
when I knew you loved Rebecca still?What are you talking about?What do you mean?Whenever you touched me, I knew
you were comparing me with Rebecca.Whenever you looked at me or spoke
to me or walked with me in the garden,I knew you were thinking, ""This I did
with Rebecca, and this, and this. ""Oh, it's true, isn't it?You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?I hated her.Oh, I was carried away by her,
enchanted by her as everyone was.And when I was married, I was told
I was the luckiest man in the world.She was so lovely, so accomplished,so amusing.""She's got the three things that really
matter in a wife, "" everyone said.""Breeding, brains and beauty. ""And I believed them. Completely.But I never had
a moment's happiness with her.She was incapable of loveor tendernessor decency.You didn't love her.
You didn't love her.Do you remember that cliff
where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?Well, I went there with Rebecca
on our honeymoon.That's where I found out about her,
four days after we were married.She stood there laughing,
her black hair blowing in the windand told me all about herself.
Everything.Things I'll never tell a living soul.I wanted to kill her.It would have been so easy.
You remember the precipice?I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.It wouldn't make for sanity, would it?
Living with the devil?""I'll make a bargain with you, ""
she said.""You'd look rather foolish
trying to divorce me nowafter four days of marriage,so I'll play the part
of a devoted wife,mistress of your precious Manderley.I'll make it the most famous showplace
in England, if you like,and people will visit us and envy us,and say we're the luckiest,
happiest couple in the country.What a grand joke it'll be.
What a triumph. ""I should never have accepted
her dirty bargain, but I did.I was younger then, and tremendously
conscious of the family honor.Family honor.She knew that I'd sacrifice everything
rather than stand up in a divorce courtand give her away, admit that
our marriage was a rotten fraud.You despise me, don't you?As I despise myself.You can't understand
what my feelings were,can you?Of course I can, darling.
Of course I can.Well, I kept the bargain
and so did she, apparently.Oh, she played the game brilliantly,but after a while,
she began to grow careless.She took a flat in London,
and she'd stay away for days at a time.Then she started
to bring her friends down here.I warned her,
but she shrugged her shoulders.""What's it got to do with you?""
She said.She even started on Frank.Poor, faithful Frank.Then there was a cousin of hers,
a man named Favell.Yes. I know him.
He came the day you went to London.Why didn't you tell me?I didn't like to.I thought it would
remind you of Rebecca.Remind me?As if I needed reminding.Favell used to visit her here
in this cottage.I found out about it, and I warned her
that if he came here again,I'd shoot them both.One night, when I found she had
come back quietly from London,I thought that Favell was with her,and I knew then
that I couldn't standthis life of filth and deceit
any longer.I decided to come down here
and have it out with both of them.But she was alone.She was expecting Favell,
but he hadn't come.She was lying on the divan, a large
tray of cigarette stubs beside her.She looked ill, queer.Suddenly, she got up,
started to walk toward me.""When I have a child, "" she said,
""neither you nor anyone elsecould ever prove it wasn't yours.You would like to have an heir,
wouldn't you, Max,for your precious Manderley?""Then she started to laugh.""How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.I'll be the perfect mother,
just as I've been the perfect wife.No one will ever know.It ought to give you
the thrill of your life, Max,to watch my son grow bigger day by dayand to know that when you die,
Manderley will be his. ""She was face to face with me.One hand in her pocket,
the other holding a cigarette.She was smiling.""Well, Max?What are you going to do about it?Aren't you going to kill me?""I suppose I went mad for a moment.I must have struck her.She stood staring at me.She looked almost triumphant.Then she started toward me again.
Smiling.Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.When I looked down,ages afterwards, it seemed,
she was lying on the floor.She had struck her head
on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.I remember wondering
why she was still smiling.Then I realized she was dead.But you didn't kill her.
It was an accident.Who would believe me?I lost my head.I just knew I had to do something.
Anything.I carried her out to the boat.It was very dark. There was no moon.I put her in the cabin.When the boat seemed a safe distance
from the shore, I took a spike,and drove it again and again
through the planking of the hull.I had opened up the seacocks
and the water began to come in fast.I climbed over into the dinghy
and pulled away.I saw the boat heel overand sink.I pulled back into the cove.It started raining.- Maxim, does anyone else know of this?
- No. No one except you and me.We must explain it.It's got to be the body of someone
you've never seen before.No, they're bound to know her.
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.They'll identify her body,
then they'll remember the other woman.The other woman buried in the crypt.If they find out it was Rebecca,you must simply say you made a mistake
about the other body.That the day you went to Edgecombe,
you were ill,you didn't know what you were doing.Rebecca's dead. That's what
we've got to remember. Rebecca's dead.She can't speak. She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.We're the only two people in the world
that know, Maxim, you and I.I'd told you once that I'd done
a selfish thing in marrying you.You can understand now what I meant.I've loved you, my darling.I shall always love you,but I've known all alongthat Rebecca would win in the end.No, no. She hasn't won.No matter what happens now,
she hasn't won.Hello?Hello, Frank.Hello, Frank. Yes.Who? Colonel Julyan?Yes. Tell him I'll meet him there
as soon as I possibly can.What?Well...Say we could talk about that
when we're sure about the matter.What's happened?Colonel Julyan called.He's the chief constable of the county.He's been asked by the police
to go to the mortuary.He wanted to know if I could possibly
have made a mistakeabout that other body.Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did
make a mistake about that other body.The mistake was natural
under the circumstances.- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.Don't let it worry you, Maxim. Nobody
can blame you for making a mistake.The pity is, you've got to go through
the same thing all over again.What do you mean?There'll have to be another inquest,
of course. Same formality and red tape.Wish you could be spared the publicity
of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.Oh, yes, publicity.I suppose Mrs. De Winter went below
for something and a squall hit the boatwith nobody at the helm.I imagine that's about the solution now,
don't you think so, Crawley?Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed,
and she couldn't get on deck again.Yeah.Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly
come to some such conclusion.Why, what would he know about it?Well, he's examining the boat now.
Purely as a matter of routine, you know.I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim,
quite unofficially, you know.We must get together for a game
of golf when it's all over, eh?Bye-bye.I have the evening papers, madam.
Would you care to see them?Oh, no thank you, Frith,and I prefer that Mr. De Winter
weren't troubled with them, either.I understand, madam. Permit me to say
that we're all most distressed outside.Thank you, Frith.I'm afraid the news has been
a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.Yes, I rather expected it would be.It seems there's to be
a coroner's inquest, madam?Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.Of course, madam. I...I wanted to say that if any of us
might be required to give evidence,I should be only too pleased to do
anything that might help the family.Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I...I'm sure Mr. De Winter
will be very happy to hear it.But I don't think
anything will be necessary.Maxim.Hello, darling.Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about
what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.What do you mean?You won't lose your temper, will you?Promise me
that they won't make you angry.All right, darling. I promise.No matter what he asks you,
you won't lose your head?Don't worry, dear.They can't do anything at once,
can they?No.Then we've a little time left
to be together.Yes.- I want to go to the inquest with you.
- I'd rather you didn't, darling.But I can't wait here alone.I promise you,
I won't be any trouble to you.And I must be near you
so that no matter what happens,we won't be separated for a moment.All right, dear.I don't mind this whole thing
except for you.I can't forget what it's done to you.I've been thinking of nothing else
since it happened.It's gone forever,that funny, young, lost look I loved.It won't ever come back.I killed that
when I told you about Rebecca.It's gone.In a few hours,
you've grown so much older.Oh, Maxim, Maxim.Black Jack Brady was his name.The most important arrest I ever made.It must have been
about two years ago now.Of course, there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him.Hello. Wait a minute.They've got old Balmy Ben up now.You remember
the late Mrs. De Winter, don't you?- She's gone.
- Yes, we know that.- She went in the sea. The sea got her.
- That's right. That's right.Now we want you to tell us
whether you were on the shore- that last night she went sailing.
- Eh?Were you on the shore that last night
she went out, when she didn't come back?I didn't see nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.Them cruel folks there.Now, nobody's going to send you
to the asylum.All we want you to do
is tell us what you saw.I didn't see nothing.Come, come.Did you see Mrs. De Winter
get into her boat that last night?I don't know nothing.I don't want to go to the asylum.Very well. You may go.- Eh?
- You may go now.- Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.
- Yes?The evidence you give
will be the truth, the whole truthand nothing but the truth,
so help you God?I do, so help me God.The late Mrs. De Winter
used to send her boat- to your shipyard for reconditioning.
- That's right, sir.Can you remember any occasionwhen she had any sort of accident
with the boat?No, sir. I often said
Mrs. De Winter was a born sailor.Now, when Mrs. De Winter
went below, as is supposed,and a sudden gust of wind came down,that would be enough to capsize
the boat, wouldn't it?Excuse me, sir. But there's
a little more to it than that.- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
- I mean, sir, the seacocks.What are the seacocks?Sea...The seacocks are the valves
to drain out the boat.They're always kept tight closed
when you're afloat.Yes?Well, yesterday, when I examined
that boat, I found they'd been opened.What could be the reason for that?Just this, that's what flooded the boat
and sunk her.Are you implying
that boat never capsized at all?I know it's a terrible thing to say,
sir, but in my opinion,she was scuttled.- And there's them holes.
- What holes?- In her planking.
- What are you talking about?Of course, that boat's been underwater
for over a year,and the tide's been knocking her
against the ridge.But it seemed to me them holes looked
as if she'd made them from the inside.Then you believe
she must have done it deliberately.Couldn't have been no accident,
not with her knowledge of boats.You knew the former Mrs. De Winter
very well, I believe?Oh, yes.Would you have believed her
capable of suicide?No. Frankly, I would not.
But you never can tell.You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.Mr. De Winter, please.Sorry to drag you back
for further questioning, Mr. De Winter.But you've heard
the statement of Mr. Tabb.I wonder if you can help us in any way.I'm afraid not.Can you think of any reason
why there should be holesin the planking
of the late Mrs. De Winter's boat?Well, of course
I can't think of any reason.Has anyone ever discussed
these holes with you before?Well, since the boat has been
at the bottom of the ocean,I scarcely think that likely.Mr. De Winter, I want you
to believe we all feel very deeplyfor you in this matter.But you must remember
that I don't conduct this inquiryfor my own amusement.- That's rather obvious, isn't it?
- I hope that it is.Well, since she went sailing alone,are we to believe
that she drove those holes herself?You may believe what you like.Can you enlighten us as to
why Mrs. De Winter should have wantedto end her own life?I know of no reason whatever.Mr. De Winter,
however painful it may be,I have to ask you
a very personal question.Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy?I won't stand this any longer!
You might as well know now...We'll adjourn till after lunch.Mr. De Winter, I presume
you'll be available for us then?I told you,
you should have had some breakfast.You're hungry.
That's what's the matter with you.Mr. Frith thought you might
like to have some lunch from the house,and sent me with it.No, that's fine.
Pull around the corner.Very good, sir.Awfully foolish of me,
fainting like that.Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted like
that, I'd have really lost my temper.Darling, please be careful.Darling, wait here a few moments.
I'll see if I can find old Frank.Of course, darling.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.Sure?Here, try a spot of this. Do you good.Thank you.- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course.- I won't be long.
- Right you are.Hello.And how does the bride
find herself today?I say, marriage with Max
is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?I think you'd better go
before Maxim gets back.Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.But you don't think I'm
the big bad wolf, do you?I'm not, you know. I'm a perfectly
ordinary, harmless bloke.And I think you're behaving splendidly
over all this. Perfectly splendidly.You know, you've grown up a bit
since I last saw you. It's no wonder...What do you want, Favell?Oh, hello, Max. Things are going
pretty well for you, aren't they?Better than you ever expected.I was rather worried about you at first.
That's why I came down to the inquest.Well, I'm touched by your solicitude.But if you don't mind,
we'd rather like to have our lunch.Lunch? I say, what a jolly idea.
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?I'm so sorry.
Do you mind if I put this there?You know, Max, old boy, I really think
I ought to talk things over with you.Talk what things over?Well, those holes in the planking,
for one thing.Those holes
that were drilled from the inside.- Oh, Mullen?
- Yes, sir?Would you, like a good fellow,
have my car filled with petrol?- It's almost empty.
- Very good, sir.- And, Mullen, close the door, will you?
- Yes, sir.Does this bother you?You know, old boy, I have a strong
feeling that before the day's out,somebody's going to make use
of that rather expressive,though somewhat old-fashioned term,
""foul play. ""Am I boring you with all this?No?Good. Well, you see, Max, I find
myself in a rather awkward position.You've only got to read this note
to understand. It's from Rebecca.And, what's more, she had the foresight
to put a date on it.She wrote me the day she died.Incidentally, I was at a party
on that nightso I didn't get it until the next day.And what makes you think
that note would interest me?Oh, I'm not gonna bother you
with the contents now.But I can assure you
that it is not the note of a womanwho intends to drown herself
that same night.By the way, what do you do
with old bones? Bury them?However, for the time being...You know, Max, I'm getting fed up
with my job as a motorcar salesman.I don't know if you've
ever experienced the feelingof driving an expensive motorcar
which isn't your own?But it can be very, very exasperating.You know what I mean.
You want to own the car yourself.I often wonder what it would be like
to retire to the country.Have a nice little place
with a few acres of shooting.I've never figured out
what it would cost a year,but I'd like to talk about it with you.I'd like to have your advice on how
to live comfortably without hard work.Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?Yes.Mr. Favell and I have a little
business transaction on hand.I think we had better conduct it
over at the inn.They may have a private room there.Well, see you later.Find Colonel Julyan.
Tell him I want to see him immediately.Come on, Favell. Let's go.- Have you a private room, please?
- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.Hope this will do, Mr. De Winter.Splendid. Splendid.
Exactly like the Ritz.Any orders, gents?Yes. You might bring me
a large brandy and soda.How about you, Max? Have one on me.
I feel I can afford to play host.Thanks. I don't mind if I do.Make it two, will you,
like a good fellow?- Very good, sir.
Where's Mr. De Winter?Through the other door, sir.Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.Oh, I know Colonel Julyan.
We're old friends, aren't we?Since you're old friends,
I assume you also knowhe's head of the police here.He might be interested to hear your
proposition. Tell him all about it.I don't know what you mean. I merely
said I hoped to give up selling carsand retire into the country.Actually, he offered to withhold a vital
piece of evidence from the inquestif I made it worth his while.I only want to see justice done,
Colonel.Now, that boat builder's evidence
suggested certain possible theoriesconcerning Rebecca's death.
One of them, of course, is suicide.Now I have a little note here
which I considerputs that possibility
quite out of court.Read it, Colonel.""Jack, darling,I've just seen the doctor and I'm going
down to Manderley right away.I shall be at the cottage
all this eveningand shall leave
the door open for you.I have something terribly
important to tell you.Rebecca. ""Now, does that look
like the note of a womanwho had made up her mind
to kill herself?And apart from that,
do you mean to tell methat if you wanted to commit suicide,
you would go to all the troubleof putting out to sea in a boat,
and then take a hammer and chiseland laboriously knock holes
through the bottom of it?Come, Colonel. As an officer of the law,don't you feel there are some
slight grounds for suspicion?- Of murder?
- What else?You've known Max a long time. So
you know he's the old-fashioned type,who'd die to defend his honor,
or who'd kill for it.It's blackmail, pure and simple.Blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple.It can bring a lot of trouble
to a great many people.And the blackmailer sometimes
finds himself in jail at the end of it.Oh, I see. You're going to hold
de Winter's hand through all this.Just because
he's the big noise around hereand he's actually permitted you
to dine with him.Be careful, Favell.
You've brought an accusation of murder.- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.It's that fellow, Ben.If that stupid coroner hadn't been
as much of a snob as you are,he'd have seen
that half-wit was hiding something.And why should Ben do that?Because we caught him once,
Rebecca and I,peering at us through
the cottage window.Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.
That's why he was afraid to speak.But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.It's ridiculous,
even listening to all this.You're like a little trade union,
all of you, aren't you?And if my guess is right, Crawley,there's a bit of malice in your soul
toward me, isn't there?Crawley didn't have
much success with Rebecca,but he ought to have
more luck this time.And the bride will be grateful
for your fraternal arm, Crawley,in a week or so.
Every time she faints, in fact.- De Winter!
- Maxim, please!That temper of yours
will do you in yet, Max.Excuse me, gentlemen.- Now is there anything else?
- Yes.You might bring
Mr. De Winter a sedative.- No, no. Nothing at all. Just leave us.
- Very good.Now, Favell,
let's get this business over.https://t.me/RickyChannelAs you seem to have worked out
the whole thing so carefully,perhaps you can provide us
also with a motive.I knew you were going
to bring that up, Colonel.I've read enough detective stories to
know that there must always be a motive.And if you'll all excuse me,
I might supply that, too.I wish you'd go home. You ought
not to be here through all this.Please let me stay, Maxim.Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're
not going to allow this fellow to...My opinion of Favell
is no higher than yours, Crawley.But in my official capacity,
I have no alternativebut to pursue his accusations.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.In matters as serious as this,
we must make sure of every pointand explore every avenue.And in fact, if I may coin a phrase,
leave no stone unturned.Here she is, the missing link, the
witness who will help supply the motive.Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.
I believe you know everyone else.Won't you sit down?No offense, Colonel,
but I think I'll put this to Danny.She'll understand it more easily.Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?Mrs. De Winter always had Dr. McClean
from the village.Now, you heard.
I said Rebecca's doctor in London.I don't know anything about that.Oh, don't give me that, Danny.
You knew everything about Rebecca.You knew she was in love with me,
didn't you?Surely you haven't forgotten
the good times she and I used to havedown at the cottage on the beach.She had a right to amuse herself,
didn't she?Love was a game to her. Only a game.
It made her laugh, I tell you.She used to sit and rock with laughter
at the lot of you.Can you think of why Mrs. De Winter
should have taken her own life?No, no. I refuse to believe it.I knew everything about her
and I won't believe it.There. You see? It's impossible.
She knows that as well as I do.Now, listen to me, Danny.We know that Rebecca went
to a doctor in Londonon the last day of her life. Who was it?I don't know.I understand, Danny.You think we're asking you
to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.You're trying to defend her.
But that's what I'm doing.I'm trying to clear her name
of the suspicion of suicide.Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggestedthat Mrs. De Winter
was deliberately murdered.There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.But there's one more thing you'll want
to know, the name of the murderer.It's a lovely name
that rolls off the tongue so easily.George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.There was a doctor.Mrs. De Winter sometimes
went to him privately.She used to go to him
even before she was married.We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
What was his name?Dr. Baker.
165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll find your motive.Go and question Dr. Baker.
He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.To confirm the fact
that she was going to have a child.A sweet, curly-headed little child.It isn't true. It isn't true.
She would have told me.She told Max about it.
Max knew he wasn't the father.So, like the gentleman of the old school
that he is, he killed her.I'm afraid we shall
have to question this Dr. Baker.Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,
I think I'd like to go along, too.Yes. Unfortunately, I suppose
you have the right to ask that.I'll see the coroner
and have the inquest postponedpending further evidence.I say, aren't you rather afraid that
the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?You have my word for it
that he will not do that.Toodle-oo, Max. Come along, Danny.Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend
their last moments together alone.Are you sure you don't want me
to go with you, Max?No, darling.
It'll be very tiring for you.I'll be back the very first
thing in the morning.- And I won't even stop to sleep.
- I'll be waiting for you.- Ready, Maxim?
- Yes.You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.Dr. Baker, you may have seenMr. De Winter's name
in the papers recently.Yes. Yes. In connection
with the body that was found in a boat.My wife was reading all about it.
A very sad case. My condolences.This is going to take hours.
Let me...Don't bother, Favell.
I think I can tell Dr. Baker.We're trying to discover certain factsconcerning the late Mrs. De Winter's
activities on the day of her death.October the 12th, last year.I want you to tell me if you can,if anyone of that name
paid you a visit on that date?I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.I should have remembered
the name de Winter.I've never attended
a Mrs. De Winter in my life.How can you possibly tell
all your patients' names?I can look it up in my engagement diary
if you like.- Did you say the 12th of October?
Yes.Here we are.No. No de Winter.Are you sure?Well, here are all the appointments
for that day.Ross, Campbell, Steadall,
Perrino, Danvers...- Danny? What the devil?
- Would you read that name again?Did you say Danvers?Yes. I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.What did she look like?
Can you remember?Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman.- Tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.
Rebecca.The lady must have used
an assumed name.Is that so?This is a surprise.
I've known her a long time.What was the matter with her?Well, there are certain ethics.Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker,
for Mrs. De Winter's suicide?For her murder, you mean?She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?
Come on. Out with it!Tell me, what else would a woman of
her class be doing in a dump like this?I take it the official nature of this
visit makes it necessary for me to...I assure you we'd not be troubling you
if it were not necessary.You want to know
if I can suggest any motiveas to why Mrs. De Winter
should have taken her life?Yes, I think I can.The woman who called herself
Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.She was not going to have a child?That was what she thought.
My diagnosis was different.I sent her to a well-known specialist
for an examination and x-rays.And on this date,
she returned to me for his report.I remember her standing here
holding out her hand for the photograph.""I want to know the truth, "" she said.""I don't want soft words
and a bedside manner.If I'm for it,
you can tell me right away. ""I knew she was not the type
to accept a lie.She'd asked for the truth,
so I let her have it.She thanked me.
I never saw her again, so I assumed...- What was wrong with her?
- Cancer.Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.An operation would have been
no earthly use at all.In a short time,
she would have been under morphia.There was nothing that could be done
for her, except wait.Did she say anything
when you told her?She smiled
in a queer sort of way.Your wife was a wonderful woman,
Mr. De Winter.And, oh, yes, I remember
she said somethingthat struck me
as being very peculiar at the time.When I told her it was
a matter of months, she said,""Oh, no, Doctor, not that long. ""You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.We shall need
an official verification.- Verification?
- Yes.- To confirm the verdict of suicide.
I understand.Can I offer you gentlemen
a glass of sherry?No, that's very kind.
I think we ought to be going.Thank heaven we know the truth.Dreadful thing. Dreadful.Young and lovely woman like that.
No wonder...I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.I wish I had a drink.Will we be needed at the inquest
any further, Colonel Julyan?No, no. I can see to it
that Maxim's not troubled any further.- Thank you, sir.
- You ready to start, Colonel?No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.And let me tell you, Favell,
blackmail is not much of a profession.And we know how to deal with it
in our part of the world,strange as it may seem to you.I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.But if you ever need a new car, Colonel,
just let me know.It's impossible to thank you for
your kindness to us through all this.You know what I feel
without my saying it.Not at all.
Put the whole thing behind you.But let your wife know.
She'll be getting worried.Yes, of course.
I'll phone her at onceand we'll get straight down
to Manderley.Goodbye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?- There's something you don't know.
- Oh, no, there isn't.I didn't kill her, Frank.But I know now that when
she told me about the child,she wanted me to kill her.She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.That's why she stood there laughing
when she...Don't think about it anymore.Thank you, Frank.Hello, Danny.
I just wanted to tell you the news.Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.Yes, suicide.Now Max and that
dear little bride of hiswill be able to stay on at Manderley
and live happily ever after.Bye-bye, Danny.- This your car, sir?
- Yes.Will you be going soon?
This isn't a parking place, you know.Oh, isn't it? Well, people are entitled
to leave cars outside if they want to.It's a pity some of you fellows
haven't anything better to do.When you phoned,
did she say she'd wait up?I asked her to go to bed,
but she wouldn't hear of it.I wish I could get some more speed
out of this thing.Is something worrying you, Maxim?I can't get over the feeling
something's wrong.https://t.me/RickyChannel- Frank.
- What's the matter? Why did we stop?What's the time?Well, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?That can't be
the dawn breaking over there.It's in the winter that you see
the northern lights, isn't it?That's not the northern lights.
That's Manderley.Frith! Frith!Mrs. De Winter. Where is she?- I thought I saw her, sir.
- Where?Maxim!Thank heavens you've come back to me!- Are you all right, darling?
- Oh, yes, I am.Are you all right?Mrs. Danvers, she's gone mad.She said she'd rather destroy Manderley
than see us happy here.Look! The west wing!"

with direct access to the street.- If we're going to go, then we need to go now.
- Yeah, I'm in.- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.- I'm going outside.
- Why?To reason with them.Open the door!Open the fucking door!You said you wanted to see the world,
right, Tom?Let me in! Let me in!Burn it all. Come on.Get the safe, get the filing cabinets,
get it all.All four drawers,
I want them shredded right now.Not gonna shred fast enough.Grab the visa plates!All four! And anything else
you see out there.When in doubt, just shred it!We got 10 minutes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Everything!Get the shredder.There are no police.Jesus.Leave the building, go now.Iranians go first.Now, hurry!Who has made this?!It's done. They're in.Okay, come on.
We gotta get off the streets.This way. Up here to the left.{\an8}- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR{\an8}You think the Soviets would put up
with this shit? They'd invade.We helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.- How many were there?
- At least 50. We're not sure.- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?No, I was screaming his name
because I was fucking him.CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN{\an8}Come in.{\an8}It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.- I was told five.
- No, sir, apparently it's six.{\an8}- What happened?
- Not clear. We know they escaped.SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE{\an8}- Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador's house.- Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?
- Hold for the Secretary of State.Yes. Is White House joining?They claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.{\an8}- We wish it was.
- A fuckin' den of espionage.{\an8}Cl's got three people over there,
they don't see a revolution coming?WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE{\an8}- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.- Hodding.
- I'll call him back.They're sticking.
No release till we expel the shah.- Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.We took him in. He's ours now.Great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?No, just the pricks on our side.So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail......they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.What about the six
who are with the Canadians?We've got 60 in the embassy with guns
to their heads right now.The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.Banisadr's saying it'll be over
in 24 hours.We leave the six where they are.
I'll go brief the president.All right, let's get to it.So far official comments about
the incident have been a model of restraint.69 DAYS LATERIran's Revolutionary Guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists......blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been tightened.This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.In this country, George Meany died
last night. He was 85 years old.Yeah.Yes.What?WALLACE
To begin with, of course......we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the American embassy compound.They may not understand what
their ordeal means to their countrymen.But this nation, their nation, is outraged.{\an8}And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIAActions of Iran
have shocked the civilized world.Our embassy has been seized......and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.NBC's situation in Iran has changed,
however.- Is he back there?
- Office.What happened?The six of them went out a back exit.Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.Canadians took them in.Traffic calls them ""The Houseguests.""They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.What about the White House?Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.The Canadians are done.They say they're bearing too much risk. Their
foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels. .....and told him she wants
the six of them out.- Who else knows?
- Just the families.Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book. ..- ...on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.We think it got shredded
before they got in.But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.And they'll know what they look like.Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.State?- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.Engell says it's a lose-lose.These people die, they die badly. Publicly.State wants the blame, we'll give it to them.What does he want me here for?So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.Okay.This is Bob Pender from State O.S.He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.- Bob?
- Thank you.{\an8}All right.{\an8}Mark and Cora Lijek.Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular officer,
she's an assistant.Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.No language skills or in-country knowledge.{\an8}Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attachÃ© from Idaho.A bit of an oddball, apparently.He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.Joe Stafford. Late 20s.He's smart and a climber.Speaks Farsi.He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer......oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.So, what we like for this are bicycles.We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.A couple of rat lines
through the mountains.. ....to the crossing near Tabriz.Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.We wait till the weather clears up.. ....then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.Tony.It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.We were just asked to sharpshoot this.State is handling the op.I'm sorry, who is this?Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.Sir, if these people can read or add.. ....pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.It's winter. You can't afford to wait around till
spring so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them. .....you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four....visas for American journalists.The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.If they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.North American accents
gives us limited options.So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.What about English teachers
at the international school?It's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.Okay, so how about the do-gooders?Six Canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?Those kids are black.Those are African kids.- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?I'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so.. ..- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it ""Seeds of Hope.""Hold on.Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?What's in this picture?- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?- Snow.
- Right.So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?Sir, exfils are like abortions.You don't wanna need one.. ....but when you do, you don't do it yourself.You have a better plan?No, sir.REYNOLDS Whatever
the conflicting signals from Iran today......and for that matter, every day......about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies......the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:The hostages must be freed.--claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them.. ....it violates them for all nations.{\an8}We demand extradition...U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN{\an8}...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support......has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.He said if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages......the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.An Iranian flag was burned......when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.--also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians....They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.But I don't understand
what they should do now.Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?I don't think that justice is the worst thing.When did people first tell you that torture
was going on in Iran?They would never come to me and say,
""Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow.""President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam--Forgive me, his words, not mine.--a lunatic.Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?He would've been referred to as a barbarian.That's why they're saying
that their current regime....The shah did more for women's rights--I think you'd better--
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.At one point,
the mob cornered one of the Iranians.When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.Just hit him again!We're not gonna take it anymore!
We're sick of it!America!Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.I'm mad as hell.{\an8}I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in Network, you know? I've had it.And if need be, I'll bear arms again.And that's the way it is
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.- Hello?
- Buddy man.I'll get Mom.I'm looking for you.Did you do your homework tonight?- Yeah, it was easy.
- Excellent. What are we watching?Battle for the Planet of the Apes.Tell me, what channel is it on?Five.All right.- What'd you do at school today?
- Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.After school I got some baseball cards.- Mm-hm.
- That was fun.Okay, you know those
science-fiction movies?Star Trek, Star Wars.
They need an exotic location to shoot.Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.Now, imagine this:They're a Canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.We put it out there--The Canadian producers put it out there.--that we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.Then we go to the consulate and say,
""Hey, we wanna look at Iran too.""I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?We already have credentials
for the teachers.- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.John Chambers.
He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.He's got an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes.
Did a bunch of contract work for us in the past.I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you
give me a break? I can't breathe in this house.- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.Some Americans are missing.Look at the repaired list of embassy employees.The numbers don't match.Finish assembling the pictures from the embassy.All I need is their faces and I will find them.Yes, sir, it will be done.We want you to go to L.A.If you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.Don't fuck up.The whole country is watching you.They just don't know it.My creation.My creation.What the fuck, Brian?- Cut.
- We're cutting.- What an idiot.
- It really hurt.I'm sorry.Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.Mr. Chambers?Kevin Harkins.Hey, Tony.Watch your head.What are you shooting?Monster movie.Yeah? Any good?Target audience will hate it.Who's the target audience?People with eyes.Talk to me.It's an exfil.From where?Worst place you can think of.Universal City.How are you gonna get into the embassy?They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.They're hiding out in Tehran.- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?I need you to help me make a fake movie.Heh. You came to the right place.I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.- That we're not gonna make.
- No.So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?- Without actually doing anything?
- No.You'll fit right in.Let's see.Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.Here's your director.Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins......who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.You need a script. You need a producer.- Make me a producer.
- No.You're an associate producer at best.If you're gonna do a $20 million
Star Wars rip-off.. ....you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.Somebody respectable.With credits.Who you can trust
with classified information.Who'll produce a fake movie.For free.Hi. I only got a couple of minutes.
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.- Mazel tov, Lester.
- Ah.I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people......all of whom chant ""Death to America""
all the livelong day.You want to set up a movie in a week.You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here. .....into a country that wants CIA blood
on their breakfast cereal. .....and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.Right.Look, I gotta tell you.We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.Sir, the car is here.You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for--We're gonna need a script.Here, come on, come on, come on.- No, it's fine.
- Stop.Okay.I love you.PAT
Sahar, how are you doing?SAHAR
Fine, thank you.Your friends from Canada, ma'am.All this time. They never go out.PAT
Sahar knows.{\an8}How about The Horses of Achilles?{\an8}No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.Hey, Kenny, please.Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.The cardinal wants
all cover options on his desk Friday morning.Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.You have 72 hours to make yours better.Fine.Hey, is A006 still on the open list?Yeah, I'll hold.""Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.Argo. A science-fantasy adventure.""- It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?Why do we need the option?You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.Just let me do the talking.I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard......but I can handle him.You want to go into production
with this in one month?Up like a carny ride.One month, yeah.- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.He's the money.Look, what do you say 15 thou
and let's close on this?You want me to be honest with you, Les?No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.All right.I enjoyed your films. The early ones.I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.Thank you. Very respectful.You're finished, Lester.Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.MGM just capitalized for six new films.They're screaming for sci-fi.They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.Well, what can I say?Congratulations.But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at
Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai......when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.He wishes me well, we had a little chat.Seems he was attached
to star in Zulu Empire......which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget......because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental.. ....so the movie's kaput.Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen......and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.So the way it looks to me--Through the cataracts, I grant you.--is that you can either sign here......and take $10,000
for your toilet paper script.. ....or you can go fuck yourself.With all due respect.You really know Warren Beatty?Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.Taco?Got any kids, Lester?Yeah. I have two daughters.You see them much?I talk to them once a year.- Maybe.
- Why is that?I was a terrible father.The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.You?Yeah, I got a son.He lives in Virginia with his mother.You're divorced?Taking time off.He needs to be, you know. .....where he is.Kids need the mother.They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.Listen.Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.Thorough background examinations
should be expected.The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
I need another week, Jack.You don't have it.We got an office.We got business cards.We got a poster.If I'm the Revolutionary Guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.Six people's lives depend on this.It's not enough. If we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.If you wanna sell a lie... .You get the press to sell it for you.No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.They have costumes and everything.No, no, no, I can't.
Variety has an exclusive on that.Is there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?Mesopotamia? Egypt?Iran.Look, I can get you in, but you're
gonna have to promise me at least half a page.No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.You're doing the reading?I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.Great. I'll call you.Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.- You know her?

or what?No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.It goes everywhere.
It goes all throughout space.So it's the Argonaut.No.- What does ""Argo"" mean?
- I don't know.You don't know?It means ""Argo fuck yourself.""Excuse me. May I have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?If our artists could settle in.

should be not ""what?"" but ""who?""The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.--Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.For life?They will remain until the shah is returned.But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital......leaves the United States

those two old fucks on The Muppets.Aliens and robots?Yes, sir.You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now......that is funded by the CIA?Yes, sir.- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.You think this is more plausible
than teachers?Yes, we do.
One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad
with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.There are only bad options.It's about finding the best one.You don't have a better bad idea than this?This is the best bad idea we have, sir.By far.The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.Thank you, sir.I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.Barely claim me as it is.Your ""in case of's"" good?It's just Christine.I should've brought some books

of your visit to Iran?Uh, film production. Business.Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?I would've loved to, except my boss

with our lives, Mr. ..?Harkins.That's your real name?No.I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.But it is time to go.We've got orders to close the embassy
and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. I'm serious.No, no, no, this is what, the part when
we say this is so crazy it might actually work?Joe, I saw it in Burma. They get people out.Snitches in banana republics?
They get them over the border after the coup.That's your opinion, Joe.You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?Pat and I have discussed it.
It's the risk we took.That man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.And if he loses, it's our lives.And his life too.Look, we don't have any alternatives.We gotta go.These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.And then add to that.Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?The only way this works. .....is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you dream like them.Get started tonight.I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.Well, my guy kind of sucks.What's your name?Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.That was convincing.Kathy, what's your name?The Love Boat
will be seen 15 minutes from now.The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan......will not divert the attention of the
United States from the plight of the hostages.--is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant....Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union......over that country's invasion
of Afghanistan....The United States
is now moving toward a decision......to boycott the Summer Olympics
in Moscow....Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.""The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew.. ....at the Khayyam entrance
to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m.""They called your bluff.- Maybe they're cooperating.
- Absolutely not.Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.Seven Canadians, Jack.Never give them multiple shots at a cover.Are they even ready?They're getting there.There's no prize for ""Most Improved.""I don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence......and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up. .....when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.They suspect something?What I know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.We won't do it.He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.It would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.What else do we have to do, all right?He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding...- ...which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?Look, we don't have any other choice!Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?We're not in the CIA.It's suicide.I'm asking you to trust me.I don't trust you.This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.It's too dangerous.
I won't bring my wife into the bazaar.Joe?So we'll see you at 2.So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.Sorry. Okay.Hello?Who was that?- Mark?
- Yeah?I'm scared.It's okay.Where are they?In the kitchen.This is what I do. I get people out.And I've never left anyone behind.I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.My father worked construction.
My mother teaches elementary school.I have a wife and a 10-year-old son.You play along with me today,
I promise you, I will get you out tomorrow.Fuck.Shit.Hang on.You all right?Okay. Tell me who you are.Mike McEwan, cameraman.Robert Baker, director.Timothy Harris, location manager.Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.Rachel Dewart, production designer.Sean Bissett, associate producer.All right. Let's go make a movie.Welcome, welcome.

- Nice to meet you.This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.This is Tim.
This is Mary, our screenwriter.And this is our director, Bob Baker.- You are the director?
- Yes.Is this film a foreign-bride film?Sorry?A film where a foreign bride comes to Iran. .....but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs......and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.Oh, no.The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.You can find many items
such as paper, spices.. ....precious metals, all right here.Right this way, please.This way.- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.If I was to say you're looking through the
wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right?Yup.Just a little further.Please wait here. Let's stay together.He wants the photograph you took.It's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.That's okay. You can tell him he can have it.Please, please, just take the photograph.Peace be upon you.SAHAR
And upon you, sir. Welcome.I hope you are well.Thank you very much. How are you?I'm very well. What's your name?Sahar.He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.No, no, no! No! Canada!Canada!I would like to suggest that we end our visit.You know, sister......those who are with him, Rasool of Allah,
we are tender among ourselves.But stern against the Kufar.As God wills it.But those who sit silently have sinned.How else may I help, sir?No, no, just one thing.How long have they been here?Pardon?The guests of the Ambassador.The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?They arrived two days ago.Forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.How'd it go?What about tomorrow?Tomorrow they'll be ready.For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround......one week after humiliation in Illinois.I love New York.And I love Connecticut too.How did he win here? Well, he had help.I'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.The six with the Canadians
are coming out.Who signed off on this?- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.- Where were you born?
- Toronto.""Torono."" Canadians don't pronounce the T.Some Komiteh guard
is actually gonna know that?If you're detained for questioning, they will
bring in someone who knows that. Yes.Mary, who were the last three prime ministers
of Canada?Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.- What's your father's name?

- Halifax, Nova Scotia.What's your date of birth?February 21st, 1952.- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.- Associate. Last movie you produced?
- High and Dry.- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.You have to know your rÃ©sumÃ©
back to front.You really believe your little story's gonna make
a difference when there's a gun to our heads?I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.Okay.Hey, they made it through
the location scout.You have a call.What is it?Go to black on green.Go.- It all just changed.
- What?- They're calling the game. You gotta come back.
- What?Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.So if the six of them......are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed
them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.Six Americans get pulled out
of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed.. ....it's a world outrage.Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe......with the CIA at the airport and executed?It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.We're responsible for these people.What we are is required to follow orders.I'm sorry.Fuck!Come in.Ready to try again.You're ready. You worked hard.Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be.. ....just to relax.Okay.You did good.Thanks.Scorched-earth policy tonight.Nothing gets left.So you know.ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.If we tell them now, they'll panic.
I think it's best if you just don't show.It was always a fucked mission.You came closer than anybody else.If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to breakWhen the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stayAhem. It's off.
They want us to pack up the office.This can wait. Let's go get a drink.He's late.O'Donnell.Somebody's responsible......when things happen, Jack.I'm responsible.- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?Carter's gotta say yes for us
to get the tickets.It's time to go.All right.- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.- Pull him out.
- Uh.. ..Pull him out!Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.- Thank you.
- See you soon.- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.Sahar will be fine.- Thank you.
- Thank you.- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.Good.N.E. said no.This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!It is going!Jack, you are this close.Am l? Am I really that close?You are this goddamn close to the line
with me.I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!Get to your plane, Claude.First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.Passports came straight from Ottawa
last week. They're clean.Find the White House chief of staff.How would I find him?We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!The second checkpoint is immigration.You're each gonna hand them one of these.It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.You'll say you don't know what happened.And if you believe they lost the white slip......they'll believe it too.Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.Where are his kids?What?Where do his kids go to school?Thank you, thank you.Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.White House.Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.Hold for the chief of staff's office.The third checkpoint is the trap.It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.And all of whom are looking for Americans.Hello?- Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.
- Wait, wait, who?Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.They are going to be captured.David, pick up!Zurich. It's under Harkins.I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.Telex on flash.Would you mind checking again, please?Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!My apologies. It just came through.Swissair says they picked up the tickets.Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.We told them to shut that down.There you go.Not here.When did you come to Iran?Two days ago.What was the purpose of your visit?We are looking for locations for a film.We have a--Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.If you want to take a look at that. All right?- Ahem.
- You can go.Come on, come on.Swissair Flight 363
is now boarding Rows 18 to 35.We're going to. ...We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.They should have boarded already.Still no answer in L.A.Sir.STAFFORD Yes, it's a fantasy story
about a war in another world.Here you can see our notices.Of course I speak Farsi.I wish to make a film in Iran.No, I'm the writer.Kevin, give me the storyboards.These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.Alien villains have taken over the hero's planet.They fight for their families and
take back the city.The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.So he and his wife storm the castle.The people...hold that... the people are inspired to join him.
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.They shoot weapons at their enemies.And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.You don't go until we verify.I understand.Sir, you can call our office.They'll verify.- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.- We're just going to the Producers Building.
- Yeah, I understand. We're shooting right now.Swissair announces
final boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.Reset! We're back to one.- All right, reset.
- We're going again!- We're just right at the Producers--
- Right away, everyone! And rolling!- We're going to the Producers Building.
- We're rolling.Sorry, pal. We're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agent.Sir!Studio Six Productions.May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May I take a message?Doors are closing for Flight 363 to Zurich.We can go.You keep these. It's a gift.Miss.Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?Swissair 363,
you are number two for departure.Ladies and gentlemen, from
the flight deck, we are number two for takeoff.Swissair 363, you are cleared for takeoff.Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.We got wheels up.Wait.Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce......that alcoholic beverages are now available
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.I love you.They're clear. Ha-ha-ha!Yes! Yes!- Yeah!
- Yes!Yeah, man.They're out!- They're out! They're out!
- We got them out!They're out!Yes!Great work, boys.We did it!You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.We made history tonight.History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.Quote's the other way around.- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.Groucho said that?Call the Times, nail it to the goddamn door.CIA are the good guys.The Canadians are the good guys.Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.Great Satan wasn't involved.No CIA.Is that right, Jack?Involved in what?We were as surprised as anybody.Thank you, Canada.{\an8}We knew that each day they stayed there...{\an8}...the danger was becoming greater.We had been looking for a solution to have them
leave the country during the past three months.Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford. .....Kathy Stafford.. ....Mark Lijek.. ..{\an8}We Americans will be forever grateful
to our great friend and ally to the north......for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.Bob Anders.Here, or anywhere in the world......Canada will pay......for this violation
of the sovereignty of Iran.Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
I'm having breakfast.Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:""You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?""And I said to her-- Do you know what I said?No, what?""Argo fuck yourself.""All set.Thanks a lot.Ha!Heh. And I left my autograph book at home.His Eminence called me.He wants to see you.Probably wants to fire me himself.He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.You're getting the highest award of merit. .....of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.Ceremony's on the 14th.If they push it a week, I can bring Ian.
That's his winter break.The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.That's right.If we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.- I thought we did.
- Ha.Carter said you were a great American.Great American what?He didn't say.What happened to your picture?It's in turnaround.Can I come in?{\an7}The Iran Hostage Crisis ended on
January 20, 1981, when all remaining
hostages were released.
They spent 444 days in captivity.{\an8}The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented efforts of the
Canadian embassy in freeing the six held in Tehran.
To this day, this story stands as an enduring
model for international cooperation between
governments.{\an9}All of the Houseguests returned
to the U.S. Foreign Service after
their ordeal in Iran.{\an8}Oscar-winning makeup artist
John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s
Intelligence Medal, its highest civilian honor.
He and Mendez remained friends
until Chambers' death in 2001.{\an5}Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star was returned
to him in 1997, when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.{\an8}He lives in rural Maryland with his family.They went in, as you know, under
the guise of creating a motion-picture film.But that it had a very high possibility
of failure.And after it was successful, of course......it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...{\an8}...so maybe I could take a little bit
of credit for it, since I was president...{\an8}...but we had to keep it secret.
Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...{\an8}...after his retirement...{\an8}...as one of the 50 most important
CIA operatives of all time.{\an8}Eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...{\an8}...and we upheld the integrity of our country,
and we did it peacefully."

Okay, Alonzo?Can I get a kiss, please?
Thank you.Travel safely.Stay safely.Ready?Devil call his
name, there he is now.Mr. Northup!I have two gentlemen whose
acquaintance you should make.Misters Brown and Hamilton.Sir.Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen...were inquiring about
distinguished individuals...and I was just this very moment...saying Solomon Northup is an
expert player on the violin.He was indeed.Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.Well, taking into considerationhis graciousness
and your modesty...may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse, sir?Of course.Good day.<i>A circus?</i>That is our usual employee.The company currently
in the city of Washington.Circus is too
constricting a word...to describe the talented and
merry band with which we travel.It is a spectacle unlike
most have ever witnessed.Creatures from the darkest Africaas yet unseen by civilized man.Acrobats from the Orient...who contort themselves in the
most confounding manners.And I myself
in aide of Mr. Brown...an internationally
renowned practitionerin the art of prestidigitation.We are on our way thither to rejointhe company having left
for a short time...to make a small profit from
our own exhibitions.The reason for our inquiry
with Mr. Moon...Yes.
We had just a devil of a timein procuring music
for our entertainments.Men of true talents are
seemingly in short supply.Thank you, sir.If we could persuade you to
accompany us as far as Washington...We could give you one dollar
for each day's services...and three dollars for every night
played at our performances.In addition, we would
provide sufficient pay...for your return here to
Saratoga, two weeks from today.Welcome to Washington, Solomon.Hamilton, you know too much.Some say not enough.Solomon, 43 dollars.
All to you.That is far more
than my wages amount to.It's been a most
profitable week, sir.Cheers.
Cheers.Cheers.Another.Gentlemen, your generosity
is extraordinary.And your talents are undeniable.Mmm. To Solomon.Cheers.Ugh!It's all right, Solomon.There's no shame in it.No shame at all.Hamilton, we must hurry.One too many libation.We're halfway there.<i>So sorry...</i>We won't hear it. We won't.Let him sleep, Hamilton.Mmm.
A good night's rest.And tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshedas if the earth were new again.Hamilton, there's
nothing more we can do for him.Such is the pity.Well, boy, how do you feel now?My name... My name
is Solomon Northup.I'm a free man. A resident
of Saratoga, New York.The residence of my wife and
children who are equally free.And you have no right
whatsoever to detain me.You're not any free man.And I promise you...I promise you upon my liberationI will have satisfaction
for this wrong.Resolve this.Produce your papers.You're no free man.And you ain't from Saratoga.You're from Georgia.You ain't a free man.You're nothing but
a Georgia runaway.You're just a runaway nigger...from Georgia.You're a slave!You're a Georgia slave!Are you a slave?No.Help.Help me.Help me!Somebody help me!Help!Help!That old thing of yours
is just rags and tatters.You need something proper to wear.Go on, put it on.There.That's fine.That's fine.Got no gratitude?No. That's from my wife.Rags and tatters.Rags and tatters.Go on, wash up.The boy, too.
Get him clean.Scrub now.Do you know when my mama will come?Hush him up!Mama! Mama!Quiet.Quiet, please.
Mama!Hush him up!Your mother will come, I swear she will.
But you must be silent.Be silent.We need a sympathetic ear.An opportunity to
explain our situation.Who, in your estimation,
is that sympathetic ear?The two men I journeyed with.I'm certain they're making
enquiries at this very moment.I'd be just as
certain they're countingthe money paid for delivering
you to this place.They were not kidnappers, they
were artists. Fellow performers.You know that?You know for certain
who they were?The reality to come is us
being transported southward.New Orleans, if I was to venture.After we arrive,
we'll be put to market.And beyond that...Well, I suppose once in a slave
state, there's only one outcome.No.I don't say that to give
you empty agitation, John.For y'all, there ain't
nothing but that.But John wasn't kidnapped.John's just being held
as debt, that's all.Master pay his debt
and John be redeemed.Boy, our masters
will not come for us.John is sorry for y'all,
but that's how it be.Where you're going,
you're going without John.Mama!
Randall!Mama!Are you all right?Are you all right?Thank you, God.Come on. Get up.I said, get up!
No, don't...I don't want to hear you talk!

taking a little trip, that's all.Don't want to
frighten the childrenover a little boat ride, do you?John's master gonna pay his debt.Line up!His master gonna pay his debt!I don't want to hear a word

Come on.Come on, child.
Come on.Follow your mama.Come on, boy.Up these stairs.Get down out
of that wagon. Come on.Come on. Move it!Let's go!Up, up, up the stairs.Come on, let's go.Come on, move it!All right, come on.Hey, you.
Get up.Sit down, right there.Come on.Right there. Just sit down.Cheer up and don't be so cast down.If you want to survive, do and
say as little as possible.Tell no one who you really are and
tell no one you can read and write.Unless you want to
be a dead nigger.Now keep your mouth shut.I say we fight.The crew is fairly small.Were it well planned, I believe
they could be strong-armed.Three can't go
against the whole crew.The rest here are niggers.Born and bred slaves.Niggers ain't got
no stomach for a fight.Not a damn one.All's I know, if we get
where we're traveling...we'll wish we'd died trying.Survival's not about
certain death,it's about keeping your head down.Days ago, I was with my family...in my home.Now you tell me all is lost.""Tell no one who I am.""
That's the way to survive?Well, I don't want to survive.I want to live.Better off.Better than us.I don't see him.Clemens!Clemens Ray!

you in a new cravat?Pure silk, by way of the French.We're in need of a fresh
carryall for my Mrs.'s travels.Nothing more.The year has passed already.Off to work at Sandy Hill again?I am.I have just the thing.Something to suit your style...and yet sturdy enough
for the 40-mile round trip.It's beautiful.At what price?We will take it.Children, come see what you
father has just purchased for me.One moment, sir,
and you'll be assisted.Mr. Parker.
Sir?If we could discuss the price.Oh, forgive me, Solomon.
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.A customer waits.

hear your name. Eliza.Lethe!John.Oren.Platt.Platt.Stand up.You fit the description given.Why didn't you answer when called?My name is not Platt.My name...Your name is Platt.Captain, get these
niggers to my cart.Mmm.Move.I believe I have
something very muchto your liking in the back room.Follow me, please.Yes. Now, inspect them
at your leisure...but I ask you to pay particular
regard to young Ezra here.Incredibly sound limbs.I have never seen anything
quite like him.And this marvelous creature.
Can you believe it? Mmm?She'll make a fine lady's maid.Madam?So, inspect at your leisure.Take your time.
Help yourself to refreshments.Gentlemen, what catches
your fancy here? Hmm?This boy? Yes?Open your mouth.
Open wider.Look in there. Never been
sick a day in his life.And I call particular
attention to Martha.She is an excellent pastry cook.Ah, Mr. Ford.Splendid seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?This lad? He's very brawny.How much for the ones
Platt and Eliza?Ah, yes.A thousand for Platt.
Uh... Oh.This is a nigger of considerable
talent, I assure you.700 for Eliza.My fairest price.Mmm.You will accept a note?Please, sir.
Do not divide my family.Do not take me unless
you take my children.Eliza! Quiet!You will have the most
faithful slave in me.The most faithful slave
that has ever lived.But I beg that you
do not separate us.Your price for the boy?Eliza! Stop it!I will give you
something to cry about.Randall, come forward.
Come, come, come.Now, do you see
how fit this boy is?Like ripe fruit.May I take your stick a moment?
Observe this.Randall, jump, jump, jump.
Run, run, run.Very good! Higher.Now, you see this.It's very likely he will
grow into a fine beast.600 for the boy.Fair and final.Done.Superb. A moment, please.Mr. Ford.Please.
Eliza!How much for the little girl?Ah...You have no use for her.One so young will
bring you no profit.No, no, no.
I cannot sell the girl.No, there's heaps and piles
of money to be made from her.She's a beauty.
One of the regular bloods.None of your thick-lipped, bullet-heated,
cotton-picking niggers, here.Her child, man.Please.For God's sake, are you not
sentimental in the least?My sentimentality extends
the length of a coin.God, please.Now do you take this lot,
Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them?Please, please.
Please.I will take the ones
Platt and Eliza.Sold, Eliza and Platt.I will not go without my children!Goddamn sniveling wench!You will not take them from me!God damn you! Get her out of here, Cape!Please! No! No!Get her out of here, god damn it!Platt, get your fiddle.
Play, play, play something.I will give you something to cry
about, you goddamned witch!Get her out of here, Cape!
Out, now!Mama! Mama! Mama!Yes.Mr. Ford, a pleasure.Did you bring all those niggers?Two of them?
You got two?Mr. Chapin.This one's crying.
Why is this one crying?Separated from her children.Oh, dear.
It couldn't be helped.Poor, poor woman.Mr. Chapin.
Yes, sir.Tomorrow, you have
to take these twoup to the mill and
start them working.For now, make them adequate.Fix them a meal and have
them rest themselves.Yes, sir.Come on, now.Come on! Don't dawdle!Something to eat, and some rest.Your children will
soon be forgotten.For all of you raw niggers
that don't know...my name is John Tibeats, William
Ford's chief carpenter.You will refer to me as ""Master.""Mr. Chapin is the overseer
on this plantation.You, too, will refer
to him as ""Master.""So, clap your hands.Like this. Come on.Come on, now.

way to Bartholomew's?I can, ma'am.This is a list of
goods and sundries.You will take it to be filled

add it to our debt.Yes, Mistress.Where you from, Platt?I told you.Tell me again.Washington.Who were your master?Master name a Freeman.Was he a learned man?I suppose so.He learn you to read?A word, here or there.But I have no understanding
of the written...Don't trouble yourself with it.Same as the rest. Master brought
you here to work, that's all.Any more will earn you 100 lashes.Come here, boy.Come on.Where you going, boy?On my way to Bartholomew's.Sent by Mistress Epps.You best get there, then.Get there quick.Any trouble?No, ma'am. No trouble.Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.Good morning, Master Shaw.Master sent me to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?You may.Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.Nigger Platt.Patsey, Master
wishes you to return.The Sabbath day,
I is free to roam.Master sent me running to fetch
you, said no time should be wasted.Drink of tea?Thank you, Mistress,
but I don't dare.Would you know of
Master Epps's consternation...to be any lessened
with your timely return?Anger's his constant condition.Sit.Sit and drink
the tea that I offered.What'n be Epps's concern?I'd rather not say.Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine.
All things in moderation.As you are aware...Master Epps is a man
of hard countenance.You know he has ill feeling
towards your husband.He do.Master Epps has somehow
come to believe...that Master Shaw
is something of a lothario.A misguided belief, no doubt.No doubt...if not born out of truth itself.I meant no disrespect.He ain't heard you.I meant no
disrespect to you, Mistress.Got no cause to worry
for my sensibilities.I ain't felt the end of a lash
in more years I can recall.I ain't worked a field, neither.Where once I served...now, I have others serving me.The cost to my current existence...be Master Shaw
broadcasting his affections...and me enjoying
the pantomime of his fidelity.If that what keep me from cotton
picking niggers, that what it be.A small and reasonable price
to be paid, for sure.I know what it like
to be the objectof Master's predilections
and peculiarities.A lusty visit in the night...or a visitation with the whip.Take comfort, Patsey.The good Lord will manage Epps.In His own time, the good
Lord will manage them all.The curse of the pharaohs
were a poor example...of what wait for
the plantation class.This is nice.Pats. Patsey!Do not look in his direction.
Continue on.Patsey!
Found her, Master.And brought her back,
just as instructed.What did you just now tell her?What did you say to Pats?No words were spoken,
none of consequence.You're a liar.You damn liar.I saw you talking with her.Tell me.I cannot speak of
what did not occur.I'll cut your black throat!Master!You come here.Master Epps.
I said come here!I brought her back,
just like you...Come here!
Master!Master.I got her, just as instructed.Master EPPS!You stay away from Pats, boy.Master Epps.It's the Lord's day.Ain't nothing Christian
in us carrying on like this.I concede to you.In the name of valor...help your master to his feet.I'm gonna kill you!What's the fuss?Master Epps believed Patsey and meto be in conversation
when we were not.I tried to explain,
but it's led to all this.What is it?You can't remain the Sabbath
without her under your eye?You are a no-account bastard.A filthy, godless heathen.My bed is too holy
for you to share.What's he been telling you?Of your misbegotten ways.And he would know what of anything?I ain't even spoken with him today.You lying nigger, Platt.Have I?Have I?There.
There's all the truth he got.Damn nigger.Patsey.A moment from the dancing.Come sample what I baked for y'all.Thank you, Mistress.Thank you, Mistress.There will be none for you, Patsey.You see that?You see that look
of insolence she give me?I seen nothing but her turn away.Are you blind or ignorant?It was hot, hateful scorn.It filled that black face.You tell me you didn't see it...it's because you choose not to
look, or are you saying I lie?Whatever it was, it passed.Is that how you
are with the niggers?Letting every ill thought
fester inside them?Look at them.They foul with it.They foul with their hate.You let it be, it's gonna come
back to us in the dark of night.You want that?You want them
black animals leave usgut like pigs in our own sleep?Oh...You are manless.A damn eunuch if there ever was.If you won't stand
for me, I pray you'dat least be a credit
to your own kind...and beat every foul
thought from them.Beat it from them!Eat.Fill yourselves.And then we dance.I said, eat.Platt.Platt, you awake?I am.I have a request.An act of kindness.I secreted it from the mistress.Return it.It yours, Platt.For what cause?All I ask, end my life.Take my body to
the margin of the swamp.Take me by the throat,
hold me low in the water...until I is still and without life.Bury me in a lonely
place of dying.I will do no such thing.The gory detail
with which you speak...I thought on it long and hard.It is melancholia.Nothing more.How can you fall
into such despair?How can you not know?I ain't got no
comfort in this life.If I can't buy mercy from you...I'll beg it.There are others.Beg them.
I'm begging you.Why?Why would you consign me to damnation
with such an ungodly request?There is God here!God is merciful...and he forgive merciful acts.Won't be no hell for you.Do it.Do what I ain't got the
strength to do myself.<i>It's a plague.</i><i>It's cotton worm.</i><i>It's a plague.
It's damn biblical.</i><i>Two seasons God done

plagues to him, you hear?Or I'll take it out on your skin.Get out.Get off the porch. You ain't
supposed to be on the porch.Get off the porch.Platt, is it?Yes, sir.You cultivate cane previously?No, sir, I have not.It comes to you quite naturally.Are you educated?No, sir. Niggers are hired
to work, not read or write.You play the fiddle.Yes, sir. Yes, I do.Willard Yarner,
a planter up the bayou...celebrates his anniversary
in three weeks' time.I'll hold out your name to him.What you earn is yours to keep.Yes, sir.Mind yourself, Platt.Whoa!Joyous day.Joyous day.Dark times is behind us.Clean living and prayer
done lifted the plague!As thick and white
as New England snow.Now, my niggers is returned to me.Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.Did you beguile him, Platt,
with your slick nigger ways?You won't stand idle, boy.Not on my land.Much work to do!Days of old long since, huh?Joyous.Joyous, indeed! Whoo!Let's go find something
sweet for you.

Don't ever let me down.Platt?160 pounds.Armsby?64 pounds.A good day's labor
would average 200 pounds.Yes, sir.I'm sure in time, you'll
develop as a picker.But it takes effort, boy.Put some damn effort into it.Yes, sir.Take them out, get to whipping.It's a tragedy.How does such come to pass?Working a field and picking
cotton like a lowly hand.I'm of a damn sight better station.I worked as an overseer, you know.I did not know, sir.Not ""sir.""Just ""Armsby.""I'm not owed more than
any other in the field.How did you arrive at such
a place, if I may ask?Ask, it's just conversation.I became a little too
dependent on the whiskey...a little too
undependable on the job.Now, before you say
I'm just a sorry drunkard...let me state my case.As reliable employment
as overseeing is,it is no easy chore on the spirit.I say, no man of conscious...can take the lash to another
human day in and day out...without shredding at his own self.Takes him to a place...where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...or he finds some way to trample
his guilty sensations.So, I trampled.With frequency.I gave in to tales
of wealth and prosperity.But such profitable outcomes are
reserved for plantation masters.It's the lot of
the rest of us to serve.Now, all I want is to earn a
decent wage and get myself home.The proceeds of
my fiddling performances.Just a few picayunes,
but all I have in the world.I promise them to you if you
will do me the favor I require.But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.Uh...What is it you ask?First, your word, sir.On my honor.It's a simple enough request.I only ask that
you deposit a letterat the post office
in Marksville...and that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.A patron is what I require, sir.I'll do it.And I'll accept
whatever payment's offered.To assist you,
I put my own self at risk.I will do so...but fair compensation
is all I ask.Draw up your letter.We'll meet again in two days?In two days.Thank you.Well, boy...I understand I got a learned
nigger that writes letters.Tries to get white
fellas to mail them.Armsby told me today...the devil was among my niggers.That I had one that
needed watching...or he would run away.When I asked him why...he said you come over to him...waked him up in the
middle of the night...and wanted him to
carry a letter...to Marksville.What do you got to say to that?There's no truth to it.You say.How could I write a letter
without ink or paper?Who am I gonna write to? I got
no friends living as I know of.That Armsby...That Armsby is a lying,
drunken fellow.Didn't he want you to
hire him as an overseer?Well, that's it.He wants to make you believe
we're all gonna run away...so you'll hire him as an overseer.He believes you're a soft soap.And he's given to such talk.Made this story
out of whole cloth...because he wants a situation.It's all a lie, Master.It's all a lie.I'll be damned.Were he not free and white, Platt.Were he not free and white.<i>Sun gonna set here</i><i>Under the mountain</i><i>Sun gonna set here</i><i>Under the mountain</i><i>Sun gonna set here</i><i>Under the mountain</i>Edward!Get him water.Get up!Get up!Nigger, get up!What you looking at, boy?Keep picking, boy!I just wanna say something

respite from the heat.Drink, shade.It's ungodly for travelers,
hearty or otherwise.What's funny?Epps, I merely mean to finish
the work at hand, as requested.And as paid for.If something rubs you wrongly...I offer you the opportunity
to speak on it.You ask plainly, so I
will tell you plainly.What amused me just then was your concern
for my well-being in this heat...when, quite frankly, the
condition of your laborers...""The condition of my laborers""?It is horrid.
It's all wrong.All wrong, Mr. Epps.They ain't hired help.They're my property.You say that with pride.I say it as fact.If this conversation
concerns what is factualand what is not,
then it must be said...that there is no justice nor
righteousness in their slavery.But you do open up
an interesting question.What right have
you to your niggers,when you come down to the point?What right?
Mmm.I bought them.
I paid for them.Of course you did, and the law saysyou have the right
to hold a nigger.But begging
the law's pardon, it lies.Suppose they pass a law taking awayyour liberty, making you a slave.Suppose.That ain't a supposable case.Laws change, Epps.Universal truths are constant.It is a fact,
a plain and simple fact...that what is true and right
is true and right for all.White and black alike.You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?I'm only asking, in the eyes of
God, what is the difference?You might as well ask
what the difference isbetween a white man and a baboon.I seen one of them
critters in Orleans.Know just as much
as any nigger I got.Listen, Epps.These niggers are human beings.If they are allowed to climb no
higher than brute animals...you and men like you
will have to answer for it.There is an ill, Mr. Epps...a fearful ill
resting upon this nation.And there will be
a day of reckoning yet.You like to hear
yourself talk, Bass...better than any man I know of.You'd argue that black was
white, or white, black...if anybody would contradict you.A fine supposition if you lived
among Yankees in New England.But you don't.You most assuredly do not.I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!Patsey!Pats!Where is she?Where's Pats?Where is she, damn it?
Where is she?Phebs, where is she? Where is Patsey?
Where is she?What you standing there for?We know nothing of her, Master.Know nothing of what?
We know nothing of...Of what?
Where has she gone?She run off, ain't she?I don't know, Master.Where is she?
I don't know, Master.You know, you know, you know!You know!No, I don't!You miserable black dogs.You stand like the deaf and dumb.Speak!She gone.My Pats is gone.Run off?
Run off, did you?Master Epps... You miserable wench.
Where you been?I been nowhere!Lies to your misdeeds!The Sabbath day, Master.
I took mea walk to commune with the Lord.Bring the Lord
into your deceptions?You're coming from
Shaw's plantation.No!
Master Epps.Now, you speak?Now that you want to add to her
lies, you find your tongue!I went to Master Shaw's plantation.Ah! You admit it.Yes, freely.And you know why?I got this from Mistress Shaw.Mistress Epps won't even grant
me no soap to clean with.I stink so much, I make myself gag!500 pounds of cotton.Day I"", day out!More than any man here.And for that, I will be clean.That's all I ask.This, here,
what I went to Shaw's for.Liar.The Lord knows that's all!You're a liar.And you, blind with
your own covetousness!I don't lie, Master.If you kill me,
I'll stick to that.I'll fetch you down.I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.Treach.Run and fetch some line.Edward!Strip her. Strike her bare
and lash her to the post.You done this to yourself, Pats.Do it.Strike the life from her.Beat her.Give her the whip!
Give it all to her!Platt, you come here
and you beat her now.Platt!Come here!I'd rather it you, Platt!You strike her.Strike her.He pantomimes.There's barely a welt on her.That's what your
niggers make of you...a fool for the taking.Strike her, Platt.
Strike her!You will strike her.You will strike her
until her fleshis rent and meat and
blood flow equal...or I will kill every
nigger in my sight.You understand me?Strike her! Strike her!Until I say no more.
I ain't said nothing!Give me the whip!Get up!Thou devil!Sooner or later...somewhere in the course of eternaljustice, thou shalt
answer for this sin!Sin? There is no sin.Man does how he pleases
with his property.At the moment, Platt,
I'm of great pleasure.You be goddamn
careful I don't want tocome and lighten
my mood no further.Master Bass.I want to ask you what part
of the country you come from.No part of this land.I originate from Canada.Now, guess where that is.I know where Canada is.I've been there myself.Montreal...and Kingston and Queenston
and a great many places.Well-traveled for a slave.How came you here?Master Bass...if justice had been done,
I never would have been here.How's this?Tell me all.I'm afraid to tell you.Every word you speak
is a profound secret.Your story...it is amazing.And in no good way.Do you believe, sir,
in justice, as you said?I do.That slavery is an evil
that should befall none?I believe so.If you truly do...then I ask, I beg...that you write my friends
in the north...acquainting them of my situation...and beseeching them
to forward free papers.It would be...an unspeakable happiness...to see my wife...and my family again.I traveled this country for
the best part of 20 years...and my freedom is everything.The fact that I can walk out of here
tomorrow brings me great pleasure.My life doesn't
mean much to anyone.It seems yours might mean a
lot to a whole lot of people.But what you ask of me,
sir, scares me.And I must say, I am afraid.Not just for you, but for me.I will write your letter, sir.And if it brings you your freedom,it will be more than a pleasure.It will have been my duty.Now, would you kindly
hand me those shingles?Platt!Where's the boy called Platt?Come here, boy.Your name is Platt, is it?Yes, sir.You know that man?Mr. Parker.Say again?Mr. Parker.That man received a letter
compiling many accusations.You look me in the eye...and on your life,
you answer me truthfully.Have you any other name than Platt?Solomon Northup is my name.Sheriff, what's all this?It's official business.My nigger, my business.Your business waits.Tell me of your family.I have a wife, two children.What the hell?What are your children's names?
Margaret and Alonzo.What was your wife's name
before her marriage?Anne Hampton.
I am who I say.Where you going, Platt?Who authorized you
to interfere with my property?My authority.Platt, you come back here.
Platt!You come back here, boy.Boy.You unhand him.
Platt is my nigger!He is Mr. Solomon Northup.You say.You come here, unfamiliar
to me, and make claims.I got no doubts. The man
is Solomon Northup.The hell he is! He's my nigger,
and I'll fight you for him!As is your right.As it will be my pleasure to
bankrupt you in the courts.Your decision.
Unhand him.I know you had some
hand in this, Platt.I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.Pay him no mind.I paid good money for this nigger.Courthouse got papers to prove it!And we got papers
proving he's free!I own you. You belong to me.
You hear me, Platt?Unhand him!You'll have 200 stripes
across your back by sundown!Platt!Get my horse, Treach.Get away from him, Pats.I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.Solomon, we need to make haste.No.Solomon.I'll apologize...for my appearance.But I have had...a difficult time...these past several years.Margaret.Alonzo.Who is this?He's my husband.Husband.It is very good to meet you, sir.We have much acquainting to do.Yes, sir.And this is your grandson.Solomon Northup Staunton.Solomon.Anne...forgive me.There is nothing to forgive.<i>Went

I was keeping her place.I get reported, I come

You do that.My feet are already
killing me.I made Brewster
pigs in a blankettonight before leaving...and boy, he just ate 'em up.No ""thank-yous"",
no ""yum-yums"".Not a peep.Man is as silent as a grave.But if farts were flattery...honey, he'd be Shakespeare.Then I get home
and I make him breakfast.Eggs, bacon,
and buttered toast.I butter
the man's toast, Elisa.Mmm-hmm, both sides....as if he was a child.And I don't even
get a thank-you.You'd be gratefulbecause you're
an educated woman.But my Brewster,
all he had going for himwas animal magnetism
back in the day.Hasn't worked in a while.What in the Sam Hill? No!You boys mind putting
the trash in the can?That's what it's there for.Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.All right, all right.
Sorry, Zelda! Sorry!I don't know
what they're doing.Making a goddamn mess
is what I think.Zelda!
Stop that chatter, please.Yes, sir.There's no call
for the blasphemy.Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.A moment of your time!Today, we are receiving
a new teamand asset here in T-4.This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetlerfrom our sister facility
in Galveston.Now, I don't wanna bolster
or overstate the matterbut this may very well be
the most sensitive assetever to be housed
in this facility.- How was your trip?
- Fine. Who's security here?Just one moment, please.Security! Who's security?Welcome to T-4, sir.Yes, sir, I am Fleming,
head of Security.And if there are questions
you have or concerns...you just come talk to me.Do you understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.Get them out.Help me move this
cylinder into the compressor.Bring it here.
Bring it here.Bring it over here.
There. Mount the cylinder.We need to pressurize it
immediately.- From there to there.
- Elisa! Elisa!Come on!Lord, what goes on
in this place?Did you see that?Yes, I'm wearing
the hairpiece.How does it look?Oh! Be careful of the car.And it's not a hairpiece.It's a toupee. It's French.<i>It's eternal, see?</i>Tantalus never achieved
the escape of death....because the fruit
on the brancheswas just always
out of his reach...and the water
in the stream recededevery time he
stooped down to drink.And so that's why
we say things today like...""Look at those
tantalizing pies.""Thank you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?Yes, pies for breakfast.Just trust me on this.Hey, folks!
Welcome to Dixie Doug's.I've seen you
in here before, right?Yes.I've been here a couple
of times, as a matter of fact.Partial to key lime pie?I am, I am.
Two to go.Just go with it,
please. Please.Uh, I, uh, it's a craving
that I indulge in.Can't possibly be good for me,
but nothing I like is.No, no, it's a mighty
fine pie, key lime.You wouldn't happen to bethe famous ""Dixie Doug""
himself, would you?Oh, heck no.The pies are trucked
throughout the country.- They call it ""franchising,"" see?
- Oh.They give us the spinners,
the signage.That there's ""Pie Boy,""
our mascot.I don't talk like that.I'm from Ottawa.No.I completely bought it.""That's-a-great-a-pie.""The... The, uh...The little... little guy,
is he supposed to be Italian?I guess so.Well, it's very clever.Y'all come back now, you hear?""Y'all come back now.""Do you think he meant it?He had noticed me.
I mean, you... you heard that.This pie is rather sordid.But don't spit it out.Next time we go,we'll just try
a different flavor. Hmm?Save it for later,
put it away.<i>6:00 AM eastern standard time.</i><i>The skies are beginning

to when I was 18...I didn't know anything

a bit of advice.I would say, ""Take better

minds in the countrypeeing all over the floor
in this here facility.Mmm, mmm, mmm.There's pee freckles
on the ceiling now.How'd they get it up there?Just how big a target
do they need, you figure?They get enough practice,
that's for sure.My Brewster...no one's ever called him
a great mind,but even he manages
to hit the can70% of the time.Excuse us, sir.No, no, no,
that's all right.Go ahead.You ladies seem to be
chatting enjoyably.Girl talk, no doubt.Don't mind me.Elisa.Look, don't touch.That lovely dingus
right thereis an Alabama Howdy-do.Molded grip handle...low current, high-voltage,
electric shock cattle prod.Name's Strickland, Security.Fleming's security.Oh, no.No, a man washes his handsbefore or after
tending to his needs.It tells you a lot
about a man.He does it both times...points to a weakness
in character.Ladies.It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.<i>Short people are mean.</i>I never met a short manthat stayed nice
all the way through.No, sir.Mean little backstabbers,
all of them.Maybe it's the air down there,not enough oxygen
or something.Help! He's losing blood!Help!Come on, come on.You think
the Russians broke in?I don't think so.And if they did...Duane's meatloaf
will kill them all, honey.It was two shots.
Did you hear them?All right, three.
And that scream.Lord, what ever happens
in this place?You two, come with me.Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?Any chance we get
to conclude our dinner?Now!Oh, heavens to Betsy.We are in a pickle.We are in such a pickle.You will have
exactly 20 minutesto render this... this lab
immaculate, and so on and so forth.20 minutes.It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?I can handle pee.I can handle poo.But blood... Ugh.Blood just does
something to me.Here, hon. Help me mop it up.The sooner we get outta here
the better.Is that a tater tot?Oh!It's a finger.There's two fingers.Okay, okay.Put them away.
And just wait here.I'm gonna go get Mr. Fleming.Where are these body parts?The body parts?No, I believe you, honey.But are you sure it was alive?Because I saw a mermaid once
in a carnival tent...and it was a monkey
sewn to the tail of a fish.Looked real to me.All right, I apologize.Oh! I have a deadline.Do you know,corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.Didn't work.Oh, Alice Faye just started.She was a huge star, huge.And one day, she couldn't
take the bullshitand the backstabbing anymore.She just walked away
from it all.Ta-da!That's not bad, is it?For being shit.Listen. You eat,
you go to bed, you rest.And when I get paid...<i>âª I'm so blue without you âª</i>we get pie!No, we don't get pie.

- New concept.That's the future now.
Green.Oh, and they want them
happier, the family.- Happier? Happier?
- Mmm.The father looks likehe just discovered
the missionary position.Giles.Well, what are they supposed
to be happy about?The client wanted photographs,
I sold them on this.It's too bad.
This is nice work.It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.How are you holding up?
You drinking?No, not a drop. No.Are you getting any work since
you left Klein and Saunders?You mean since I was asked
to leave by you.We are not
getting into this now.I wanna come back, Bernie.We'll see.
Now, do this.I think we're making
great progress.Good work.Elisa.What are you doing in there?Cleaning, huh?Listen, honey.Mr. ""I pee with my hands
on my hips""wants to see us both.<i>""Zelda D. Fuller.""</i>How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?About 10 years, sir.No siblings, Zelda?No, sir.That's not common, is it?
For your people?My mama died after me.After I was born.What does that ""D"" stand for?Delilah, sir.On account of the Bible.Delilah, she betrayed Samson.Lulled him to sleep,
cut his hair.Philistines tortured him,
humiliated him...burned his eyes out.Guess my mama didn't read
the good book close enough.And you...""Elisa Esposito.""Doesn't ""Esposito""
mean orphan?""Our Lady of Sorrows
Orphanage in Putnam.""They found her by the riverin the water.It was you
that found my fingers.Oh!Thanks.Three hours in surgery.They rebuilt
the first phalanx here...sutured the tendons.Don't know if
it's gonna take or not.There was mustard on them.
A paper bag?It was all we had, sir.I answer mostly on account
that she can't talk.She can't? She deaf?Mute, sir.She said she can hear you.All those scars on your neck.That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?She said since she was a baby.Who would do that to a baby?The world is sinful.Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?Well, let me say this upfront.You clean that lab,
you get out.The thing we keep in there
is an affront.Do you know what
an affront is, Zelda?Something offensive.That's right,
and I should know.I dragged that filthy thing...out of the river muck
in South Americaall the way here.And along the way,we didn't get
to like each other much.Now...you may think that thing
looks human.Stands on two legs, right?But we're created
in the Lord's image.You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?I wouldn't know, sir,
what the Lord looks like.Well, it's human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.Or even you.Maybe a little more like me,
I guess.That's all.General Hoyt, thank you
for calling me back, sir.<i>- Feeling better?</i>
- Oh, yes, sir, much better.Pain pills is all.- Close the door.
<i>- You lost two fingers, was it?</i>Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.But I still got my thumb,my trigger,
and my pussy finger.<i>Sounds to me
like you'll do all right then.</i>Yes, sir, that's right.Looking forward
to your visit, sir.Decisions need to be made
about the asset.<i>Flavors
of fruity pies await you.</i><i>Three new locations

- No pancakes?I've been through half the boxes
and I can't find the griddles.- Guess what?
- I made you a cheese and broccoli omelet.How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?What?We're burying a time capsule
at the new school.I wanted to ask you...Do you think we'll all have
jetpacks in the future?Believe it, son.Oh! Bus is here.This is America.Bye, Dad!Finish your omelet,then wash your hands
real good...and come upstairs, sweetie.I kind of like it here.
The kids like the lawn.Plus DC is just half
an hour away, isn't it?It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.You know what I'm thinking?I'm thinking I need a new car.You need a new car, do you?How about a Cadillac, mister?Richard.Oh, Richard!Sweetie, Sweetie?Sweetie, your, um,

Welcome, sir!Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, sir.- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.Good God Almighty!
Is that it?Hell of a lot bigger
than I thought.Ugly as sin.You know, the natives in the
Amazon worshiped it like a god.Doesn't look like
much of a god now, does it?Well, they're primitive, sir.You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.Flowers, fruits,
crap like that.Then they tried
to stop the oil drillwith bows and arrows.That didn't turn out too well.He's bleeding.What happened?It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.""Oxygen osmosis
and dioxide exchange.""What the hell
have we got here, son?This creature, sir...it can alternate between twoentirely separate
breathing mechanisms.- A mudskipper can do that.
- No.Look.You want to put
a man in space.He's gonna have
to endure conditionsthe human body
just wasn't made for.This gives us an edge
against the Soviets.How long can it breathe
outside the water?The reality is, sir,we don't know jack shit
about this thing.Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.Those cockeyed bastards.You know, we let 'em send
a dog up into space,and we get a good laugh.Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up,a Russki,orbiting the planet,
doing God knows what.Who's laughing then?
Khrushchev, that's who.Let him send a dog up into space,
and he laughs.Then he puts a commie
up in space, and he laughs.And then he puts
missiles into Cuba.Have we learned nothing?Sir, we need to
get him back in the water.See, these scientists,
they're like artists, sir.They fall in love
with their plaything.Now, right here, see?Along the middle.This creature has
a thick-jointed cartilagethat separates the primary
and secondary lungs.Am I explaining
this correctly, Bob?Yes, but we have...It makes the X-rays
inconclusive.In principle, sir, yes. But...Now, I believe if we want to
get an edge on the Sovietswe need to vivisect
this thing.- No, no.
- Take it apart,- learn how it works.
- No.No! That would
defeat the purpose.Sir, he's passed out.
Please.Put him in the tank.Let him pressurize.General Hoyt, sir?You cannot,
under any circumstance,kill this creature.Count these stars
with me, son.There are five of them.Means I can do
whatever the hell I want.Now, you want
to plead your case,I'll listen to it.But at the end of the day,
it is my damn decision.So crack the damn thing open,
learn what you can,and close up shop here.Give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.You've done it.Thank you, sir.Now, hurry up
and finish the job, son.Absolutely, sir.<i>Get him out?</i>What are you talking about?No. Absolutely not.Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.We're probably breaking
the law just talking about it.Oh, he's alone? Oh.Does this mean that wheneverwe go to
a Chinese restaurantyou wanna save
every fish in the tank?So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.The loneliest thing
you've ever seen?Well, you just said it right there.
You just said it!You called it a thing.
It's a thing. It's a freak.I can understand you.Calm down. God, calm down.All right,
I will repeat it to you.""What am I?""I move my mouth, like him.""I make no sound, like him.""What does that make me?""All that I am...""all that I've ever been...""brought me here, to him.""See, you're saying ""him.""
It's a ""him"" now.You just hit me!Elisa, let go of me.I'm looking. I'm looking!You've never hit me.""When he looks at me,
the way he looks at me...""He does not know

Just listen to me.I have to go.I'm leaving now
because, Elisa,this is very important to me.This is a second
chance for me.I'm sorry, but I have to go.Oh, God.When I come back,
we just will not talkabout this ever again.Elisa, there's...All right!What are we?
What are you and I?Do you know what we are?
We're nothing!Nothing! We can do nothing!I'm sorry, but this...
this is just...Oh, God, it's not
even human. God!What?Giles.- I've been waiting.
- I know. Sorry.It's okay.We going in?You should have
just mailed the art.No.I want to show it to you
and the team in person.I think it's some
of my best work.And it's green as can be.It's, uh, it's not a good time.
Maybe later.Oh. Well, sure.No problem.What would be a good time
for you, Bernie?You painted that?Yeah.Wowee!You're good.Apparently, not as good
as a photograph.But it is good, isn't it?I couldn't paint
anything like that.Here. On me.For me?Well, we don't get
many like you in here.You seem very educated,
and I like talking to you.The thing is that's...the only reason
that I come in here is...- The conversation.
- And?The pie is mighty fine,
too, isn't it?Yeah, yeah, yeah.It's no key lime,
but it's good.You know, I work alone...and my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.You see, that's part
of doing the job here.It's like being a bartender.You serve people pie.
You listen to their problems.You get to know them.I'd like to get
to know you better.What the hell
are you doing, old man?- Let's sit down.
- Oh. Oh, oh, oh.Hey, no, no, no.Not the counter.
Takeout only.You can't sit there.If you want something,
you order, you take it out.But it's empty.
The... the counter's empty.All reserved, all day.
You don't sit down.Y'all come back now, you hear?You don't need
to talk to them like that.You should go, too.And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.<i>âª So come back to my arms âª</i><i>âª And show me

- ""As the spring recedes.""Let's go.<i>âª There's a summer place âª</i><i>âª Where it may rain or storm âª</i><i>âª Yet I'm safe and warm âª</i>Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.I'm just idling around.And I'm just talking.AM radio, air conditioner,power windows, power brakes,
power steering, power seats.All deluxe interior
appointment choices,143 options.Now, this...- is the Taj Mahal on wheels.
- Hmm.I'm not sure about the green.It's not green,
my friend. Teal.- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?It's a limited edition,
12 coats of paint...polished by hand,all authentic
chrome detailing.Four out of five
successful men in Americadrive a Cadillac.That a fact?This here is the future.And you strike me as a man
who is headed there.- Where?
- Why, the future.You're the man of the future.
You belong in this car.Wow!Sir, that is a...
that is a beautiful car!What can I say?You gotta feel good
driving that, huh?And what a wonderful
shade of green, huh?Teal.Teal.Tomorrow, I'll make
a mean meatloaf.Mmm-hmm.Just for you, extra raisins.So, at 5:00 AM,
I drive my cardown the loading ramp.And the shifts are changing,
and I have...How much time do I have?Five minutes? I'll remember.5:00 AM, five minutes.
Five-five, five-five.So, you're going
to move the cameras, right?And I'm gonna be
synchronizing our watchesjust like they do
in the movies.Oh, God! I'm so proud of you.God! You're not afraid!You are? Very?Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.I think this is some
of my best work.""Michael Parker."" I think
it's a good, trustworthy name.It's a little butch.Yes, age 51.54?You don't have to be rude.57.If I put the hair on,I can pull it off.
I can wear this...or I have...Thor, go. Off, off, off! Go!Or I have this.Now this, I think it says
""working man.""But this, now this says...this says with
the butterscotch tie...This says ""casual,
but still stylish.""So, you like this?
I agree, I agree.I think we're ready.Mr. Strickland!Sally, could you call
Miss Espositoto clean up a spill?You know,
I can't figure it out myself.You're not much to look at...but go figure.I keep thinking about you.When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent...or do you squawk a little?Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty, but...Hmm?I just want you to know...I don't mind those scars.I don't mind that
you can't speak, either.When you come
right down to it...I like it.A lot.It kind of gets me going.I bet I can make you
squawk a little.Hey, honey. You okay?Hurry up.
I wanna be home early.My feet are killing me.We need to delay
the procedure.Knock before
you enter my office.This is urgent!Go back out, knock,then I'll let you in
and we'll talk.That's the protocol.
Follow the protocol.Come in.Would you get the door
for me, please?See? That's the way.
Now, we talk.I need more time.Don't let the fact
that you feel like a losernow that you've let your
competitive tendencies...I'm not competitive!
I don't want an intricate,beautiful thing destroyed!This thing dies...you learn, I leave,
out of here.I settle down.My family settles down
somewhere nice.<i>A real city.</i>This creature
is intelligent...capable of language...of understanding emotions.So are the Soviets, the Gooks.And we still kill them,
don't we?The bottom line is,
this isn't a petting zooand I don't wanna be
in this shit holeany longer than need be.Do you?Bob. Do you?No, I don't.Hey, what are you waiting for?Have you seen Elisa?Come on, Zelda!Did you move
the camera on the loading dock?Is that where
you're taking him?Through the service tunnels?That's very smart.Who do you work for?His water must be kept
at 5 to 8% salinity.Table salt will do.Mix one of these in his water
every three days.Raw protein diet is a must.In five minutes...<i>I'll meet you
at the loading dock.</i><i>The lights will go out...</i><i>so be prepared.</i>Mr. Strickland, sir?Twelve hours to
the vivisection of the asset.And I need your signature
here, please.<i>...this
sudden, clandestine decision</i><i>to station strategic weapons</i><i>for the first time
outside of Soviet soil...</i>Hold it right there.<i>...an unjustified change
in the status quo...</i>""Michael Parker."" Is that you?My whole life.Are you out of your mind?Don't do this, Elisa.
Don't do this!What's that?
What's that vehicle?Gosh, sir, I'm not sure.
It's a laundry van?But it's not scheduled.<i>And finally,</i><i>I call upon
Chairman Khrushchev</i><i>to halt and eliminate...</i><i>this clandestine, reckless,</i><i>and provocative threat
to world peace</i><i>and to stable relations
between our two nations.</i>Sir?- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!- Sir, what do you need me to do?
- Get backup.Step out of the vehicle, sir.Oh, God. I'm not good at this.Out of the vehicle now.
I will not say it again.- Oh, God. Please don't shoot me!
- Get out!Oh, God.
Don't shoot me. Please.What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!Get out now!You have to go. Hurry!Oh, woman,
we're gonna burn in hell.Come on, push.Push!I swear, I'm not
doing this on purpose!Mechanical objects and I
just don't get along!What the...She's waiting for you
at the dock. Go! Now!Who's that man? I think
he just killed someone.Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!Are we ready,
are we ready?He's so beautiful.Did I do that?I'm just not good at this.Move! Move!Come on. No.No!Salt? What are you
talking about, salt?Elisa!There.Israeli Popper.You can smell the magnesium.Russians hate the Jews,but they can't get enough
of their gadgets.How'd they get in here?Forged ID, painted plates,
and so on and so forth.And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, sir.Well, no one has to know.We got 24 hours
before I bounce it up.No, I called it in.You called it in?The moment it happened, I...Mr. Strickland, sir.What is it, Sally?Sir, General Hoyt
is on the phone.<i>That thing was
our space dog, Strickland.</i><i>You know that.</i>Sir, I'm getting it back.I can't be in a negative
frame of mind, sir.<i>So, you're feeling good?</i>Feeling strong.
Getting it back.<i>You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.</i><i>For me, son. For me.</i>That's when you're
planning on releasing him?On the 10th?So, what if the rains
are late?What happens with the canal?All right.What's that?Let me see it.
Is that for me?Yeah, that's good.
Keep that up.Looking like
you don't know anything.Lord help me,
if they ask me if I do.I'm not a good liar.Except to Brewster.It takes a lot of lies
to keep a marriage going.<i>All personnel,</i><i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>Lord! What in the...<i>Attention. All personnel,</i><i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>You done got us
in a world of trouble.My opinion,
we're lookingat a highly-trained
group, sir.I'm thinking,
conceivably, sir,like special forces
or so on and so forth.Red Army Special Forces?Conceivably.And they're highly trained.They were well-financed,
an elite group.Highly efficient, ruthless,
clockwork precision.Infiltration took less
than five minutes, sir.My conservative estimate
is that this wasa strike force
of at least 10 men.<i>My master sends this dress.</i>Have you always been alone?Did you ever have someone?Do you know what
happened to you? Do you?Because I don't. I don't know
what happened to me.I don't know.I look in the mirror and the
only thing that I recognizeare these eyes...in this old man's face.You know, sometimes I think
I was either born too earlyor too late for my life.Maybe we're both just relics.<i>Security
measures have been increased</i><i>to maximum levels.</i><i>Prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i><i>Attention.</i><i>Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.</i>Sir, I've got them.Zelda, Elisa. All right.Here we go.Mmm-hmm.Looks like you two punched out
before the incident.Still.If you know something
about what transpired hereit's your obligation...to report any detail,no matter how small
or trivial it may seem.""Trivial"" means unimportant.I didn't see nothing
out of the ordinary, no.Or trivial.See, my feet were hurting.What about you?She didn't see anything.Mmm.Hoffstetler, Dr. Hoffstetler.Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?He works there, doesn't he?I mean in a different way,
doing something different.Something trivial?No, sir.What am I doing,
interviewing the fucking help?The shit cleaners.The piss wipers.You two, go ahead. Leave.All right, you're clear.
So, back to work. Go on.What'd you say to me?What is she saying?I didn't catch it.What is she saying?She... she is saying thank you.Next!<i>I didn't see you
last night or the night before.</i><i>I'm sorry, Ed,</i><i>but now that I'm spending
all day long in the office,</i><i>Carol feels that I... I should
spend my evenings with her.</i><i>Well, if you
spend the evenings with her,</i><i>when will I?</i><i>There's only
one thing left to do.</i><i>Volunteer.</i>No! No, no, no, no, no!I wanna get home early.Brewster's been in
a bad mood lately.Holy Jesus!What are you doin'
standing in the shadowsof the women's locker room?They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here.For good reason.But have you caught us
at an inconvenient moment!I need to know
that he's alright.- He is.
- When will you release him?Soon.When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.If you need anything...Release him. Soon.What did she say?She said you're a good man,
Dr. Hoffstetler.My name is Dimitri.Honored to meet you.Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.It's urgent.Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.Believe me. I'm fine.He ate Pandora.Wasn't his fault.
He's a wild creature.We can't ask him
to be anything else.Elisa, go find him.Go. Go.Go!You're lucky.Ow.I stayed awake
as long as I could.You know,
I'm not even mad anymore.Is he all right?
You sure?Where you going?No, no.Okay, don't... no, no.Don't... don't play
with the kitties.No, no.Don't play with the kitties.I'm not... I'm not angry.Oh, my!You did that. It's okay.It's... ooh. I don't
think that's sanitary.Enough.Oh, God.Interesting guy.<i>All personnel
prepare to present</i><i>your identity

a promising lead.Really?That's good to hear.You joined us in Galveston,but where were
you before, Hoffstetler?- Doctor.
- Excuse me?Doctor Hoffstetler.Protocol.Wisconsin. Madison.Oh that's right.You gave up a tenure
track position, didn't you?Gave it all up for us.I suppose...you'll be getting ready
to leave us now then, huh?Only if the creature
isn't found.Well, what do you think?You think we will find it?Well, you said
you had a lead.I do.Why you smiling, hon?Stop looking like that.What happened?Why?How?How?Does he have a...?Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm.Oh!Never trust a man.Even when he looks
flat down there.Hmm.<i>You rang?</i><i>Oh, hi, Maynard. I

pouring into my theater!I have four paying customers!
I've got to offer refunds.It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.- You don't fix it, no more rent!
- I will fix it.Elisa?Dear God. Elisa!I'm toweling my hair!It's my hair.Ah, just...Oh! Look at my arm.The wound. It's like
it was never there.Look at that.Now you said that...you know, he was worshiped
like a god.Now, is he a god?
I don't know if he's a god.I mean, he ate a cat,
so I don't... I don't know.I don't know, but, I mean,we have to keep him
around awhile.Little while.Hello?<i>Your water, sir.</i>- And sir, General Hoyt...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.Tell him I'm not here.Tell him I'll call him back.
Don't put him through.No, sir...He... he's in your office.At this point,
our only concern is the asset.- Do you have it?
- Still in the winds, sir.Well, that won't do.Yes, sir, I know.You've known me
how long, sir?Thirteen years.
Battle of Pusan.Yes, sir.A man is faithful,
loyal, efficient all his life.All of it. And he is...useful.And he expects...He has certain
expectations in return.And then, he fails once.Only once.
What does that make him?That make him a failure?When is a man done, sir?Proving himself?A good man?A decent man?""Decent?""A man has the decency
not to fuck up.Now that's one thing.That's real decent of him.But the other kind of decency?It doesn't really matter.Well sell it,

- Where did you take it?- What are you talking about? I... I don't...
- Zelda!The thing in the lab.Where is it?- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!I'm sorry, sir.If I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.That story about Samson.I never told you how it ends.After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.And at the last minute,
he is spared.And the Lord gives him
his strength back...one last time.And he holds...the columns of the temple...with his powerful arms.And he crushes them.And he brings
the whole buildingdown on the Philistines.He dies...but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.That is his will!Now, do you know what that
particular story means...for us, Delilah?It means if you know something
you're not telling meyou're gonna tell meeither before or afterI bring
this particular temple...down upon our heads.Gal stole that
thing right out the lab,whatever it is.Mute girl took it.I heard my wife talking
on the phone about it.Thank you very much,
Mr. Fuller,for your assistance.What have you done?Zelda.I gotta warn her.He's going after her.You will do
no such thing, woman.Why are you worrying about her?She broke the law.Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!Years, you don't talk...and now you can't
shut your mouth!Damn you, Brewster.You wouldn't understand.Couldn't understand, not if
you tried your whole life.<i>- Hello?</i>

The Godfather|1972|98|Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall|Francis Ford Coppola|"I believe in America.America has made my fortune.And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.I gave her freedom, but I taught
her never to dishonor her family.She found a boyfriend,
not an Italian.She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.I didn't protest.Two months ago he took her for a
drive with another boyfriend.They made her drink whiskeyand then they tried to
take advantage of her.She resisted, she
kept her honor.So they beat her like an animal.When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.But I wept. Why did I weep?She was the light of my life.Beautiful girl.Now she will never
be beautiful again.Sorry.I went to the police,
like a good American.These two boys were
brought to trial.The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,but suspended the sentence.Suspended the sentence! They
went free that very day!I stood in the
courtroom like a fool.Those two bastards,
they smiled at me.Then I said to my wife, ""For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone.""Why did you go to the police? Why
didn't you come to me first?What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.What is that?I want them dead.That I cannot do.I'll give you anything you ask.I've known you many years, but this is
the first time you've asked for help.I can't remember the last time you
invited me for a cup of coffee.Even though my wife is
godmother to your only child.But let's be Frank here. You
never wanted my friendship.And you were afraid
to be in my debt.I didn't want to
get into trouble.I understand.You found Paradise in America.You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.You didn't need a
friend like me.But now you come to me and say,""Don Corleone, give me justice.""But you don't ask with respect.You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.I ask you for justice.That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.Let them suffer, then,
as she suffers.How much shall I pay you?Bonasera, Bonasera.What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?If you'd come in friendship,the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.And then they would fear you.Be my friend?Godfather?Good.Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.But until that dayaccept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.- GrÃ zie, Godfather.
- Prego.Give this to Clemenza.I want people that aren't
going to get carried away.We're not murderers, in spite
of what this undertaker says.- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.We're not taking the
picture without Michael.- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.Don Barzini.Hey, Paulie! Let
me have some wine.Paulie! More wine.- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?Take a walk and do your job.Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.You watch yourself, all right?20, 30 grand. In
small bills, cash.In that little silk purse.If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!Hey, Paulie!I got two gabagool,
capocol, and a prosciut.Stupid jerk!What's the matter?- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.Get out of here! It's a
private party. Go on!What is it? It's my
sister's wedding.Goddamn FBI don't
respect nothing!Come here, come here, come here!But towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,so for six months he's
worked in my pastry shop.Nazorine, what can I do for you?Now that the war is over,this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.You understand everything.Mr. Hagen. Thank you.Wait till you see the wedding
cake I made for your daughter!The bride, the groom
and the angel...- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.Give it to a Jew Congressman
in another district.Who else is on the list?Hey, Michael!He's not on the list, but
Luca Brasi wants to see you.Is this necessary?He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited meon the wedding day
of your daughter.May their first child
be a masculine child.Michael...That man over there is
talking to himself.See that scary guy over there?- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?His name is Luca Brasi. He
helps my father out sometimes.Michael, he's coming over here!You look terrific!My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.Your father's been
asking for you.- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.Why does your brother
have a different name?My brother Sonny found
Tom Hagen in the street.He had no home, so my
father took him in.He's been with us ever since.He's a good lawyer.Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.- What's that?
- That's a,like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.You like your lasagna?Don Corleone.I'm honored and gratefulthat you have invited me to
your daughter's wedding.On the day of your
daughter's wedding.And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.Thank you.Signora Corleone!No!Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.What is that outside?Johnny! Johnny!I love you!He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!You never said you
knew Johnny Fontane!- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?How?- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...Please, Michael. Tell me.When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contractwith a big bandleader.And as his career got better and
better, he wanted to get out of it.Johnny is my father's godson.My father went to see
this bandleader.He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,but the bandleader said no.So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.Within an hour,he signed a release for a
certified check of $ 1,000.- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.That's a true story.That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.Beautiful!I'll take care of it.Tom...I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.How are you, Fredo?My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.- Hi.
- How are you doing?- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?Yeah. This is your friend?I don't know what to do. My
voice is weak. It's weak.Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.But this... man won't give it
to me, the head of the studio.- What's his name?
- Woltz.He won't give it to me, and
he says there's no chance.Sonny?Sonny?Sonny?- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?The old man wants you.One minute.A month ago he bought the movie
rights to this book, a best-seller.The main character is
a guy just like me.I wouldn't even have to act.Godfather, I don't
know what to do.You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?""What can I do? What can I
do?"" What is that nonsense?Ridiculous.- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.Good.Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.You look terrible.
I want you to eat.Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.It's too late, they start
shooting in a week.I'm going to make him an
offer he can't refuse.Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.Do we give your son-in-law
something important?Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.Carlo, we're going
to take the picture.Wait a minute.No, Michael. Not me.Okay, that's it. Just like that.
Hold it!- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.This friend would give his
friendship to Mr. Woltz,if Mr. Woltz would
grant us a favor.Woltz is listening.Give Johnny the part in that war
film you're starting next week.And what favor would your
friend grant Mr. Woltz?He could make your future
union problems disappear.And one of your stars has just
moved from marijuana to heroin.Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!Let me lay it on the line.Johnny Fontane will
never get that movie!No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?I have a special practice.
I handle one client.I'll wait for your call.By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.Check him out.- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.- It used to decorate a King's palace.
- Very nice.Why didn't you say you
work for Corleone?I thought you were some cheap
hustler Johnny was running in.- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.You do appreciate
beauty, don't you?There you are. $600,000
on four hoofs.I bet Russian czars never
paid that for a single horse.Khartoum.Khartoum.I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.Thanks, Tony.Let's get something to eat.Corleone is Johnny's godfather.To the Italian people that's a
very sacred, close relationship.I respect it. Tell him
to ask me anything else.This favor I can't give him.He never asks a second favor when
he's been refused the first.You don't understand. Johnny
Fontane never gets that movie.That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.I'm going to run him out of the
business, and let me tell you why.Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protÃ©gÃ©s.We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.Let me be even more Frank.To show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man.That it's not all
dollars and cents.She was beautiful. She
was young and innocent!She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.And she runs off.She threw it all away just
to make me look ridiculous!And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!You get the hell out of here!If that goombah tries any rough
stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader.Yeah, I heard that story.Thank you for dinner and
a very pleasant evening.Maybe your car can take
me to the airport.Mr. Corleone insists on
hearing bad news immediately.- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.I have the Sollozzo notes here.Now...Sollozzo is known as The Turk.He's supposed to be
very good with a knife,but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.His business is narcotics.He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.In Sicily he has plants to
process them into heroin.He needs cash, he needs
protection from the police.He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.He's known as a top
narcotics man.- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.Tom?Yes. There's more money in
narcotics than anything else.If we don't get into it, somebody
else will, maybe the five families.With that money they can buy
more police and political power.Then they come after us.Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?Don Corleone.I need a man who has
powerful friends.I need a million
dollars in cash.I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.In the first year your end should
be three, four million dollars.And then it would go up.And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?My compliments.I'll take care of them,
out of my share.So I receive 30% for finance,political influence
and legal protection?That's right.Why do you come to me? Why do
I deserve this generosity?If you consider a million
dollars in cash just finance,te salud Don Corleone.I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,to be treated with respect.But, I must say no to you.And I'll give you my reason.It's true, I have a lot
of friends in politics.They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.It doesn't make any difference to
me what a man does for a living.But your business is...
a little dangerous.If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.I have a sentimental weakness for
my children, and I spoil them.They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish
to congratulate you on your new business.I know you'll do
well, and good luck.Especially since your interests don't
conflict with mine. Thank you.Santino.Come here.What's the matter with you?Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.Go on.Tom, what's this nonsense?It's from Johnny. He's
starring in that new film.- Take it away.
- Take it over there.Andtell Luca Brasi to come in.I'm a little worried about
this Sollozzo fellow.Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.Go to the Tattaglias.Make them think that you're
not too happy with our familyand find out what you can.I got something for your
mother and for Sonnyand a tie for Freddy, and Tom
Hagen got the Reynolds pen.- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.Andiamo, Fredo.- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.I'll have to get it myself. Paulie
called in sick this morning.Paulie's a good kid. I don't
mind getting the car.Buon natale, Caro. GrÃ zie.- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.You know who I am?I know you.You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?I think you and I
can do business.I need someone strong like you.I heard you are not happy...with the Corleone family.Want to join me?What's in it for me?$50,000 to start with.Not bad!Agreed?Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.Make time, Consigliere.
Get in the car.What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.Get in.- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.Merry Christmas. I
want some fruit.Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Like in the story.No.- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.Michael.No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.What's the matter?They don't say if
he's dead or alive.- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?No. Look, come home, kid. You
should be with Mama, you hear?Oh, my God.Sonny!Stay back there.- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.There's more news
about your old man.Word is out that
he's already dead.- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.- How often?
- Only three, four times.- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.I don't care how sick he is. Bring
him to my father's house right now.- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.I'm going to have a couple of our
people come over to the house.- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.In three hours he'll be
released with our proposition.Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.What's done is done. Don't lose
that famous temper of yours, Sonny.I'll wait.Your boss is dead.I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.I want you to help the
Corleones and me.We got him outside his office about
an hour after we picked you up.Drink it.It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.Sonny was hot for
my deal, wasn't he?And you knew it was the
right thing to do.- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don rest in peace was slipping.Ten years ago, could I
have gotten to him?Well, now he's dead, Tom, and
nothing can bring him back.You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.It's good business, Tom.I'll try. But even Sonny won't
be able to call off Luca Brasi.Yeah, well...Let me worry about Luca.You just talk to Sonny.And the other two kids.- I'll do my best.
- Good.Now you can go.I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.Blood is a big expense.He's still alive.They hit him with five
shots, and he's still alive!That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.Your mother is at the
hospital with your father.Looks like he'll pull through.It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.What about Luca? Sollozzo
thinks he can control him.If Luca sold out, we're
in a lot of trouble.- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.This is almost 1946. Nobody
wants bloodshed anymore.If your father diesyou make the deal.- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.What is it?- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.Tessio, go see what it is.- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.Hanging around the house on the
phone would be a big help.Try Luca again.- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.- I'm going.
- When will you be home?Probably late.- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.We have to find a spot on the West Side.
Try 309 West 43rd Street.- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.Think while you're driving. I
want to hit New York this month.Watch the kids.Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.Yeah, all right.Make sure they're clean, because the
guys will be there a long time.- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.Exterminate! Watch out, so
we don't exterminate you!Pull over. I've got
to take a leak.Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!- Yeah.
- Phone call!- Who is it?
- Some girl.- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?He's going to make it.I love you.I love you!- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.Can't you say it?I'll see you tonight.Why don't you tell that
nice girl you love her?I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.You start with a little
oil, then fry some garlic.Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.Add a little bit of wine.And a little bit of sugar.
That's my trick.Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?You won't see him no more.- Where are you going?
- To the city.- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...He'll be all right. Sollozzo
knows he's a civilian.- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.Send somebody with him anyway.- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?No, Kay. There will be detectives
there, people from the press.I'll wait in the cab.I don't want you
to get involved.When will I see you again?Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.What are you doing here? You're
not supposed to be here.I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.What happened to the guards?Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.Get me Long Beach 45620, please.Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got
here late, there's nobody here.No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody.
Papa's all alone.- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.I'm sorry, but you
will have to leave.We're going to move
him to another room.Can you disconnect the tubes?- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?Help me, please.- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the Baker.- Remember me?
- Enzo.You'd better go, there's
going to be trouble.If there is trouble, I'll stay
here to help you. For your father.Listen. Wait for me outside, in
front of the hospital, all right?I'll be out in a minute.Just lie here, Pop. I'll
take care of you now.I'm with you now.I'm with you.Get rid of these. Come here.Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun.You'll be all right.You did good.I thought all you Guinea
hoods were locked up!- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.Stand him up straight.I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.They're licensed
to carry firearms.If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show 'cause.Let him go.- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.After the hospital
thing, Sonny got mad.We hit Bruno Tattaglia
this morning.Jesus Christ.Looks like a fortress
around here.Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead.Mike, let me look at you.You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?What did he say... He wants us to
send Michael to hear the proposition.He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.No more! Not this
time, Consigliere.No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.I want Sollozzo,
or we go to war...- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!This is business, not personal!- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.No more advice on how to patch things up.
Just help me win.I found out about Captain
McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.McCluskey has agreed to
be The Turk's bodyguard.So when Sollozzo is being
guarded, he's invulnerable.Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.Do me a favor. Take this
into consideration.All right, we'll wait.We can't wait. We can't wait.No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?They want to have a
meeting with me, right?It will be me, McCluskey
and Sollozzo.Let's set the meeting.Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.Some place where there are
people, so I feel safe.They'll search me when
I meet them, right?So I can't have a weapon on me.But if Clemenza can figure out a way
to have a weapon planted there for methen I'll kill them both.Nice college boy. Didn't want to get
mixed up in the family business.Now you want to shoot a police
captain because he slapped you?This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.You're taking this
very personal.Tom, this is business and
he's taking it personal.- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...I'm talking about a cop who's mixed
up in drugs, a dishonest cop.A cop who got mixed up in the
rackets and got what was coming.That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?- They might like a story like that.
- They might.It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.It's as cold as they come.Impossible to trace, so you
don't worry about prints.I put a special tape on the
trigger and the butt. Try it.Is the trigger too tight?My ears!I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.Let your hand drop to your
side and let the gun slip out.Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,so walk out fast, but don't run.Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.They'll be scared stiff, so
don't worry about nothing.You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,and we'll catch the hell.- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.All the other families will
probably line up against us.These things have to happen
every five, 10 years.Gets rid of the bad blood.Been 10 years since the last one. You
have to stop them at the beginning.Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.You know, Mike, we were all proud of you.
Being a hero and all.Your father too.Nothing. Not a hint.
Absolutely nothing.Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.How much time do we have?They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.Sollozzo might not even
be in the car, Sonny!I'll get it.Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.A police captain is on call 24 hours a day.
He'll be there between 8 and 10.- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.All right. Mike, you
go to the restaurant,you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.I want somebody very
good to plant that gun.I don't want him coming
out with just his dick.- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.Let's move.Did he tell you to drop
the gun right away?Yeah, a million times.Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.How long do you think it will
be before I can come back?At least a year.I'll square it with Mom, that you're
not seeing her before you leave and...I'll get a message to that
girlfriend when the time is right.Take care.Take care, Mike.I'm glad you came. I hope we
can straighten everything out.It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.I want to straighten everything out. I
don't want my father bothered again.I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.But you have to keep an
open mind when we talk.I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.He's a good kid.I'm sorry about the
other night, Mike.I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.He's clean.Going to Jersey?Maybe.Nice work, Lou.- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.I'll have it.- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.What I want...What's most important to meis that I have a guarantee. No
more attempts on my father's life.What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!I missed my chance. You
think too much of me, kid.I'm not that clever.All I want is a truce.I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?When you got to go,
you got to go.He's clean.Don't take too long.I've frisked a thousand punks.Okay, you take over.I love you, Grandpa.I'm sorry, Pa. He
doesn't know you yet.- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay."" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank.""Go with your mother.Take them downstairs.Go on, Carlo, you too.Go on.- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.They hit us, so
we hit them back.Through our newspaper contacts we've
been able to put out materialabout McCluskey's link with
Sollozzo in the drug rackets.So things are loosening up.And I'm sending
Fredo to Las Vegas,under the protection of
Don Francesco of L.A.- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.Where's Michael?It was Michael who
killed Sollozzo.But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back.I want you to find out where that
old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.I want him now.Sonny, things are
starting to loosen up.If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!Pop had Genco. Look what I got.I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.Ma made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.That's because they've
started making big money.Papa never talked
business at the table.- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.Don't interfere.I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...We don't discuss
business at the table.I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.Why are you so far
from the house?You know I'm responsible to
your father for your life.The bodyguards are here.It's still dangerous...We've heard from
Santino in New York...Your enemies know you're here.Did Santino say
when I can go back?Not yet.It's out of the question.Where are you going now?To Corleone.Take my car.I want to walk.Be careful.Where have all the men gone?They're all dead from vendettas.There are the names of the dead.Hey, hey, take me to
the America, G.I.!Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable!America! Take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!Mamma Mia what a beauty.I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.Did you have a good hunt?You know all the
girls around here?We saw some real beauties.One of them struck our
friend like a thunderbolt.She would tempt the
devil himself.Really put together.Right, Calo?Such hair, such mouth!The girls around here are beautiful...
but virtuous.This one had a purple dress...And a purple ribbon in her hair.A type more Greek than Italian.Do you know her?There's no girl like
that in this town.My God, I understand!What's wrong?Let's go.It's his daughter.Tell him to come here.Call him.Fabrizio, you translate.I apologize if I offended you.I'm a stranger in this country.I meant no disrespect to
you or your daughter.I'm an American,
hiding in Sicily.My name is Michael Corleone.There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.But then your daughter
would lose a fatherinstead of gaining a husband.I want to meet your daughter.With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.With all respect.Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.What's her name?I'll knock you dizzy.Save it for the library.We've got to pick up my sister.What's the matter?What's the matter?- It was my fault!
- Where is he?It was my fault. I hit him.I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...I'm just going to get a
doctor to take a look at you.Sonny, please don't do anything.What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?You spic slobs still
betting Yankees?Tell them to stop
taking in action.We lost enough money last week.Come here, come here!If you touch my sister
again, I'll kill you.Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.Yes, I have. I've tried
writing and calling.- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.All we know is that
he's all right.- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.Tom, will you give this
letter to Michael. Please?If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.He'll get in touch with you.I let my cab go, so can I
call another one, please?Come on. Sorry.- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.Tell him that I can't make
it tonight until later.Bitch!- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!I'll vafangool you!She has a filthy mouth,
this Guinea brat.That's it, break it all, you
spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!Why don't you bring your
whore home for dinner?Maybe I will.- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up!
Clean it up!Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!Clean it up. Clean
that up, you...Clean it!Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be
a murderer, like your father!- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!Come on, kill me!Get out of here!- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.You Guinea brat.
Get out of here!Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.Connie, talk louder.
The baby's crying.Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.Yeah, Connie.You wait there.No, you just wait there.Son-of-a-bitch.- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.Sonny!- Sonny.
- Get out of here!Go after him, go on!Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!Give me a drop.My wife is crying upstairs.I hear cars coming to the house.Consigliere of mine,tell your Don what
everyone seems to know.I didn't tell Mama anything.I was about to come up and
wake you and tell you.But you needed a drink first.Yeah.Well, now you've had your drink.They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.I want no inquiries made.I want no acts of vengeance.I want you to arrange a meetingwith the heads of
the five families.This war stops now.Call Bonasera.I need him now.This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.You owe your Don a service.He has no doubt that
you will repay it.He will be at your funeral
parlor in one hour.Be there to greet him.Well, my friend, are you
ready to do me this service?Yes. What do you want me to do?I want you to use all your
powers and all your skills.I don't want his mother
to see him this way.Look how they massacred my boy.It's safer to teach you English!I know English...Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.Greetings, Don Tommasino.How are things in Palermo?Michael is teaching me to drive...
watch, I'll show you.How are things in Palermo?Young people don't respect
anything anymore...times are changing
for the worse.This place has become
too dangerous for you.I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.What's wrong?Bad news from America.Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.Let's go... you promised.Fabrizio!Get the car.Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?No, take her to her father's
house until things are safe.Okay, anything you say.Calo, where is Apollonia?She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.She'll make a good
American wife.Wait, I'll get the baggage.Fabrizio!Where are you going?Wait there! I'll drive to you.No, Apollonia!Don Barzini, I want to thank you for
helping me organize this meeting,and the other heads of the five
families from New York and New Jersey.Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,and from BrooklynPhilip Tattaglia.And from Staten Islandwe have with us Victor Strachi.And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas Cityand all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.How did things ever get so far?I don't know.It was so unfortunate,
so unnecessary.Tattaglia lost a son,
and I lost a son.We're quits. And if
Tattaglia agrees,then I'm willing to let
things go on as before.We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.Yes, Don Barzini.
He's too modest.He had all the judges and
politicians in his pocket.He refused to share them.When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?All of you know me.When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.It's not like gambling
or liquor or even women,which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other thingsare going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.I believed that then and
I believe that now.Times have changed.It's not like the old days, when
we could do anything we wanted.A refusal is not the
act of a friend.If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share themor let others use them. He must let
us draw the water from the well.Certainly he can present a
bill for such services.After all, we're not communists.I also don't believe in drugs.For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.Somebody says to them
"" I have powders."""" If you put up 3-4,000
dollar investment,we can make 50,000
distributing.""They can't resist. I want to control
it as a business, keep it respectable.I don't want it near schools, I
don't want it sold to children.Thats an infÃ mia.In my city we would keep the
traffic to the colored.They're animals, so let
them lose their souls.I hoped that we could come
here and reason together.And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.I must have strict
assurance from Corleone.As time goes by and his
position becomes stronger,will he attempt any
individual vendetta?We are all reasonable men. We
don't have to give assurances.You talk about vengeance.Will vengeance bring
your son back to you?Or my boy to me?I forgo the vengeance of my son.But I have selfish reasons.My youngest son was forced
to leave this countrybecause of this
Sollozzo business.And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.Cleared of all these
false charges.But I'm a superstitious man.If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,or if he should hang
himself in his jail cell,or if he's struck by
a bolt of lightning,then I'm going to blame some
of the people in this room.And that I do not forgive.But, that asidelet me say that I swearon the souls of
my grandchildren,that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?Mention it. Don't insist.- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.Tattaglia's a pimp.He could never have
outfought Santino.But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.Come on, Nancy.Keep together, everyone. Brian.Okay, all right.How long have you been back?I've been back a year.Longer than that, I think.It's good to see you, Kay.I'm working for my
father now, Kay.He's been sick. Very sick.But you're not like him.You told me you weren't going
to become like your father.My father is no different
than any other powerful man.Any man who's responsible
for other people.Like a senator or president.- How naive you sound.
- Why?They don't have men killed.Who's being naive, Kay?My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.In five years the Corleone family is
going to be completely legitimate.Trust me. That's all I can tell
you about my business. Kay...Michael, why did you come here?
Why?What do you want with
me after all this time?I've been calling and writing.I came because I need you.
I care for you.- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...I'll do anything you ask to make
up for what's happened to us.Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is thatwe have each other. That
we have a life together.That we have children.
Our children.Kay, I need you.And I love you.Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.Don Corleone...You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.Michael is now head
of the family.If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.After we make the move to Nevadayou can leave the Corleone
family and go on your own.- How long will that be?
- Six months.Forgive me, but with you gone,me and Pete will come
under Barzini's thumb.I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.That's all I can tell you now.Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.That's no reflection on
Tom, just how I want it.If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.Mike... Why am I out?You're not a wartime
consigliere, Tom.Things may get rough
with the move.Tom.I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.I thought Santino was a
bad Don, rest in peace.Michael has all my
confidence, just as you do.But there are reasons why you must have
no part in what is going to happen.- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.I can't get over the way
your face looks. So good!This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!Leave them out here. He's
tired and wants to clean up.Let me open the door, all right?- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?I'll be right back.
Keep them occupied.- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.I'm tired. Get rid
of the band too.Hey, take off. Take off.
Let's go.Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.Hey, come on! Scram!Come on, honey. I don't know what's
the matter with him, Johnny.Sorry.I don't know. He's tired.What happened to Moe Greene?He had some business. He said to give
him a call when the party started.Well, give him a call.- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.Well, I owe it all to him.He knows how grateful you are.That's why he'd like
to ask a favor of you.Mike, what can I do?We're thinking of
giving up our interestsin the olive oil business
and settling here.Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.- Tom!
- Are you sure?Moe loves the business. He never
said nothing about selling.I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.See, Johnny...We figure that entertainment would
draw gamblers to the casino.We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.We're counting on you.Sure, Mike. I'll do
anything for my godfather.Good.Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?Have everything? Specially prepared food,
the best dancers, and good credit.Draw chips for everybody, so
they can play on the house.Is my credit good
enough to buy you out?Buy me out?The casino, the hotel.The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.The Corleone family wants to buy me out?
No, I buy you out.Your casino loses money.
We can do better.- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.You Guineas make me laugh.I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!You did that because we
bankrolled your casinoand the Molinari family
guaranteed his safety.Let's talk business.Yes. First of all,
you're all done.You don't have that
kind of muscle anymore.The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.Do you think you can come
to my hotel and take over?I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!Is that why you slapped my
brother around in public?That was nothing, Mike. Moe
didn't mean nothing by that.He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.I have a business to run. I've
got to kick asses sometimes.We had an argument, so I
had to straighten him out.You straightened my brother out?He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.What's wrong with you?I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.Son-of-a-bitch!I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when
you were out with cheerleaders.Wait a minute, Moe.
I have an idea.Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.If you have anything to
say, say it to Michael.Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!Fredo...You're my older brother,
and I love you.But don't ever take sides with
anyone against the family again.Ever.I have to see my father and his
people, so have dinner without me.This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.Your sister wants to
ask you something.- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.They want you to be
godfather to their boy.- We'll see.
- Will you?Let me think about it. Come on.Barzini will move
against you first.He'll set up a meeting with
someone you absolutely trust.Guaranteeing your safety.And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.I like to drink wine
more than I used to.- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.I don't know.Are you happy with your
wife and children?- Very happy.
- That's good.I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.I spend my life trying
not to be careless.Women and children can be
careless, but not men.- How's your boy?
- He's good.He looks more like
you every day.He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.Read the funny papers.I want you to arrange for a telephone man
to check all in-and out-going calls.I did it already. I
took care of that, Pop.That's right. I forgot.What's the matter?What's bothering you?I'll handle it. I told you I can
handle it, so I'll handle it.I knew that Santino would
have to go through all this.And Fredo...Fredo was, well...But I never wanted this for you.I worked my whole life. I don't
apologize for taking care of my family.And I refused to be a fool,dancing on a string held
by all those big shots.I don't apologize. That's my
life, but I thought that,that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.Another pezzonovante.Well...Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.We'll get there, Pop.
We'll get there.Now listen, whoever comes to
you with this Barzini meeting,he's the traitor.
Don't forget that.Can I hold it, please?- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.Over here, over here.Be careful. You're spilling it.Anthony!Come here, come here.That's it. We'll put
it right there.I'll show you something.
Come here.Stand there.Give me an orange!That's a new trick.You run in there. Run in there.Where are you?Mike, can I have a minute?Barzini wants to
arrange a meeting.He says we can straighten
out any of our problems.- You talked to him?
- Yeah.I can arrange security.
On my territory.- All right?
- All right.Do you know how they're
going to come at you?They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.
Tessio's ground.Where I'll be safe.I always thought it would
be Clemenza, not Tessio.It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.But I'm going to wait.After the baptism.I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.And then I'll meet with Don
Barzini and Tattaglia.All the heads of
the five families.Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?I do.Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?I do.Do you believe in the Holy
Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?I do.Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?I do renounce him.And all his works?I do renounce them.Oh, God!- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.Michael Rizzi, will
you be baptized?I will.Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and
may the Lord be with you. Amen.Kay!Kiss your godfather.Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.Everybody has to
leave without us.- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.I'll only be a couple of days.We're on our way to Brooklyn.- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.I can't go either, Sal.Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.Tom, can you get
me off the hook?- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.That little farce you
played with my sister.- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.Don't do this to me, please.Barzini is dead.So is Philip Tattaglia.Moe Greene.Strachi. Cuneo.Today I settle all family business, so
don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.Admit what you did.Get him a drink.Come on.Don't be afraid, Carlo.Do you think I'd make
my sister a widow?I'm godfather to
your son, Carlo.Go ahead, drink, drink.No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.You're finished. I'm putting
you on a plane to Vegas.Tom.I want you to stay there.
Understand?Only don't tell me
you're innocent.Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.Who approached you?Tattaglia or Barzini?It was Barzini.Good.There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.I'll call your wife and tell
her what flight you're on.- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.Hello, Carlo.- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!Michael!- What is it?
- Where is he?Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?Connie.Why do you think he
kept Carlo at the Mall?He knew he was
going to kill him.And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!That's your husband,
that's your husband!No! No, no...Take her upstairs.
Get her a doctor.She's hysterical.Hysterical.Michael, is it true?- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!All right.This one time.This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.Is it true?Is it?No.I guess we both need a drink.
Come on.Don Corleone."
Casablanca|1942|98|Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid|Michael Curtiz|"With the coming
of the Second World War......many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately......toward the freedom of the Americas.Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.Paris to Marseilles......across the Mediterranean to Oran.Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa......to Casablanca in French Morocco.Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck......might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.And from Lisbon to the New World.But the others wait in Casablanca.And wait and wait......and wait.To all officers:Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.Important.May we see your papers?I don't think I have them on me.- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...Yes. Here they are.These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.Halt!Halt!- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?We hear very little,
and we understand even less.Two German couriers were found murdered
in the desert. The unoccupied desert.This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals......and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.This place is full of vultures.Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.What an amusing little fellow.Waiter.- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?I've left my wallet in the hotel.Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.Thank you, thank you.May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.That is kind of you.You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.- Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
- What else?The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.- But we know already who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.I've already heard about this cafÃ©.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.Waiting, waiting, waiting.I'll never get out of here.I'll die in Casablanca.But can't you make it just a little more?Please?Sorry, but diamonds are a drug
on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.All right.The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--It's the fishing smack Santiago.It leaves at 1 tomorrow night,
here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.Remember, in cash.Cheerio.- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?Perhaps if you told him I ran the
second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.We have something
to look forward to.And his father is the bellboy.Excuse me.I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.Of all the nerve. Who do you think--?
I know there is gambling in there.- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.Your cash is good at the bar.What? Do you know who I am?I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.You know, watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.- But when you first came, I thought--
- You thought what?What right do I have to think?May I?Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks......today they are the honored dead.You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.I forgive you.- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.I forgot, you never drink with--
I'll have another, please.You despise me, don't you?If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.But why?Do you object to the kind of business I do?But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot in this place if I didn't help them.That's not so bad. Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.For a price, Ugarte. For a price.But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.Look, Rick.Know what this is?Something that even you have never seen.Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.One moment.Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.And then, addio, Casablanca.I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow, just because you despise me......you are the only one I trust.Will you keep these for me, please?- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.Please keep them for me.Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.Rick......I hope you're more impressed
with me now.If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.Just a moment.I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.How's business at the Blue Parrot?- Fine, but I'd like to buy your cafÃ©.
- It's not for sale.- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.In refugees alone we could make a fortune,
if you'd work with me in the black market.Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.Suppose we do.When will you realize that in this world today
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.Oh, I like it fine here.- He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.Sorry.The boss's private stock...- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?Where were you last night?That's so long ago,
I don't remember.- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.Give me another.- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.- Rick, I'm tired of having you--
- Sascha, call a cab.- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.Hey, taxi.Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.And come right back.Yes, boss.- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.Someday they may be scarce.I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.Maybe get her on the rebound.When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.The plane to Lisbon.You would like to be on it?Why? What's in Lisbon?The clipper to America.I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.It's a combination of all three.And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.I was misinformed.Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs......and the cashier
would like some money.I'll get it from the safe.I'm so upset, Rick. You know I--Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.I'm awfully sorry.Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your cafÃ©.- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.A murderer, no less.If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.It will amuse your customers.Our entertainment's enough.We're to have an important guest
here tonight.Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.- Perhaps not.
- Here.- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.How observant you are.As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.Yeah?- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.There are many exit visas sold in this cafÃ©,
but we know that you've never sold one.That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.That is another reason.There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.Victor Laszlo?Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.- Manages what?
- His escape.- But I just told you--
- Stop it.He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.This is the end of the chase.Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.Is that a serious offer?I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.- Okay.
- Done.No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran......he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell......you are at heart a sentimentalist.Laugh if you will,
but I happen to be familiar with your record.Let me point out just two items:In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.And got well paid for it on both occasions.The winning side would
have paid you much better.Maybe.It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.I have my orders.I see. Gestapo spank.My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.- I am--
- Major Strasser is here, sir.- You were saying?
- Excuse me.Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.I have already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.Very well, sir.- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.I expected no less, captain.Monsieur Ugarte.- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.May I first please cash my chips?Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.Rick! Rick, help me!- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!Excellent, captain.When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.I stick my neck out for nobody.I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.Please join us, Mr. Rick.We are very honored tonight.Major Strasser is one of the reasons
the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.You repeat Third Reich
as though you expected there to be others.Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.There seems to be no secret about that.Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?It's not particularly my beloved Paris.Can you imagine us in London?When you get there, ask me.Diplomatist.How about New York?Well, there are sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.""Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country.""The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.Are my eyes really brown?You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is......an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca......and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers......until the day we marched in.And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.Good evening, Mr. Blaine.You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.Perhaps.- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.Two Cointreaux, please.I saw no one of Ugarte's description.Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the cafÃ©.Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.The ring is quite unique.- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.What is your name?Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I'm sorry, it is.- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.Yes, what is it you want?Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.I was told you were the most
beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.That was a gross understatement.You're very kind.- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...Somewhere I've seen him.- Sam?
- Yes.He came from Paris with Rick.Rick? Who is he?- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman......and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.But what a fool I am talking
to a beautiful woman about another man.Excuse me.Major.Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.How do you do?This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.I should like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.This is hardly the time or place.Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.With mademoiselle.Captain, I am under your authority.Is it your order
that we come to your office?Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.Very well.A very clever tactical retreat, major.- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?I must find out what Berger knows.- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?Champagne cocktail, please.I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.As you see,
it was true every single time.Thank heaven I found you, Berger.I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.Ugarte cannot even help himself.He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.I see.But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.Underground, like everywhere else.Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.If you will come--Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?Very well, mademoiselle.- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.Too bad you weren't here earlier. We had
quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.I never expected to see you again.It's been a long time.Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.Where is Rick?I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--He went home.- Does he always leave so early?
- He never--Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.Goes up there all the time.You used to be a much better liar, Sam.Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.I don't know what you mean,
Miss Ilsa.Play it, Sam.Play ""As Time Goes By.""I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.I'll hum it for you.Sing it, Sam.Sam, I thought I told you never to play--Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present--- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also--This is Mr. Laszlo.- How do you do?
- How do you do?One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never--- Thanks, I will.
- Well......a precedent is being broken. Emile.- Interesting cafÃ©. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.- What for?
- Your work.Thank you. I try.We all try. You succeed.She was asking about you earlier, Rick,
in a way that made me extremely jealous.I wasn't sure you were the same.- Let's see, the last time we met--
- Was La Belle Aurore.How nice. You remembered.But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.Not an easy day to forget.I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.Yes. I put that dress away.When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police......to be found drinking after hours.- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.- We'll come again.
- Anytime.- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.There's still nobody in the world
who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam.He hasn't played it in a long time.- Good night.
- Good night.Night.A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.- Good night.
- Good night.Boss?- Boss?
- Yeah?- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?- You ever going to bed?
- No.Well, I ain't sleepy, either.Good, then have a drink.- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.Boss, let's get out of here.No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.We'll take the car and drive all night.We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.- Sam.
- Yes, boss?If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?What?My watch stopped.I bet they're asleep in New York.I bet they're asleep all over America.Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world......she walks into mine.- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.You played it for her.
You can play it for me.- I don't think I can remember--
- If she can stand it, I can.Play it.Yes, boss.Who are you really?
And what were you before?What did you do,
and what did you think?We said no questions.Here's looking at you, kid.A franc for your thoughts.In America they'd bring only a penny.I guess that's about all they're worth.I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.Well, I was wondering...Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.Why there is no other man in my life?That's easy.
There was.He's dead.I'm sorry for asking.I forgot we said no questions.Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.Says he'll water his garden with champagne
before he'll let the Germans drink it.This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?You said it.Here's looking at you, kid.My German's a little rusty.It's the Gestapo.They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.It's pretty bad timing.- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?Let's see.Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?Looking for a job.Was that cannon fire?Or is it my heart pounding?It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.And getting closer every minute.Here, here, drink up.We'll never finish the other three.Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.It's strange.- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.No, we must leave.Yes, of course. We.The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.Not at my hotel. I...I have things to do in the city
before I leave.I'll meet you at the station.All right, at a quarter to 5.Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?That's too far ahead to plan.Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that--Hey, what's wrong, kid?I love you so much.And I hate this war so much.It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.If you shouldn't get away...If something should keep us apart......wherever they put you......and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...Kiss me.Kiss me as if it were the last time.Where is she?
Have you seen her?I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.But this note came just after you left.That's the last call, Mr. Richard.Do you hear me?Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.Rick, I have to talk to you.I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.""Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.- We'll get on a train and never stop.""
- Don't, Rick.I can understand how you feel.You understand how I feel.How long was it we had, honey?- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.Every one of them.Mostly I remember the last one.The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain......with a comical look on his face......because his insides
have been kicked out.Can I tell you a story, Rick?Does it got a wild finish?I don't know the finish yet.Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.It's about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo.At the house of some friends......she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.A very great and courageous man.He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world......full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.And she looked up to him......and worshiped him......with a feeling she supposed was love.Yes, that's very pretty.I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano......playing in the parlor downstairs.""Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid,"" they'd always begin.I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.Tell me......who was it you left me for?Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between......or aren't you the kind that tells?I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.I would suggest you search
the cafÃ© immediately.If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.You give him credit
for too much cleverness.My impression was he's just
another blundering American.We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.It may interest you to know that
at this very moment he's on his way here.There is nothing we can do.I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?I slept very well.Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.You have reached Casablanca.It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.And mademoiselle?- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.- On one condition.
- And that is?You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague......Brussels, Amsterdam......Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts......you'll have your visa in the morning.And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp......where you had more persuasive methods
at your disposal......I certainly won't give them to you now.And what if you track down
these men and kill them?What if you murdered all of us?From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.Even Nazis can't kill that fast.Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.But in one aspect you are mistaken.You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.But there is one exception.No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate......should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.You won't dare to interfere with me here.This is still unoccupied France.Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.I believe you have a message for him?Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.Signor Ugarte is dead.I'm making out the report now.We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide......or died trying to escape.- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.Good day.Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.Excuse me, captain.Another visa problem has come up.- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.You will find him at the Blue Parrot.Thanks.Don't be too downhearted.Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.Thank you very much, signor.- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over it's a little short.Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.Here, sit down.There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.Bourbon.The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead......and no one knows where
those letters are.Practically no one.If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I'll handle the entire transaction.Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.And the carrying charges?Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.I'll tell him when he comes in.Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.You're in good company.
Renault and Strasser probably think so too.That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.Excuse me, I'll be getting back.- Morning.
- Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.Only 700 francs.- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.Doesn't matter.For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.I have some tablecloths, napkins--- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.Why did you come back? To tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?Yes.Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.I don't think I will, Rick.Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.Last night I saw
what has happened to you.The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.Not last night.Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?You can believe that if you want to.Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.Above a saloon, it's true......but walk up a flight......I'll be expecting you.All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.You'll be there.No, Rick.No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
that unfortunately I'm not able to help him.You see, my dear, word has gone around.As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am influential and respected.But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.You, however, are a different matter.Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while--Might as well be frank, monsieur.It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.We are only interested in two visas.- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.You two will want to discuss this.Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.But if the situation were different......if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one......would you take it?Yes, I would.Yes, I see.When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute......why didn't you leave me then?I meant to,
but something always held me up.I love you very much, Ilsa.Your secret will be safe with me.Ferrari is waiting for our answer.Not more than 50 francs.We've decided, Signor Ferrari.For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.Well, good luck, but be careful.- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.Because it cannot possibly profit me.Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?Yes, something.Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.But it is worth a chance.Thank you very much.
Good day.Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.- Monsieur.
- Good day.- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.It has been a pleasure to meet you.I'm sorry.Monsieur Rick,
you are getting to be your best customer.Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.That was some going-over
your men gave my place.We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.But I told my men
to be especially destructive.You know how
that impresses Germans.Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed.It looks like you're a little late.So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.Sascha!French 75s.Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.We will begin with two.What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.You see, captain?The situation is not as under control
as you believe.We try to cooperate
with your government.But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.I blow with the wind......and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.And if it should change?Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.A leader? Like Laszlo?I have been thinking.It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.I see what you mean.Thank you, Carl.Thank you, Carl.Sit down. Have a brandy with us.To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.Thank you very much.I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy......and a third glass.At last the day's came!Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.So we should feel at home
when we get to America.A very nice idea.To America.To America.What watch?- Ten watch.
- Such much?You will get along beautifully in America.How is lady luck treating you?Oh, too bad.You'll find him over there.- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here? You're underage.- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.My husband is with me too.He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.Have a drink?No, of course not. You mind if I do?Monsieur Rick...- ...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.No, I mean......is he trustworthy?
Is his word--?- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.I thought so. Where's your husband?At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.Oh, of course he's losing.- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.We come from Bulgaria.Things are very bad there.The devil has the people
by the throat.So Jan and I, we...We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.But we haven't much money......and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.It was much more than we thought
to get here.And then Captain Renault sees us...- ...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I'll bet.He tells me he can give us an exit visa.But we have no money.- Does he know that?
- Yes.- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?He always has.You are a man.If someone loved you very much......so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world......and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart......that would be all right,
wouldn't it?- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.Go back to Bulgaria.Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.In many ways
I am so much older than he is.Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.- Good evening.
- Good evening.- You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.He does. Could we
have a table close to him?And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.Right this way, if you please.I'll have Sam play ""As Time Goes By.""
I believe that's your favorite tune.Thank you.- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.Do you wish to place another bet, sir?No. No, I guess not.Have you tried 22 tonight?I said 22.Leave it there.Cash it in and don't come back.Are you sure this place is honest?Honest? As honest as the day is long.How are we doing tonight?A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.Monsieur Rick...He's just a lucky guy.Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...Captain Renault, may I--?Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.I'm very happy for both of you.Still, it's very strange that you won.Well, maybe not so strange.- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.No!Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.Go away, you crazy Russian.- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?Why do you interfere
with my little romances?Put it down as a gesture to love.Well, I'll forgive you this time.But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.And it'll make me very happy if she loses.- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead.Well, isn't there some other place?It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.- In my office.
- Right.You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.You know what I've been doing.You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people......that I reach America
and continue my work.I'm not interested in politics.The problems of the world
are not in my department.I'm a saloonkeeper.My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.You ran guns to Ethiopia.- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.But then I never was
much of a businessman.Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.My answer would still be the same.There must be some reason
why you won't let me.There is.I suggest that you ask your wife.- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.- My wife?
- Yes.Play ""La Marseillaise.""
Play it!See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a cafÃ© can inspire this demonstration......what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?I advise that this place
be shut up at once.- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.The place is to be closed.- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.Everybody is to leave immediately.This cafÃ© is closed until further notice.Clear the room at once.How can you close me up?I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.Everybody out at once.After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.That is also true, except for one destination:
occupied France.- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.Of what value is that?You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in the concentration camp here.The other alternative?My dear, perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.Good night, mademoiselle.- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.Our faithful friend is still there.Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.I must.Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?Or shall I carry on the best I can?Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?But no intention of selling them.You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.Did he give any reason?- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?Yes, he said, ""Ask your wife.""I don't know why he said that.Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.I'll be going in a few minutes.- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?When I was in the concentration camp......were you lonely in Paris?Yes, Victor, I was.I know how it is to be lonely.Is there anything you wish to tell me?No, Victor, there isn't.I love you very much, my dear.Yes, I know.Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?You don't even have to say it.I'll believe.Good night, dear.Good night.- Victor.
- Yes, dear?Be careful.Of course I'll be careful.Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.How long can I afford to stay closed?Two weeks, maybe three.Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.Thank you, Herr Rick.Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.- Then I am going to the meeting--
- Don't tell me where you're going.I won't.Good night.Good night, Mr. Rick.- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.Well, won't you sit down?- Richard, I had to see you.
- ""Richard"" again. We're back in Paris.Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.I know how you feel about me......but put your feelings aside
for something more important.I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is......what an important cause
he's fighting for?It was your cause too.In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.I'm the only cause I'm interested in.We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you--I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth--I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.You'd say anything now
to get what you want.You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.One woman has hurt you, and you
take your revenge on the rest of the world.You're a coward and a weakling.No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.What of it?I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.Now, if you'll--All right.I tried to reason with you.I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.Put them on the table.No.For the last time,
put them on the table.If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.All right,
I'll make it easier for you.Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.Richard......I tried to stay away.I thought I would never see you again.That you were out of my life.The day you left Paris......if you knew what I went through.If you knew how much I loved you.How much I still love you.And then?It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.They needed him in Prague,
but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.Just a two-line item in the paper:""Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp.""I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.Then it came.He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.Then I met you.Why weren't you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me......and for those working with us.And when did you first find out
he was alive?Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.He was sick. He needed me.I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.Well......well, you know the rest.Well, it's still a story without an ending.What about now?Now?I don't know.I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.And Laszlo?You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.All except one.He won't have you.I can't fight it anymore.I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.You have to think for both of us.For all of us.All right. I will.Here's looking at you, kid.I wish I didn't love you so much.- I think we lost them.
- Yes.- I'm afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.Thank you.Carl, what happened?The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.Yes, I come. I will do it.- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.This might come in handy.Thank you.- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?I mean, what you're fighting for.We might as well question
why we breathe.If we stop breathing, we'll die.If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?Like a man who's trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe in his heart.Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself......and that you'll never succeed.You seem to know all about my destiny.I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.I know that you're in love with a woman.It's perhaps a strange circumstance......that we both should be in love
with the same woman.The first evening I came into this cafÃ©......I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.Since no one is to blame......I demand no explanation.I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.All right.But I want my wife to be safe.I ask you as a favor......to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.You love her that much?Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.Well, I am also a human being.Yes, I love her that much.- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.On what charge?Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.It seems that destiny has taken a hand.You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.All you can do is fine him and give him
30 days. You might as well let him go now.I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.If you were to help him escape--What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.As a matter of fact,
I don't either.They're all excellent reasons.Don't count too much on my friendship.In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.Yes, I have the letters.But I intend using them myself.I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.The last man I want to see in America.You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.We have a legal right to go,
that's true......but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.Louis, I'll make a deal with you.Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big......something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
- Certainly.Germany--
Vichy would be very grateful.Then release him.You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters......and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.You get him, and we get away.To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes......but you were never interested
in any woman.- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.Oh, thanks.Go ahead, Ricky.Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.Well, so long.Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.I shall remember to pay it to myself.- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel......so I knew I'd be on time.- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.This place will never be
the same without you.I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.When we searched the place,
where were they?Sam's piano.Serves me right for not being musical.Here they are.You better wait in my office.Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?Everything is quite all right.We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.Please trust me.Yes, I will.- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.Victor Laszlo.Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.The charge of accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom the letters were stolen.You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank--Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you......but I will if you take one more step.Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.I do. We've got time to discuss that later.Call off your watchdogs, you said.Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.That is my least vulnerable spot.Hello? Is that the airport?This is Captain Renault speaking.There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.There's to be no trouble about them.Good.Hello?My car, quickly!This is Major Strasser.Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.At once, do you hear?Hello, radio tower?Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.Certainly, Rick, anything you say.- Find Laszlo's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir.This way, please.If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.You think of everything, don't you?And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.I don't understand.
What about you?I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.No. What has happened?
Last night you said--Last night we said a great many things.You said I was to do the thinking for us.I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.Now, you've got to listen to me.Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.But what about us?We'll always have Paris.We didn't have-- We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.We got it back last night.- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.But I've got a job to do too.Where I'm going, you can't follow.
What I've got to do you can't be any part of.Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people......don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.Someday you'll understand that.Now, now.Here's looking at you, kid.- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.There's something you should know.I don't ask you to explain anything.I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.You said you knew about Ilsa and me.You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?Yes.She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.But that was all over long ago.For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.I understand.- Here it is.
- Thanks.I appreciate it.Welcome back to the fight.This time I know our side will win.Are you ready, Ilsa?Yes, I'm ready.Goodbye, Rick.God bless you.You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.What you just did for Laszlo.That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.But she knew you were lying.Anyway, thanks for helping me out.I suppose you know this isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?Ask Monsieur Rick.- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.- Hello!
- Put that phone down.- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!Major Strasser has been shot.Round up the usual suspects.Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.I think perhaps you're right.It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?I could use a trip.But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.""Our"" expenses?Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

in college.Yeah, but I'm gonna keep playing.
Oh, problem solved.Godspeed then.Now, Stewart, I find the
timing of your departuredisconcerting.The corner office sits empty,the new editor
arrives on Monday,so I'm sorry, buddy,
but I gotta ask ya.What the hell
do you know?How's the cake?It's really good.
Are you saving yours?Nah, it's for Mike.
I can never eat at those things.They kind of depress me.
I know.Did you see the numbers
from Washington?Yeah. Very interesting.
I think so, too.I'm not asking if the PD's lying,
I know they're lying.All I'm asking,
who's behind it?Oh. Okay, I get it.
You don't want to talk.No, Dan, I'm not mad,
I'm hungry.I've been talking here
so long I didn't eat lunch.So I'm gonna go
get something to eat,and that'll give you
an hour to decidewhether you want to be
on the right side of thisor read about it
like everybody else.Bye, Dan.You think
Cahill has something?Maybe. I just don't think
the story's for us.Ben likes it. Yeah, it's not bad,
it's just not Spotlight.What's just not Spotlight?The PD numbers.
The numbers story. It feels thin.Oh, you got Cahill to talk?No, but I will.Good. Then we'll know
if it's thin.- How'd it go upstairs?
- Oh, okay.- Robby gave a good speech.
- Sure he did.I heard Lubin and Connor
are going to the <i>Times.</i>- Come on, really?
- Yeah, I heard that.They're leeching us.Well, at least they're sending us
a guy from Miami to run things.That should help.Has Baron even
spent time in Boston?I don't think he's ever been here before.
Maybe we should buy him a map.I have a friend down in Miami
said he cut 15% of the staff.Great...
Hey, Robby.New boss coming in
to make some cuts?I have no idea.Aren't you sitting down
with him?Yes, I am.
So is it about Spotlight?I don't know, Mike,
but I do knowthat Ben needs an answer
on the crime numbers story.I'm telling you,
I really don't think that story's for us.Mr. Baron.Walter Robinson. Robby.Thanks for taking the time
out of your weekend.Oh, my pleasure.
Appreciate it.What are you reading?Uh...<i>The Curse of the Bambino.</i>Oh, yeah,
it's a great book.The <i>Globe</i> has
season tickets at Fenwayonce you're settled in,
by the way.Thank you.Uh, to be honest,
I'm not much of a baseball fan.I'm just trying to
get a feel for the city.Oh, yeah...So you're originally
from Boston?I am. Born and raised, yeah.A lot of the newsroom
is from here.It really feels like
a local paper in that way.And did that change at all after
the paper was sold to the <i>Times?</i>No. No, I don't think
that had a big impact.Good.And you're an editor
for the Spotlight team?I'd prefer to think of myself
as player coach. But yes.Are you familiar
with Spotlight?No, not particularly.Well, we are a four-person
investigative team.We report to
Ben Bradlee, Jr.,and we keep
our work confidential.What're you
working on now?We just put out a piece on a
shoddy construction outfit,and right now we're really just
trolling around for our next story.How long does
that typically take?Hard to say.
A couple months.Couple months?Yeah, we don't like to
rush it.Once we settle on a project, we can
spend a year or more investigating it.Is that a concern?
Not necessarily.Um, but from what I understand
readership is down,Internet is cutting into
the classified business, andI think I'm gonna need to
take a hard look at things.So, do you anticipate
more cuts?I think it's safe
to assume so,but what I'm more focused on
right now is finding a wayto make this paper
essential to its readers.I like to think
it already is.Fair enough. I just think
that we can do better.Mr. Bradlee.
Hey.Saw the PD numbers.
Looks interesting.Yeah, there's something there.How long do you need?
Another week.Where're you going?
10:30.Since when?Technically,
I am an editor.Technically.Your sit-down with Baron
go that well?I couldn't get a read on him.
That's a first.How about you?
Oh, he's a barrel of laughs.Morning, everyone.
Let's get started.Do you wanna
say something, Marty?Uh, sure.Uh, hello.As most of you know by now,
my name is Marty Baron,I'm delighted to be here.Um, if you could tell me your name
as we go around, that'd be helpful.Thank you.Okay. Peter?Peter Canellos, Metro.I've got a major
Big Dig closure.Hey, Steve. Hey.
Mike.Crappy game
last night, huh?Yeah, they can't hit
worth a nickel.Hey listen, what's Eileen McNamara
doing in the 10:30?Do you need something, Mike?
No, just curious.Go be curious somewhere else.
I got work to do, huh?Okay, Steve.See you.
Yeah.And it looks like Pedro's gonna
be out until September 1st.Jimmy says he'll be back this year,
but the doc didn't seem so sure.When's the Pats' opener?Is that everyone?Yes, that's it.
Okay. Good.Thank you. Uh...Did everyone read
Eileen McNamara's column this weekend?That's the Geoghan case?Yeah, what's the folo
on that?It's a column, what kind
of folo were you thinking?Uh, well, apparently
this priest molested kidsin six different parishes
over the last 30 years,and the attorney
for the victims, Mr...Garabedian.
Thanks, Eileen.Mr. Garabedian says
Cardinal Law found outabout it 15 years ago
and did nothing.Yeah, I think that
attorney's a bit of a crank,and the church
dismissed the claim.He said, she said.Whether Mr. Garabedian
is a crank or nothe says he has documents
that prove the cardinal knew.As I understand it,
those documents are under seal.Okay, but the fact remains,
a Boston priest abused 80 kids,we have a lawyer who says he
can prove Law knew about it,and we've written all of, uh,
two stories in the last six months.This strikes me as an essential
story to a local paper.I think at the very least, we have
to go through those documents.How would you
like to do that?Oh, uh...I don't know
what the laws are here,but in Florida
we would go to court.You want to sue the church?Technically we wouldn't
sue the church.We'd file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents.The church will read that
as us suing them.So will everybody else.Good to know.Gutsy call
for the first day.That's one word for it.How do you think that's
gonna play down front?I think Gilman's
gonna shit a brick.Hey.
Door.How'd it go?Well, Baron wants to sue for the
sealed docs in the Geoghan case.Wants to sue the church?
Hey, that's great.We covered Geoghan when the
story broke three years ago.Baron was still in Miami.I think he might have been
at the <i>Times</i> then, actually.He wasn't here.So do you think
that suit has a chance?Depends on the judge.And what parish he belongs to.Bradlee. Yeah.Okay.Baron wants to talk to us.Us?Okay, Jon. Thank you.Yes. Okay, thanks.I've set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsel.Jon Albano?
Yeah.Who's the judge
in this case?Um...Constance Sweeney.Tough.
Why's that?Good Catholic girl.
Huh.So, um,judging from what I've read,
it doesn't seem like we've donea very thorough investigation
into the Geoghan case.Is that right?
No, it's not.We looked hard at Geoghan.David Armstrong from Metro,
Michael Paulson for Religion.Okay, but, uh,
just so I understand,beyond our daily coverage,
we haven't...We haven't committed any long-term
investigative resourcesto the question of whether or not
Cardinal Law knew about this?No, we haven't.And that's the kind of thing
your team would do?Spotlight? Well, yeah.But we're still prospecting the
Boston PD story I told you about.Could you set that aside?We could.Marty, in past Spotlight's
had success in large partbecause they pick
their own projects.Would you consider
picking this one?I don't know if
he's writing about you,but I will let him know
you called.Okay, bye.Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?Okay. Uh...Baron wants us to scrub
the Geoghan case.That's great.
Didn't we cover Geoghan?Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging
Cardinal Law knew about it.- Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right?
- Yeah.I covered him
at the courthouse.Can you get to him?
I only interviewed him once.He's kind of a character.I like characters.
I'll take him.Good. You take him.Also, we should be
talking to, uh,the lawyer who repped the
victims in the Porter case.Eric Macleish.
Uh-huh.That guy was always on TV.
Yeah, the Porter case?Remind me.
Yeah, um, Father Porter, similar story.Molested dozens of kids in
Fall River about 10 years ago.So, we're dropping
the Boston PD?I vote yes.
No, no.We just gotta set
it aside for now.Listen, I don't need
to tell you guys this.We need to be more
discreet than usual.All right?Everybody's gonna be interested in this,
not just the <i>Herald.</i>We can't let Cardinal Law get wind
of this until we know what we have.Good luck with that.<i>So when
do you leave, Nana?</i>The bus is picking us up in the
church parking lot at 9:00.We have 40 people going.And is Father Dominic going?No, he says
he's unlucky.But luck has nothing
to do with it.You know, last time Nana won $160.
Wow.You gonna tell her?We don't even know
if there's a story yet.Well, <i>""Globe</i> sues church""?
It's gonna be a story.Hey, Lisa. Could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me?Yeah.Is this for Spotlight?Just drop them off
when they're ready? Thanks.Excuse me, do you know where
the publisher's office is?Will do.How are you, Marty?Settling in?Yeah, I think so.
Good.What can I do for you?Um...I'd like to challenge the protective
order in the Geoghan case.You want to sue
the Catholic Church?Um...We're just
filing a motion, but...Yes.You think
it's that important?Yes, I do.Because obviously the Church
will fight us very hard on this.Which won't go unnoticed
by our subscriber base.53% of them are Catholic.Mmm-hmm.I think
they'll be interested.Okay.Marty, Lake Street
will probably contact youabout a face-to-face
with the Cardinal.It's customary.Yeah. They already have.
It's set up for next week.I wouldn't mention this.Hello?Hello?Can I help you?
Oh, hi.I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>I'm here to see
Mitchell Garabedian.He's on a call.
Please have a seat.Okay.All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.Okay.Bill! Where the hell
are those papers?I asked you to
put 'em on my desk!The famous Walter Robinson
in my conference room.Good to see you again, Eric.Sacha Pfeiffer,
Eric Macleish.Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.You don't play golf,
do you?Uh, no.
Good.Your colleague here
took some money off meat a charity event
last year.It was a very lucky putt. I actually
had my eyes closed, by the way.Mmm-hmm.So, how can I help
you guys?Uh...You're familiar
with the Geoghan case?Sure.Eighty plaintiffs.
All of them individual cases.Garabedian must be swimming.Well. And the allegations
against Cardinal Law?Yeah, it's tricky. Um...This is what you need to understand.
These are shitty cases.The statute of limitations
is only three years,and most of these victims don't
come forward until long after that.Oh. Why is that?Well, they're kids,
you know.Guilt, shame.And most of these kids come
from tough neighborhoods.Nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing.So, you're screwed
on the time limit.And, uh,even if you argue
your way around thatthe charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand.Twenty grand for
molesting a child?That is the way
the system is set up. Yes.The Church is tough.So, your best shot
is to try these casesin the press
like I did on Porter.Hmm. But, you know,
most of the victims,they don't wanna have
anything to do with TV.And, uh,Mitch isn't exactly
a people person.Yeah, and if Garabedian
can't get his victimsto go before the press,
then he's really...That's right.
He has a long road ahead of him.My guess is he doesn't
have anything on Law.What? You think
he's bluffing or...I think he's grandstanding
to cut a better deal.Seems a bit reckless.Have you met
Mitch Garabedian?I asked you to write up that motion,
Bill. I didn't ask you to file it.Hey, Bill, here's
the case files from yesterday.Hi.Who are you?
I'm Mike Rezendes from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>I had an appointment
with you about an hour ago.I can't talk to you.
I'm very busy. Sharon!No, no. She went out for coffee.
She said she'd be right back.I'm following up
on an article.The one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>
No. In the <i>Globe.</i>Did you see
the one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>No, I didn't.
I thought it was very good.I have a copy here somewhere.That's all right.
I'll track it down.I'm actually
following up on a columnthat Eileen McNamara
wrote about your suit.Suits.
There are 84 of them.It's not a class action.You should get your facts straight.
No, you're right. I should.So I'm trying to get some
background information on...You're not
recording this, are you?No, I wouldn't do
that without asking.I can't show you those Church's
documents if that's what you're after.They're under seal.Yeah, I know that.Did you know that
they tried to bring me upbefore the Massachusetts Board
of Bar Overseers three times?They're watching me
very closely.The Church?
Yeah. The Church. Yeah.They'd like to get me disbarred.
In fact, put that away.Put it away.
Sure.I don't want you recording this
in any way, shape or form.Not on paper,
not on tape, nothing.In fact, I probably shouldn't
even be speaking to you. So...Look, Mr. Garabedian,I know there's things
you cannot tell me,but I also know
there's a story here.And I think
it's an important story.I already talked
to the <i>Phoenix.</i>Yeah, and there's a reason
I didn't see it.Nobody reads
the <i>Phoenix</i> anymore.They're broke.
They don't have any power.The <i>Globe</i> does.If we cover this story,
everybody will hear about it.The Church thinks
in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.Do you think your paper has the
resources to take that on?Yeah, I do.But if you don't
mind me asking,do you?I can't talk to you right now,
Mr. Rezendes, I'm very, very busy.Sharon? Yeah.
Thank you.Can I at least talk to some
of your clients? The victims?I'd really like
to do that.Call me tomorrow, I gotta think about it.
Thank you.Thanks.
Yeah, yeah.I got more clips
from the library.Leave 'em right there.Are you guys doing
a story on the Church?No, we are not doing
a story on the Church.Matt, you find anything
on this guy, Phil Saviano?No. Who is he?He's part of
a victims' organization.Kurkjian did a story on him
right after the Porter case.There's a victims'
organization?Yeah, it's called SNAP.It's Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priests.- Crummy acronym.
- Hmm.You want me to track him down?
Yeah. Bring him in.How much longer you need
to get through the clips?I mean, a few days.
There's a lot.Lisa's still sending up more.
Okay.Hey, guys. I think I got
another priest.Liam Barrett.
Molested some kids in Phillyand was moved to Boston.Did the same thing
and was moved again.Really?
That sounds like Geoghan.Is that one of our clips?Yeah. Byline's
Diego Ribadeneira, 1997.Must've been back when
he was working Religion.Was there any folo?
Not much. One short piece.Huh.
The Church settled the case.Don't you know
Jim Sullivan?Yeah. Why?Looks like the Church
brought him in to help out.Jesus...Has anybody but Manny gotten
the ball out of the infield?Nope. Why do you even
bother with that thing?It distracts me
from the game.Know what else
is good for that?Oh, yeah. Good idea.
My round. I'll be right back.Anybody want any food?
No.I'm all set.
Hey, a hot dog.So you guys
making any progress?Absolutely. It's a good story.
Why?Because you're another lapsed
Catholic pissed off at the Church?We've got a lot of good stuff.
Like what?I'm just watching the game.
OmertÃ .They got another priest,
Liam Barrett.We reported on him.I'm just saying, we did.
Okay,but this guy was shuffled around from
parish to parish every few years,just like Geoghan
and Porter.I think there's a pattern.Sounds thin.
What else you got?Sacha's got another guy from a
victims' organization, Phil Saviano.From SNAP? Oh, boy.
We reported on him, too.I thought you were watching
the game, Steve.That guy's pretty
banged up, Mike.We did a couple
stories on him.That guy would not
stop writing letters.He wants a holy war.What? So he's not
worth talking to?Where are you
on Garabedian?I'm working on it.Robby said Macleish
thinks he's bluffing.I think there's
something there, Ben.Get me something solid,
or I'm taking you off it.I don't want us chasing
our tails on this.Stay away
from that trap.You couldn't reach that
trap in a million years, partner.I've reached that trap before.Yeah? Now Paul, maybe.- How we doing?
- We're good.We're two up in the front.Good.How's that new editor
working out?Well, he doesn't
like baseball.But he seems like
a smart guy.Yeah, I read an article
about him.Said he's the first
Jewish editor at the <i>Globe.</i>Must have been
a slow news day.He got a family,
this guy?No. He is not married.Divorced?
I don't think so, no.So the new editor of the <i>Globe</i> is an
unmarried man of the Jewish faithwho hates baseball?Yeah.
Should have given it to Ben.He's a Bradlee,
for crying out loud.Didn't raise his hand
fast enough, I guess.Hey, by the way,I've been reading about this priest,
Father Barrett.Said you were
involved with that.Barrett, yeah. Bad egg.Lake Street asked
for help, I pitched in.Victims said Cardinal Law knew about
Barrett when he came from Philly.Is that true?You know I can't talk
about the case, Robby.Off the record?Off the record
I can't talk about it.All right.
This related to the lawsuit?You know about that?Look,I don't know this guy Baron
or what his agenda is.Frankly, I don't care.I just don't want to see you
taking a bullet for him.I think you're away.Put it over here.
Let's go. Let's go.<i>So the other day
I was on the World Wide Web.</i><i>Anything you want to know.
It's right there.</i>Now, I have to admit
that as a priest,this makes me
a little nervous.Should I be worried
about job security?I don't think so.<i>You see,
knowledge is one thing,</i><i>but faith...</i><i>Faith is another.</i>Hey.Hey.Shouldn't you be
golfing or something?Golfing's not a verb.And I couldn't get
a tee time.Is that what they call it?
""Tee time""?They also call it ""a leisure activity.""
You ought to try it, Mike.I do. I run.
Yeah, you run to work.So why are you here today?Going over these clips
of Saviano.Yep, Ben and Steve
think it's a dead end.They gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game.Yeah, Ben emailed me.He did?
Yeah.He said we should
let it go.What do you wanna do?I wanna bring Saviano in.So, just ignore those guys?I think we've got to start
ignoring everybody on this one.I'm good with that.Mmm.Do you think Marty has any idea
what's coming down the pike?Nope. I don't think
he cares either.That's refreshing.Yeah.Unless he's wrong.<i>I've always been
fascinated with the newspaper business.</i>I used to sit in on the lectures
with the Nieman fellowswhen I was at Harvard.I read that you were
an editor once.Oh, yes.Yeah, that was
a very long time ago.The <i>Mississippi Register.</i>Small, diocesan newspaper.But for a 30-year-old pastor,
it was a big responsibility.Too much at times.How so?I was close with
the Evers brothers.We took a stand
on civil rights.Our readership
was not pleased.They saw me
as a meddling outsider.I can imagine.Tough seat to sit in,especially in a small town.I think you'll find that Boston's
still a small town, too, Marty,in many ways.But if I can be of any help,
Marty, don't hesitate to ask.I find that
the city flourisheswhen its great institutions
work together.Thank you.Personally I'm of the opinion that for
a paper to best perform its function,it really needs
to stand alone.Ah. Of course.But my offer still stands.Thank you.Come in.Ah!Thank you, Maureen.A little gift, Marty.Think of it as a Cardinal's
guide to the city of Boston.I'm here to see
Sacha Pfeiffer.Your name?
Phil Saviano.Okay, just a minute.So am I the first
survivor you've talked to?Yeah, Phil.
You are.Okay, well...First of all, let me say thank you
for having me in today.And I want you to knowthat you have the full cooperation
of my organization, SNAP.How many members are in
your organization, Phil?We had 11 at
our last chapter meeting...Uh, no, 10.
Karen just moved.You had a woman
in your group?Of course there was a woman.
They don't discriminate,not when it comes to abuse.And this has nothing
to do with being gay.What this is, is priests using
the collar to rape kids.Kids. Boys and girls.I was 11,and I was preyed upon by Father
David Holley in Worcester.And I don't mean prayed for.
I mean preyed upon.Are any of you Catholic?I was raised Catholic.
Now I go to my wife's Presbyterian church.I'm lapsed.I go to church with
my grandmother sometimes.It's safe to say we were all
raised Catholic, but now...Not so much.Okay. Well,
let me tell you.When you're a poor kid from a poor
family, religion counts for a lot.And when a priest pays attention
to you, it's a big deal.He asks you to collect
the hymnalsor take out the trash,
you feel special.It's like God
asking for help.So maybe it's a little weird
when he tells you a dirty joke,but now you got a secret
together, so you go along.Then he shows you a porno mag,
and you go along.And you go along,
and you go along,until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blow job.And so you go along
with that, too,because you feel trapped,because he has groomed you.How do you say
no to God, right?See,it is important to understand that
this is not just physical abuse,it's spiritual abuse, too.And when a priest does this to you,
he robs you of your faith.So you reach for
the bottle or the needle.Or if those don't work,
you jump off a bridge.That's why we call
ourselves survivors.Have you read
Jason Berry's book?He wrote about the Gauthe
case in Louisiana?Uh, that's ""G""...
G-A-U-T-H-E.Here. And talk to
Richard Sipe.He worked in one of the
Church's treatment centers.He's an ex-priest,married a nun.Here.This is his testimony
from the Kos case.Uh, Phil,
what's a treatment center?It's where they send priests
when they get caught.This is all right here
in the box,I sent this all to you guys
five years ago.Uh, to the <i>Globe?</i>
Who did you send it to?I don't wanna say who, but they
said that they weren't interested.Uh, but Phil, we did run a
couple of stories on you.I saw them in the clips.Yeah, but to be completely frank,
it wasn't enough.You guys gotta understand,this is big.This is not just Boston. It's the
whole country. It's the whole world.And it goes right
up to the Vatican.Do you have any
proof of that, Phil?No, not yet. But think about it,
there are so many of them.How else could they have
hidden it for so long?So many what?
Priests!Priests!I know of 13
right here in Boston.You know 13 priests in Boston
who have molested children?Yeah, why do you keep
repeating everything I say?I just like to
clarify things.Maybe you should have
clarified it five years agowhen I sent you
all of this stuff!It's all right here!May I use your bathroom?Yeah, sure, Phil.Come on.Well, what do you think?Well, the guy, he's got an agenda,
that's for sure.You think?
He's obviously been through a lot.But he's smart, and if he's
right about 13 priests...Yeah, it might be
a big ""if"" with this guy.Do a background check
on him,and follow up with some of the
other survivors of his group.I'll track down
this ex-priest, Sipe.Okay, but stay on Garabedian.
That's more important.Garabedian,
what a pain in the ass.You can be a pain
in the ass, Mike.Mmm.Mitchell, what a surprise.
How are you?I'm fine, Mr. Rezendes.
Good.You know, I haven't heard back from you.
I left you a couple of messages.I know. I've been very busy.
I don't have time for calls.Oh, jeez,
I'm sure you don't.Listen, listen, Mitch, let me
talk to a couple of the victims.You could sit in
on the interview,and if you're not happy,
you could kill it.I spoke to my clients, and they don't
want to be in the press. I'm sorry.I get that, but I don't need
to name names.I don't believe you, Mr. Rezendes.
I'm sure you don't.I don't.
Listen, Mitchell.Look, Mr. Rezendes,
please...I'm not writing
a profile here.I'm working on something bigger.
Bigger?I don't know
what that means.I'm not supposed
to tell you this,but I'm digging around
for Spotlight.Spotlight's on this?
Yeah, we're looking into it,but you gotta help me.You gotta let me talk to some
of these victims, please.Please.Come back tomorrow.
9:30 a.m.Thank you.Ms. Pfeiffer?
Joe?Hi.
Oh, shoot.Oh, that's okay.
Sorry.No, no problem.
Please sit.Thank you.Is this table okay?This is perfect.I had a muffin
while I was waiting.Two, actually.I eat when I'm nervous.
I do that, too, actually.I hope I'm not late.
Phil told me 1:00.No, you're fine.
I got here early.About an hour.Um, would you mind if I took some notes?
Would that be all right?You don't mind
if I take some notes, do you?- Are you going to use my name?
- No.Not if you don't
want me to. No.I just had a kid.He's only one, but I'm not sure
I want him to know about this.Sure. I get that.You can stop this interview
at any time, Patrick.All right?
Okay.Go ahead with your notes.Okay. So, um...Where'd you live
when it first happened?In the projects,
over in Hyde Park.Over by the Stop & Shop?Yeah, you know it?Yeah, I drove a cab
for a few years.Open early.
Bad coffee, right?Yeah, I guess.How old were you
when it happened?I was 12.Just after my dad
killed himself.Ah, jeez.He was a real
piece of shit.And my mom,
she wasn't so stable either.How do you mean?
I mean, she was nuts.She was a schizophrenic.
Same shit.When did you
first meet Geoghan?Well, my sister,she saw him over
in the Dunkin' Donuts.Tells him about my old man passing,
and he rushed right over.And there was this nun,
Sister Barbara,and she ran this group for
kids from troubled families.Mmm-hmm.Where was that?St. Ambrose in Dorchester.
Okay.She's the one who introduced
me to Father Shanley.He was a street priest.Long hair. Very hip.He invited me to his
apartment in Back Bay.Where in Back Bay?
Beacon Street.Beacon. Okay.Are you from here?Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio,
but my mom's from Southie.Okay, so you get it.
I'd never even seen Back Bay.So what happened
on that first visit, Joe?Well, he was very nice
at first,very funny, very casual.And I think he could tell
I was gay,so he showed me this mobile he had,
like, over a baby's crib?Mmm-hmm.But with different words.""Homosexual,
transsexual, bisexual.""Okay, and did you know you
were gay at that time, Joe?Yeah.But that wasn't information
I was sharing with anybody.Not in Dorchester.Okay.So, what happened after
he showed you the mobile?Well, I was
a little freaked out.Mmm-hmm.I think he could tell,so he said, ""You know what'll
help is if we play strip poker.""Course I lost.And, uh, things went on
from there.Can you tell me
specifically what happened?Specifically, he...He molested me.Joe, I think that the language is
going to be so important here.We can't sanitize this.
Just saying ""molest"" isn't enough.People need to know
what actually happened.We should probably get these to go.
Right.Geoghan shows up,
and my mom, you know, she's...She's thrilled.
I mean...This was like God
showing up, you know?Sure. Right.So what happened then?You really want to
hear this shit?Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do.He offers to take me
to get ice cream.And, you know, he's a priest.
I'm a kid, so I go.Sure.
So we're driving home and he...He starts patting my leg,you know, thenhis hand just slides right up,
and he grabs my dick.You know, I just froze up.
I was fucking petrified, I couldn't move.I didn't know what to do.
I was just a little kid.Yeah.You know, I never even
touched my ice cream.It just melted down my arm.Did you, um...Did you see him again
after that?Yeah.All right. That's good.
Let's stop there for now.Sure.He said it was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body.Mmm.So what happened
after that?Well, he took off his
clothes, and he said,""I've been so depressed,""but maybe you can cheer me
up and give me a blow job.""Classy guy.And did you?
Yeah.I know what you must be thinking,
like, why would I ever do thatto some creepy guy who's 30
years older than me, but...What you have to understand is that
this is the first time in my lifethat someone told me that it
was okay to be gay. Mmm-hmm.And it was a priest.
Right.So you had oral sex.
Did you have intercourse?Yes.Not then, but later.It really
messed me up.I'm sober now, but that...
That was the beginning of it all.It's very confusing,
you know,to be introduced to sex
like that and then...And then to be
attracted to men, it's...I'm sorry.
I knew I was gonna do this.Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.It's okay, Joe.
It's okay.Of course there is a
church right there.And a playground.Joe, did you ever
try and tell anyone?Like who? A priest?Can I use your phone?Yeah, sure.
You know where it is.You can use my name
if you want.Thanks, Patrick.Don't thank me,
just get these assholes, will you?He's one of the lucky ones.He's still alive.Do you want
a cup of tea, Sacha?I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.
Okay.<i>Hello.</i>
Hi, Joe, it's Sacha Pfeiffer.<i>Hi, Sacha. How are you?</i>
I'm good, thanks.Listen, Joe, I just wanted
to follow up on one thing.You talked to Phil Saviano
about all of this, right?<i>Yeah, I did.
I went to a couple of SNAP meetings.</i>And did Phil ever suggest
you do anything about it?<i>No.</i><i>The meetings
weren't really about that.</i><i>I mean, a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer,</i><i>but I didn't think
it was worth it.</i>Why not?<i>There were just so
many forms to fill out.</i><i>It was overwhelming,
you know.</i><i>And he said it could only get
me a small settlement, so...</i>Who, who said that?
<i>The lawyer told me that.</i>So you did go
and see a lawyer?<i>Yeah, but I didn't
end up using him,</i><i>so I didn't think
it was important.</i><i>I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to hide anything.</i>No, I know, Joe.Do remember his name?
The lawyer?<i>No, but maybe Phil
would know.</i><i>The guy was on TV a lot
during the Porter case.</i><i>He was handsome.</i>Was it Eric Macleish?<i>Yeah, that's it. Macleish.</i><i>I thought
he was very handsome.</i>Hey.
Hey.I was just in the newsroom.
Judge Sweeney set a date for the hearing.Really? When?Two weeks, in Springfield.Canellos started a pool.
Ten bucks to get in.Anyone picking the <i>Globe?</i>He's only taking bets on how
fast Sweeney rules against us.- Robby.
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i><i>Did you get my message?</i>
I did.Looks like Father Shanley
could be our fourth priest.<i>Yeah, I think he is.</i>Did you follow up
with Macleish?<i>I just talked to Phil.</i><i>He said Macleish dealt with
a number of these cases.</i><i>Guess he forgot to mention that.</i>
Yeah.I'm gonna go to
the courthouse tomorrow,see if I can find any cases he
settled against the Church.<i>All right. Call me
after you do. Good night.</i>Okay, good night.Hey.You wanted to chat?Yeah, I'm late for a dinner.
You wanna walk me out?Sure.Jeez.Does this guy ever go home?
Apparently not.I got guys who won't leave
till he does.He's wearing out the goddamn newsroom.Where are we on Geoghan?Following up
on more victims.Hey, I want to expand
the investigation.Why?
We got a fourth priest.There might be
as many as 13.Thirteen?
Yeah.Who's your source?
Phil Saviano.Oh, Jesus Christ, Robby, I told Mike...
I know, I know...I think Saviano
might be legit, Ben.You wanna elaborate
on that?No. Not really.It just feels like this thing's
stacking up. It's my gut.Okay.
Okay. Good.Thank you.Hello?<i>Mr. Rezendes?</i>
Uh, yeah. Who's this?<i>It's Richard Sipe.</i>Oh, yeah. Hey, Richard, how are you?
<i>I'm good.</i>Uh, thanks
for calling. Look...Phil Saviano
gave me your name.I was wondering if I can
ask you a few questions.<i>Of course. Yeah.</i>
Great.So, Phil told me
that you were workingat one of the Church's treatment
centers in Baltimore?<i>Yes. The Seton
Psychiatric Institute.</i><i>It was run by
the Daughters of Charity.</i>And, uh,
when was that, Richard?<i>Well, I started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965,</i><i>and I was there
for five years,</i><i>but I spent the next 30 studying
abusive priests and their victims.</i>Really?
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>And that's been
your sole focus?<i>Look, Mike,</i><i>the Church wants us to believe
that it's just a few bad apples.</i><i>But it's a much
bigger problem than that.</i>How much bigger, Richard?<i>Well, based on the research,</i><i>I would classify it as a
recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.</i>That's big.Hey, Mac.
Hey.If I wanted historical
data on a priest,parishes he'd been
assigned to,where would I find that?The Geoghan case? It's all in the clips.
Lisa has the source material.Yeah, what if it was
for another priest?One that hadn't been
in the papers.You're looking at another priest?
Who're you looking at?Any ideas?Oh, come on, Matt,
you're not going to tell me?I gotta get to a meeting.
Thanks, Mac.Hey, Steve.The archdiocese puts
out an annual directory.Every priest and parish.
That's great.Do these go back
any further than '98?Oh, yeah. Going back to
the '80s in the mez.Beyond that you gotta
go to the BPL.In the mez, huh? Thanks, Lisa.
You bet.He said they all target
the same kind of kid.Low-income families,
absentee fathers, broken homes.So a guy like Geoghan goes after
boys not because he prefers them,but because they have
more shame.Less likely to talk.These guys
are predators, Robby.And I talked to Sipe.
He said he'd seen dozens of themin the '60s in Seton.He called it
a ""phenomenon.""Why didn't he go public?
He did,but the Church made a huge
effort to discredit him.Smear campaigns,
public statements by prominent bishops.It's just like Saviano said,
and Garabedian.You getting anywhere
with him?More victims.
More victims.You can't empty his pockets?
I'll get to him.I just need more time.
Oh, come on, Mike.You gotta get him.
I'll get him, I'll get him.Jesus. What the hell
is that smell?There's a dead rat
in the corner.What have you got?
Church directories.It's every priest
in Massachusetts.What parish
they're assigned to.Are these official?
Yeah.I figured it could
help us track downsome of the priests
that Saviano mentioned.Maybe find
some more victims.Can we turn on some more lights?
I couldn't find the switch.You wanna borrow my glasses?
No, I'm good. I'm good.Look, 1983. John Geoghan,
St. Brendan Parish, Dorchester.So we can find out where any
priest is in any given year?Yeah, I got him here at...Huh.What?1980, the year Geoghan was pulled from JP.
It says he's on sick leave.Come on.
It really says that?Where is, uh, 1991?Here ya go.
Let me see this.Barrett. Barrett. Liam.I can't read that.
Look for a Liam Barrett in there.1991's the year they pulled
him out of Charlestown.Barrett, Liam.Yeah.
""Sick leave.""It's an official designation.Let's get these upstairs.And, Matt, check on those
priests Saviano gave us.- Robby. Yeah.
<i>- Hey, I'm down at the courthouse.</i>Something's not right here.
Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.Okay, thanks.Yeah, we need to go talk
to Macleish again.<i>Really, why?</i>
Huh? There's nothing here.There aren't any records,
I checked every name.Thanks for waiting. So sorry, guys.
Stuck on a call.Not a problem.
How are you? Good.Thanks for meeting us.
You bet. What's up, guys?Mr. Macleish, are you familiar
with a priest named Paul Shanley?Yes, I am familiar
with him.And have you settled cases
against Father Shanley?As I'm sure you can understand,
I can't discuss that with you.How about, uh,
Father Ronald Paquin?Well, I can't discuss that with you either.
Come on, guys.We understand you've settled several
cases against each of them.Even if I'd been involved
in those cases,the settlements
would be confidential,and I could be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence.Okay?
Mmm-hmm.Look, I told you guys,
these are tough cases.Most of these folks, they
just want some acknowledgmentof what happened.We got 'em a sit-down with the
bishop and a little dough,and that's the best
they could hope for.Well, it's certainly the best
the priests could hope for.No, the Church promised they'd take
the priests out of circulation.And did you follow up
on that?Do you guys
need anything else?Yes. Why aren't there
any records?I was down at
the courthouse earlier.There aren't any records
of any of these settlements.We dealt directly
with the Church.We would draw up a demand letter
and send it to the chancery.You never filed
anything in court?It's a private mediation.So, this is just you
and the archdiocese's lawyersin a room?Correct.Anyone else?Occasionally, the Church would bring in
another defense attorney to help out.You have names?Nope.No, I don't.So this was all
under the table?There's no paper trail.
At all.The victim has to sign
a confidentiality agreementto get the settlement.The lawyer takes a third and the
Church sweeps it under the rug.Jeez,
it's a freakin' racket.It's more complicated
than that.Macleish's got a duty to the client
to get the best deal he can.Sure, but how many victims do
you represent and profit frombefore you say something?Garabedian would say none.That's why he's taking
these cases to courtbecause he wants people
to know about this.I agree.
And legal ethics aside, Ben,I mean, operating
the way Macleish hasall but guarantees that the
abuse stays under wraps.Yeah. Did Macleish confirm
all Saviano's priests?No. He's limited by his
confidentiality agreement.But clearly he's settled cases
against a number of them.Phil's put me in touch with
some of the other victims,I'm pretty confident all of his
priests are gonna check out.So it is 13 priests?Yeah.
Looks that way.Holy shit.Okay. Keep going.I'm sorry.
What was the name again?Uh, Baron.B-A-R-O-N.I'm having trouble finding it.
Just give me a second.It's okay, Kim,
I can vouch for him.I'm Pete Conley, I'm on the
board of Catholic Charities.Welcome to Boston,
Mr. Baron.Thank you.
I appreciate you joining us.We're very proud of the
work we do here at Boston.Oh, the Cardinal said
you had a nice visit.Yes, we did.He's an extraordinary man.
I'm glad you had a chance to chat.Enjoying yourself?Uh, to be honest, these events
aren't really my strong suit.Yeah. Are you involved
with the charity?Not directly, no.
Several of my friends are.We all went to high school.
BC High.That's the school across
the street from the <i>Globe.</i>It's hard to miss.
Yeah.Hard to get away from,
too, apparently.The Cardinal's in the corner
if you're so inclined.We've met.
Really?Did he mention the suit?No, but he did give me a
copy of the catechism.Yeah, well, the Cardinal's
not known for his subtlety.During the Porter investigation,he'd literally called down the
power of God on the <i>Globe.</i>How'd that play out?A week later our editor
broke his leg skiing.Shrimp toast,
gentlemen?No, thanks.
No.You said one of the victims
filed a criminal complaint?Yeah, there were
a few of them.But the judge had
the case records sealedafter friends of
the Church complained.And the Church has
a lot of friends.Like Eric Macleish?Yeah.Let's just say he's not
part of the solution.You follow what I'm saying?
Sure.You work hard,
Mr. Rezendes.Are you married?
Yeah.Your wife doesn't mind you
working all the time?Oh, yeah, she does.That's why I never got married.
I'm too busy.What I do
is too important.Hmm.Your new editor,
he's a Jew right?Oh, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, see,he comes in and suddenly everybody's
interested in the Church.You know why?Because it takes
an outsider, like me.I'm Armenian.How many Armenians
do you know in Boston?Steve Kurkjian,
works at the <i>Globe.</i>Oh, that's two.
You should get a prize or something.What are you, Italian?
No, I'm Portuguese.From where?
East Boston.Really? East Boston?You don't sound like it.This city, these people,making the rest of us
feel like we don't belong.But they're no better
than us.Look at how they treat
their children.Mark my words,
Mr. Rezendes,if it takes a village
to raise a child,it takes a village
to abuse one.Hey, here he is. Want a beer?
Love one.Another.
You here with Barbara?No, she hates these things.
Karen, too.Yeah.
Smart ladies.<i>SlÃ¡inte.</i>Mmm.I met your new editor.Seemed like a decent fellow.
I think he is.Hey, I had an interesting conversation
with Eric Macleish the other day.Turns out he's been settling abuse
cases with the archdiocese for years.You really wanna
talk about this here?Jim, you said you helped out
on Father Barrett as a favor.That was a one-off?How many of these cases
have you been involved with?You know I can't answer that, Robby.
It's unethical.Is that all it is?So, this would be
the Robby RobinsonI've always heard about
but never met.Listen to me, Jimmy.You wanna be on
the right side of this.This is the Church
you're talking about, Robby.Look around.
These are good people,done a lot of good
for this city.Enjoy the party.I've been through
a lot of these now.""Sick leave"" isn't the
only designation they usewhen they take one of these
priests out of circulation.They use a slew of terms.
""Absent on leave,""""unassigned,""
""emergency response.""They got a word for everything, these guys.
Hmm. Except ""rape.""And they move parishes way more
frequently than other priests.When I was a kid,
a priest movedafter seven or eight years,
sometimes longer.These guys, it's two
to three years tops.And did they use these designations
for all of Saviano's priests?Yeah, it's a pretty
clear pattern.Guys, I got Sipe.<i>I think if you really
want to understand the crisis,</i><i>you need to start with
the celibacy requirement.</i><i>That was my first
major finding.</i><i>Only 50% of the clergy
are celibate.</i><i>Now, most of them are having
sex with other adults.</i><i>But the fact remains that this
creates a culture of secrecy</i><i>that tolerates and
even protects pedophiles.</i>So you believe the Church is aware
of the extent of this crisis?<i>Oh, absolutely. After the first
major scandal in Louisiana,</i><i>Tom Doyle, the secretary-canonist
for the papal nuncio,</i><i>co-authored a report
warning pedophile priests</i><i>were a
billion-dollar liability.</i><i>That was in 1985.</i>1985?
<i>That's right.</i>Who saw that report?
Anyone from the Catholic hierarchy?<i>Sure.</i><i>Doyle tried to introduce
the report at</i><i>the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.</i><i>In fact, Cardinal Law initially
helped to fund the report.</i><i>But then he backed out,
and they shelved it.</i>Are you kidding me?Richard, Robby here.We think we have 13 priests in
Boston that fit this pattern,which would be
a very, very big story.Does that sound right to you
in terms of scale?<i>No, not really, Robby.
It sounds low to me.</i><i>My estimates suggest 6% act
out sexually with minors.</i>Uh, 6% of what?<i>6% of all priests.</i>How many priests
do we have in Boston?About 1,500.
1% is 15.6% is90.All right, 90 priests.
Is that possible?<i>From a metric standpoint,</i><i>yes, that would certainly be
in line with my findings.</i><i>Hello?</i>Uh...Ninety fucking priests?
In Boston?That's what he said.If there were 90 of these bastards,
people would know.Maybe they do.And no one said a thing?Good Germans?I don't think that's a comparison
you want to make publically.Macleish knew.
He just didn't say anything.That's 13 priests.There's a big difference
between 13 and 90.Where's this guy Sipe
getting his numbers?Well, he's been studying
it for 30 years.He is a trained
psychotherapist.Okay, but we need something
more than a metricfrom some hippy ex-priest
who's shacking up with a nun.Okay, so we'll track down more victims.
We'll get more priests.Then we can check them
against the directories.That's a shitload
of victims.We'll get there.How long's it gonna take?Too long.Wait, but...
Meeting's over?Yeah, for now.Look, what've you got?
What if we work backwards?What do you mean? From what?
From the directories.We've been using them
to confirm bad priests.What if we do it
the other way around?Use the directories to identify
bad priests. Yeah, exactly.We search by designation.We look for any priest on
""sick leave"" or ""unassigned.""Or have been moved around a lot.
Yeah.It's gonna take
a load of work.Well, not if we're
all on it.You, too?Generally that's what ""all"" means. Yeah.
Yeah, generally.Library is closing.Library is closing.Holy shit.No freakin' way.- Talbot.
- Yeah.- Tivnan.
- Yeah.Toma.
Yeah.Turnbull.
Yeah.Walsh.
Yeah.Welsh.
Yeah.That's it.
That's it.Holy shit.
Robby?That's three off Sipe's estimate.
That's incredible.Robby?How many?
Eighty-seven.Eighty-seven priests
in Boston.Call Macleish. I wanna talk to him.
Okay.Can you print it?
Sure can.<i>Jim Sullivan's office.</i>Yeah, Walter Robinson
for Jim Sullivan.Tell him it's important,
please.<i>One moment, please.</i><i>Hey, Robby.
Everything okay?</i>I need you
to tell me something, Jim.Could it be 90 priests?<i>What?</i>
Could it be as high as 90?<i>Jesus, Robby.</i>I need to know, Jim. I wouldn't
be asking if it wasn't important.<i>You gotta stop this, Robby.</i>Robby, Macleish's assistant said
he's all booked up, he can't see us.Yeah. Well, the hell
he can't.All right.
That'll be fun.You know what,
I'll catch up with you, okay?We're good.Hey, guys,
I'm really sorry, I am,but I don't have any time
to talk right now,but if you call
my assistant...Mr. Macleish,
we have reason to believethat there are allegations against
as many as 87 priests in Boston.I can't talk to you
about that.Does that number sound right to you?
You gotta be kidding me.I just told you I don't have
time for this crap right now.Eric. How many priests
did you settle?Robby, you know
I can't tell you that.You're gonna give me the names
and the names of their victims.Are you threatening me?We've got two stories here.We've got a story
about degenerate clergy,and we've got a story
about a bunch of lawyersturning child abuse
into a cottage industry.Now, which story
do you want us to write?'Cause we're writing
one of them.I already sent you
a list of names.What're you talking about?
To whom?The <i>Globe</i>. Years ago.After the Porter case.
I got plenty of calls.I had 20 priests
in Boston alone,but I couldn't go after them
without the press.So I sent you guys a list of names,
and you buried it.I want those names tomorrow.Check your
goddamn clips, Robby.We didn't find
anything in the clips.Yeah. Big surprise.Richard, do you still
go to mass?<i>No. No, I haven't been
to church for some time now.</i><i>But I still
consider myself a Catholic.</i>How does that work?<i>Well, the church
is an institution, Mike.</i><i>Made of men.</i><i>It's passing.
My faith is in the eternal.</i><i>I try to separate the two.</i>Sounds tricky.
<i>It is.</i><i>Especially since the Church
continues to go after me.</i><i>It takes a toll, Mike.</i><i>They'll try to silence
anyone who speaks out.</i><i>I'm sure they'll come after you
and your team soon enough.</i>Really? And how do you think
they'll do that?Hello?Richard?Who is it?It's the archbishop
of Canterbury.I had dinner at Santarpio's,
had some leftovers.Ah, you're the freakin' best.
Thanks. You want a beer?Yeah.
You got it.Jesus.How much longer you gonna be
in this shithole?Yeah. I'm working on it.She's a good girl, Mike.Yeah, she is.
We'll figure it out.I haven't had
a lot of time lately.I just got off the phone
with Sipe, actually.Have you met this guy
in person yet?No, but his knowledge of this
is on a whole other level.I'm freaking starving.So, where are we
with the 90?We're close.
How close?We're close.
Just answer the question, will you?We got 87 names.We're trying to get confirmation.
I think we will.Something bugging you?It's just surprising,
that's all.Yeah. Yeah, it is.
For everybody.Oh, hey, Ben.
I forgot to ask you.Phil Saviano said he sent a bunch of
info over to the <i>Globe</i> years ago.Do you have any idea to who?No, why?Well, I'm just curious.
I wanted to seeif there's any leads
you guys didn't run out.Saviano was a fucking train
wreck five years ago, Mike.We didn't miss anything.This story needed Spotlight.Yeah, I agree.
I'm just following up.Good night.
Yeah, good night.This is unbelievable.When did you get this?Macleish emailed
the list this morning.He settled cases
against 45 priests.Where are we on Law?Anything that shows he
had knowledge of this?We're still working Garabedian.
But nothing concrete.I keep thinking about that
conversation we had the other nightabout how Law called
down the power of Godwhen we reported on Porter.That's just Law
being Law.Okay, but I checked the clips,and, uh, Porter isn't even
in the Boston archdiocese.- He's from Fall River.
- Sowhy the extreme reaction?Law had to know.That's why he
had the reaction.Because he knew
there were others.I think that's
the bigger story.Bigger than 50 priests?If it came from
the top down, yes.But the numbers
clearly indicatethat there were senior
clergy involved.That's all they do.
Indicate.Are you telling me
that if we run a storywith 50 pedophile
priests in Boston...Mike!We'll get into the same cat
fight you got into on Porter,which made a lot of noise,but changed things
not one bit.We need to focus on the institution,
not the individual priests.Practice and policy.Show me the Church
manipulated the systemso that these guys wouldn't
have to face charges.Show me they put
those same priestsback into parishes,
time and time again.Show me this was systemic,that it came
from the top down.Sounds like we're
going after Law.We're going
after the system.Make a list of all the victims we have.
Start reaching out.And bring Matt in if you need help.
Mmm-hmm.Okay. Hey, when you
go to Springfield?- Our hearing is Monday.
- Okay.Hey, Robby,
you got a second?Yeah.I, uh, got one of those
treatment centersa block from
my house.We got neighbors
with kids.I know that the work we do is
confidential, but I'm feeling like...I should tell 'em.We'll tell 'em soon.You sure?Yeah.
Okay.Hi there. I'm Sacha Pfeiffer.
I'm with <i>The Boston Globe.</i>I was just looking for a gentleman
by the name of Matthew Walsh.Uh...
No, he's not.Yeah, okay. Okay.Hi.
Hi.I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>Yeah, what do you want?I'd like to speak
with Thomas Kennedy.He doesn't live
here anymore.Do you know
where he lives?Sir, I'd just like
to ask a few...Uh, Sacha Pfeiffer,
<i>Boston Globe.</i>Oh, yeah, hi.Hi. Thank you.Anything else
you can recall?No.No, but I got
a cousin in Quincy.She saw him in the street
a few years later.<i>The Bishop came
over to the house.</i>He said nothing like this
had ever happened before,and he asked us
not to press charges.And what did
your mother do?My mother?She put out
freakin' cookies.<i>There was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet.</i>From the Church?Yeah, from
the Church.But not just
the Church.From my friends,from the other
parishioners.<i>Well, many of
the priests that I treated</i><i>were psychosexually stunted,</i><i>on the emotional level
of a 12- or 13-year-old.</i>Jeez.Sure the Chief knew.
Everybody knew,but nobody wants
to cuff a priest.Mmm.And what about
the prosecutor?I shouldn't talk
about this shit.I think you should,
actually.Do you know a Father Hurley
or a Father Gale?I do.I swear to God,
I'll beat the shit out of you.Sorry to bother you.You leave me alone,
you leave my brother alone!You hear me,
God damn it?Hi there.
I'm looking for Ronald Paquin.Yes?You're Father Paquin?Yes, that's right.I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>Okay.Could I ask you
a few questions?Go ahead, dear.We spoke to several men who
you knew when they were boysat St. John the Baptist
in Haverhill.They told us you molested them.
Is that true?Sure I fooled around,
but I never felt gratified myself.Right. Um, but you
admit to molesting boysat St. John the Baptist?Yes, yes,
but as I said,I never got
any pleasure from it.That's important
to understand.Right.Um, but can you
tell me where and howyou fooled around
with these boys?I want to be clear,I never raped anyone.There's a difference.
I should know.How would you know?I was raped.I'm sorry,
who raped you?Ronnie, who're
you talking to?It's okay, Jane.
Father Paquin, who raped you?Who are you?Uh... Sacha Pfeiffer,
from the <i>Globe.</i>Please get off my porch.
I can speak for myself.Get inside the house, Ronnie.
Mr...Get inside, Ronald.
Sorry.Uh, I'm sorry, who are you?I'm his sister,and I don't want
you coming back here.Ms. Paquin...Beat you to
the end of the street!No, you won't.
I beat you last time!No, you didn't,
you cheated!You did!Could you please clarify the <i>Globe's</i>
position for me, Mr. Albano?Yes, Judge Sweeney.Our argument to make
these documents publicrests mainly on
First Amendment grounds.We also have a number
of other relevant arguments.After all, Your Honor,this was a
discretionary order.Yes, it was made
at the Judge's discretion.Hey, Mike.Hey, Joe.What's a
Spotlight reporterdoing in Springfield?Your boy Albano's
sledding uphill.You actually think you have a
shot at winning this thing?You want me to comment
for the <i>Herald?</i><i>""Globe</i> reporter
would not comment,""but he did not
seem hopeful.""He didn't try
and hide it at all.He had this really odd
rationalization for it.Like it was
totally normalto fool around
with little boys.I'd really like to go back.
I think he'd talk to us.Oh, we will.Just not yet.I want you to stay focused
on the victims right now.Sacha, where'd they send
Father Talbot again?Um, I think...
Wasn't that Cheverus?Cheverus, that's right.Wait, Father Talbot
from BC High?Yeah, you know him?Yeah, he was there
when I was.We have a victim?Yeah, lives
in Providence.There's nothing personal in
these documents, Your Honor.They concern how the
Cardinal is handling...Say ""the archdiocese.""Excuse me?You don't get to
tag the Cardinalwith everything,
Mr. Albano.Say ""the archdiocese.""Judge Sweeney, the <i>Globe</i>
is not a party to this case,they just want
to sell papers.If Mr. Garabedian
had not smearedthe Cardinal's
good name,we wouldn't even be here.Your Honor, I object to the
use of the word ""smear.""Duly noted,
Mr. Garabedian.Thank you, Your Honor.Anything else,
Mr. Rogers?No, Your Honor.Mr. Albano,
you may continue.<i>The Globe</i>
believes having...Hey, Mitch,
how are you doing?I'm fine.He's tough,
that Wilson Rogers.He's smug.And he's sloppy.He doesn't seem sloppy.You don't know the half of it.
Trust me.What's the
half of it?Tell me the
half of it, Mitch.Off the record?
Off the record, yeah.Three years ago,
I get a call from an ex-priest.Anthony Benzevich.He was at Blessed
Sacrament back in '62,and he saw Geoghantaking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom, okay?So he's appalled,
all right?Tells the bishop
about it.The bishop threatens
to reassign himto South America.Jesus.
Yeah, all right.So fast forward 35 years,Benzevich reads that
Geoghan's been chargedwith molesting
hundreds of kids.All right? So he feels guilty.
He calls me.So you have
testimony of a priesttelling his superiors
about Geoghan in '62?No, I do not.Because when I called Benzevich
in to give a deposition,he comes in
with a lawyer.Wilson Rogers.
Right.And suddenly
Father Benzevichhas a very foggy memory.Can't remember anything.
He's useless.So I go back to work,I forget about it.
Whatever.Until about a year ago,
I find an articleabout a priest who warned
church officials about Geoghan.Benzevich went to the press?
Yeah.Yeah, local paper, <i>Patriot Ledger.</i>
Nobody saw it.But now I got
Benzevich on record.So I file a motion to depose
Benzevich a second time.All right?
And Wilson Rogers,that smug son of a bitch,he files a motion
opposing my motion.And that's when
I have him.Have him how?Rogers opposes my motion,so I have to
make an argumentas to why I'm
allowed to deposeFather Benzevich
a second time, okay?But this time,
I'm allowed to attach exhibits.Do you follow
what I'm saying?The sealed documents?
Yes.I can attach
the sealed documentsthat I've gotten in discovery,
Mr. Rezendes,the same documents that your
paper is currently suing for.You're shitting me?What?
No. No, I'm not shitting you.So I pull out the 14
most damning docsand I attach 'em
to my motion.And they prove
everything. Everything.About the Church,
about the bishops, about Law.And it's all public?Because your motion
to oppose Roger's motionis public.
Yeah, exactly.Now you're
paying attention.So I could just walk into
that courthouse right nowand get those documents?No, you cannot,because the documents
are not there.But you just
said they're public.I know I did,
but this is Boston,and the Church does not
want them to be found.So they are not there.Mitch, are you telling me
that the Catholic Churchremoved legal documents
from that courthouse?Look, I'm not crazy,
I'm not paranoid.I'm experienced.Check the docket.
You'll see.They control everything.Everything.I gotta go back in.These guys got
the fucking documents.Docket entry number 49,
it's in the Geoghan case.We're closing
in 10 minutes.Ten minutes?
All right.- Robby.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>Hey.
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>Garabedian gave me a tip.
Some of the sealed docs are already public.They're part of
a motion he filed.<i>He said they're
the best of the bunch.</i><i>We don't have to wait
for Sweeney's ruling.</i>So we can get them?<i>Yeah, but they're not there.</i>Already talked to Albano.He said all we have
to do is file a motion,and Sweeney will order Mitch
to refile the docs.And you think
these documents are...<i>He said these 14 docs were all we need.
They're huge.</i>Okay. I'll call Ben.
Good work....<i>whether</i>
<i>this was truly an accident</i><i>or someone committed
an intentional act.</i><i>But either way,
extensive damage</i><i>has been done
to this building.</i>What happened?They're saying
it's a prop plane,but that's not
a prop plane.Tell Linda to get every
reporter we have in here now.<i>You pray for the victims,</i><i>you pray for the injured,</i><i>and you pray for
those who survived.</i><i>You pray, too, for the nation.</i><i>That our response to this might reflect
the best ideals of our nation.</i><i>And even more,
reflect God's own teaching.</i><i>Not only as it's shown
in Christianity and Judaism,</i><i>but in Islam as well.</i>Not bad. Who's there?
Paulson.I wanna talk to him
when he's back.Did Rezendes find a way
to get to Florida yet?They just opened the
airport in Providence.He's on his way
there now.Ben, I'm gonna need more
people on Massport.I'll give you
three of my guys.- Robby, put your team on that, too.
- Got it.And Robby,
everything else stops.Understood.Why's Mike going
to Florida?Flight school. It's
where they learned to fly.Robby, I've got a lot of victim
interviews set up this week.We have to cancel 'em.That's gonna be hard.
I know.This is nuts.
Two days ago I told my wifewe gotta be working the
biggest story on the planet.<i>Boston Globe.</i><i>Boston Globe.</i>
One moment, please.Yes, if you have a tip,
I will transfer you down to Metro.Mitchell Garabedian.<i>Mitch, it's Mike,
I've been trying to reach you.</i>I don't have time to talk to you,
Mr. Rezendes.Hey, just quickly,
did you refile those docs yet?<i>No, I just
got the order. It takes time.</i>Okay, great. Can you hold
off on refiling them?<i>Hold off?</i>
I have to go to Florida.Once you refile
they're public.Other newspapers will be
able to get a hold of 'em.<i>Other newspapers are not my concern.
I received a judicial order.</i><i>I told you the Church
is watching me.</i>Oh, hey, Mitch, please.
All I need's a few more weeks.<i>I can't make any promises.
Goodbye.</i>Mitch? Mitch! Shit!Shit.<i>Look, I get it,
no one wants to read</i><i>about kids getting
raped by priests.</i>Especially now.But you asked a lot
of people to relivesome very
painful experiences,and you just disappear.Phil, you know why we were
taken off of the story.It's been six weeks
since 9/11.I realize that and we're
gonna get back to it.When?You're doing the same thing
you guys did last time.No.
You're dropping us.No. Maybe I should tell
the <i>Herald</i> that story.Okay, Phil,
you go ahead and do that.It will undo all the work we've done,
but I can't stop you.Listen to me.
I am here because I care.We're not going away.We're gonna tell this story,
we're gonna tell it right.We just need a little more time.
That's all we're asking for.Why bother asking?You're gonna do
what you want anyway.You always do.Phil.Phil.Hey.<i>How's South Beach?</i>Boynton Beach.
Remarkably different place.What's up?<i>Mitch Garabedian
called me today.</i>Why'd he call you?
<i>'Cause he knew you'd yell at him.</i><i>He refiled the docs.</i>What?Robby, those docs
are public now.<i>We gotta get there
before anyone else does.</i>I know. I know. I know.Just wrap up
whatever you're doingand get
the first flight out.<i>I'll book a flight now and go
straight to the courthouse tomorrow.</i>All right. Call me when you get in.
<i>Okay.</i>Robby, I'd like to let Phil Saviano
know that we're back on it.Good idea.Go have dinner with Hansi.Might be the last time
for a while.Mmm-hmm.Robby, after
we saw Macleish,I started going
back through the clips,and I had a little time
last week finally.So, um, I found that.It's from '93.That it?Yeah. Yeah, that's it.Good night.Okay, good night.So, I was probably a few
years after you, right?No, you were
more than a few.Believe me.Well, after BC High,
I came down to Providenceand played hockey
for the Friars.Oh, well, you must
have been pretty good.No. Rode the bench in college.
Yeah. Oh.But I loved the city.Oh.
And we just had our third kid.And I still get my <i>Globe,</i>
for the record.Oh, that's good to know.
Good to know.Look, Kevin, uh,
that's actually why I'm here.I need to ask you some
questions about Father Talbot.How'd you find out?Well...I guess
it doesn't matter.And I never even
told my wife.Excuse me.Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I need to get in there.We're closed. Come on, let me in.
Five minutes.I'm sorry, we're closed.Come on. Five minutes.Hello.Here.This is the Geoghan case?
That's right.Those records are sealed.
No.That's a public motion.
Those records are public.Look, I work for the <i>Globe.</i>Good for you.Can I talk to
your supervisor?He's not in today.What about a judge?There must be judges that
work on this kind of thing.Sixth floor.We understand the nature of the
allegations against Father Talbot.I'm just not sure what you
want from President Kemeza.Talbot taught here long
before Bill took over.Mmm. Of course.
We just want to knowif it's possible
that the president,the faculty, the board,that no one knew what was
going on at the time.I graduated in 1979, and I had
no idea about any of this.So if you're suggesting that
Father Gibbons and Father Callahanhad in any way...Gibbons and Callahan...I mean, they ran this
place like the navy.Do you really think
they didn't know?It's a big school, Robby.
You know that.And we're talking about
seven alleged victimsover, what, eight years.We're talking about
seven that we know about.This is ridiculous.You're reaching for a story here.
We cannot possibly...Jack. Jack. Jack.
If I had been president then,I would've known.Bill, I'm not sure
that's relevant.Why do you think they sent
Talbot up to Cheverus?You know they
wanted him out of town.Robby, as well
intentioned as Bill's remarks are,I'm hoping we can
keep this between usuntil we all get
on the same page.Is that why we're here,
to get on the same page?No, we're here because you're
an important alumnus, Robby,and a friend.Exactly, and we know you care about
this school as much as we do.Did you play
a sport here, Jack?Yeah. Football. Why?Mmm. I ran track.You know, I went to
Providence yesterdayto talk to one of
Father Talbot's victims.He played hockey here.And, uh, he's one
of the better ones.He's got a wife,
kids, good job.About 10 minutes
into the conversation,the guy breaks down.You know,
couldn't stop crying.Said he could never figure out
why Father Talbot picked him.Father Talbot
coached the hockey team.So,I guess we just got lucky.You and me.Does Jack Dunn
work for the school?No, he's PR
for Boston College.They call him
when they need help.And Pete Conley?
Why was he there?Good question.Pete's a big alum,
but I called Bill directly,and I asked
for a sit-down.I never mentioned
anybody else.It's like everybody
already knows the story.Yeah.Except us.
And we work right there.Judge Volterra?
Yes.Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>Um, I'm having
some troubleaccessing some
public recordsdown in the
records room.I was wondering if I could
have a word with you?All right.
Thank you.Thank you very much.These exhibits you're after,
Mr. Rezendes,they're very
sensitive records.With all due respect,
Your Honor,that's not the question.The records are public.Maybe so, but tell me,where's the editorial
responsibilityin publishing
records of this nature?Well, where's the editorial
responsibility in not publishing them?You can't take those.
You need to make copies.I'm going to the copy room.It closed at 4:00.Look, I'll give you83 bucks to use yours.Hey, cabbie!Hey! Hey! Hey!Take me to <i>The Boston Globe</i>
on Morrissey Boulevard.Don't take 93.
Take Dorchester Avenue.<i>Robby, it's incredible!</i><i>Law knew about Geoghan for years,
no question.</i><i>There's a letter to Law
from a woman Margaret Gallant,</i><i>who lived in Jamaica Plain in the
early '80s when Geoghan was there.</i><i>Listen to this,</i><i>""Our family is
rooted in the Church,</i><i>""our desire is to
protect the Holy Orders,</i><i>""even in the midst
of our agony</i><i>""over the seven boys
in our family</i><i>""who have been violated.""</i><i>Seven, Robby. Seven boys.</i><i>""It was suggested
we keep silent.</i><i>""We did not question the authority
of the Church two years ago,</i><i>""but since Father Geoghan
is still in his parish...""</i><i>But she sent it to Law,
and Law did shit.</i><i>Here's another one to Law, same year.
Listen to this,</i><i>""A word on the recent
assignment of Father Geoghan</i><i>""as an associate
at St. Julia's in Weston.</i><i>""Father Geoghan has a history of
homosexual involvement with young boys.</i><i>""I understand his recent
departure from St. Brendan's</i><i>""may be related
to this problem.</i>""I wonder if Father Geoghan should
not be reduced to just weekend work""while receiving
some kind of therapy.""You know how grateful I am to
you for your constant concern.""Sincerely yours in our Lord,""Most Reverend John M. Darcy,
Auxiliary Bishop of Boston.""December 7, 1984.""An auxiliary bishop
wrote that?That's incredible.He broke ranks.I mean,
when did Gallant write her letter?1984.
And Law just ignored it.How do you ignore
that freakin' letter?We got 'em.You can't read these letters and
think anything else. It's proof.Yeah. It is.This is good work.Should we
take it up to Ben?Uh...No. Not yet.Why not?
We got Law. This is it.No, this is Law
covering for one priest.There's another
90 out there.Yeah, and we'll print
that story when we get it,but we gotta go with this now.No, I'm not going to
rush this story, Mike.We don't have
a choice, Robby.If we don't rush to print,somebody else is gonna find these
letters and butcher the story.Joe Quimby from the <i>Herald</i>was at the
freakin' courthouse.So we'll write
a holding story,and we'll keep our
eye on the <i>Herald.</i>Keep our eye on the <i>Herald?</i>They run this and they get it wrong,
the Church will bury it.We gotta do this now.
Mike, Mike...What? Why are we hesitating?Baron told us to get Law.
This is Law.Baron told us to
get the system.We need the full scope.That's the only thing
that will put an end to this.Then let's take it up
to Ben, let him decide.We'll take it to Ben
when I say it's time.It's time, Robby. It's time!They knew and they
let it happen. To kids!Okay? It could've been you!
It could've been me!It could have been any of us!We gotta nail these scumbags!We gotta show people that
nobody can get away with this!Not a priest or a Cardinal
or a freaking Pope!You finished?Yeah, I am. This is bullshit.Oh...You okay?Mmm...Hey, Hansi.Hard day at work, Mike?Here.
Thank you.I don't know why
I got so pissed off.You know, I think
Robby's wrong.You know, you're just...You care about the story, Mike.
We all do.- Yeah, I guess.
- Mmm.I stopped going to
church with my Nana.It was...
It was too hard.You know,
I'd be sitting there,and I'd start thinking
about Joe Crowleyor someone else and I just...I just got so angry.Did you tell her why?She goes to church
three times a week, Mike.It really pisses me off.You know,I actually really liked going to
church when I was a little kid.Mmm.Why'd you stop?Typical shit.But the weird thing is,I think I...I think I figured that maybe one day...I would actually go back.I was really...
I was holding on to that.Mmm.I read those letters, and...And something just cracked.It's a shitty feeling.
Yeah.It's a shitty feeling.Looks like a long day.Hey, Pete.
I'm sorry to make it longer.Brian.Has anyone ever said no
to a drink with you, Pete?Well, sure.
But the trick is to keep asking.For Boston.Boston.Mmm.So, you here
for the Cardinal?Oh, no, no, no, no.
I wouldn't...I wouldn't presume to speak
for the Cardinal. No.You know,you got a lot of people here
who respect you, Robby,the work you do.That's good to know.You know, it's because you
care about this place.It's why you do what you do.
It's who you are.You know,
but people need the Church,more than ever right now.You know, you can feel it.And the Cardinal...You know, the Cardinal,
he might not be perfect,but we can't
throw out all the goodhe's doing over
a few bad apples.Now, you know,
I'm bringing this up to youbecause I know this is
Baron's idea, his agenda.I gotta tell ya,
I mean, honest to God,I mean, he doesn't care about
this city the way we do.I mean, how could he?This is how it happens, isn't it, Pete?
What's that?A guy leans on a guy,and suddenly
the whole townjust looks
the other way.Robby. Robby, look it,Marty Baron is just
trying to make his mark.He's gonna be here for a couple
of years, and he's gonna move on.Just like he did in
New York and Miami.Where're you gonna go?Hmm?Good night, Robby.
Brian.Hey, Pete.
Yeah?Uh...When we do run the story, uh, I'm gonna
need a comment from the Cardinal.We'll talk again later.
Good night, Robby.Good night, Pete.Robby.What?No shit. When?Okay. Yeah.Hey!What's up?Sweeney ruled
in our favor.She ruled to unseal
the documents.Jeez!The Church has already
filed an appeal,but the trial court ruling is
generally upheld in these matters.And when would we
get the documents?Probably takes Cohen
a few weeks to rule,then there's
a redaction process.Uh, I'd say they'd be
made public mid-January.Okay.
All right.Thanks, Jon.
You bet.Nice work.
Thanks.Metro should run
something, Marty.We can't run
this one big.Why wouldn't we?
It's a major First Amendment victory.Not to mention,
you getan Irish Catholic judgeruling against the Church?- That's a hell of a precedent.
- Mmm-hmm.We don't want the <i>Herald</i>
going deep on this.Why's that?You're gonna have
to step out, Peter.I'm not stepping out.Peter.When did you, uh...
A couple of weeks ago.A couple of weeks?- Yeah.
- And you're telling us now?These are substantial.They clearly show
that Law was negligent.I need more time.
I wanna keep digging.For what?
This is the goddamn story.It's not
the whole story.Tough shit.
We're on a clock now.Even if we don't
run Sweeney's ruling,another paper could find these
letters and fuck the story.Agreed.But we run
these letters alone,Law apologizes,
says it's a one-time thing.He can bury it.How? These clearly show he
knew and did nothing about it.Look, I'm close to
stories on 70 priests.We nail that,
along with those letters,this is proof
this is bigger than Law.It's the whole system.You have multiple sources
confirming all those priests?On some. I can get more.Too risky. If we're not buttoned
up on every single one of them,the Church will pick us apart.I think I can get us someonefrom the other
side of the aisle.Somebody inside the Church?Yeah, a lawyer.Will he go on the record?Deep background.
But he's a solid source.Rezendes needs time
to write the story.We don't wanna drop it at
Christmas, not after 9/11.We could run it
just after New Year's,before they release
the rest of the documents.All right.Tell Canellos to bury
the ruling in Metro.You got six weeks.Thank you.Tell Mike I want
a draft by Christmas.And we need a response
from Lake Street.Who does PR for the Cardinal?
Still John Walsh?No, somebody new,
Donna Morrisey.She came from TV.
She's young.Good, get a quote.We need something from Law
to appear even-handed.Robby, next time give
me a goddamn heads-up.Will do.<i>Silent night, holy night</i><i>All is calm</i><i>All is bright</i><i>Round yon virgin,
mother and child</i><i>Holy infant,
so tender and mild</i><i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i><i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i><i>Silent night, holy night</i><i>Shepherds quake</i><i>At the sight</i><i>Glory streams

sing Hallelujah</i>Oh, Robby.
What a nice surprise.Come on in.Hey, hon, look who
I found outside.Karen, can you
give us a minute?Sure.Good to see you, Karen.What's up?I'm out of time, Jim.We've got cover-up
stories on 70 priests,but the boss
isn't gonna run itunless I get confirmation
from your side.Are you out of your mind?Come on.
This is our town, Jimmy.Everybody knew something was going on,
and no one did a thing.We gotta put an end to it.Don't tell me
what I gotta do.Yeah, I helped defend these scumbags,
but that's my job, Robby.I was doing my job!Yeah.You and everyone else.Get out of my house.Hey!You come to my home
and lay this shit on me!You were right, Robby.We all knew somethin'
was going on.So where were you?What took you so long?I don't know, Jim.Give me the list.Larry, we're going
to press in six hours.Donna Morrisey
said she'd called uswith a quote
from Law hours ago.That's what I thought.
When did you talk to her?Okay, okay, Larry.Yeah. Yeah, that's
good to know.Thanks, Pete.
Anything?Conley said Donna Morrisey should have
called, he just left Lake Street.Yeah, Rasky said
the same thing.This is ridiculous. You'd think
they'd wanna get ahead of this.I mean, they'd be
idiots not to.I would love to see their faces
when they read this thing then.You know, Sunday's the
feast of the Epiphany.It seems appropriate.Mike Rezendes.Hey, Donna.
Thanks for calling.Yeah, I just had a few questions
if you have a minute.What?What?
Another adjective.Anything?
Law just turned us down.Jesus Christ.I just got off the phone
with Donna Morrisey.She said, quote,
we don't even want to knowwhat the questions are,
end quote.She really said that?
Yeah.Well, that oughta do it.""The Church
had no interest""in knowing what the <i>Globe's</i>
questions would be.""Work it in somewhere before the jump.
Anything else?Uh, Matt wants to put
the letters online,so the readers can
see for themselves.We can run the URL at the
bottom of the article.It's pretty straightforward.
Okay.We also put the Spotlight tip
line at the end of the storyso people can call in.Goes directly to our office.Matt and I can go in in the
morning in case we get any calls.Yeah, I'm more concerned about
the phones at reception.After we ran
the Porter case,the message centers
were tied up for weeks.It's a real problem.
There were picketers, too.Lots of 'em.I'll talk to Richard about
the security and the phones.Uh, how are we coming
on the folo story?Well, we've nailed
down multiple storieson 70 priests.- All 70?
- Mmm-hmm.And with the confirmation from
Robby's source, we're ready to go.We can have
a draft next week.Uh, Robby, that
source of yours,is it something
we could revisit?He might be tough.But he has no problem
helping the Churchprotect dozens
of dirty priests.Guy's a scumbag.
He's a lawyer, he's doing his job.He's a shill
for the Church.He knew
and did nothing.He could've said something years ago.
Maybe saved some lives.What about us?What's that
supposed to mean?We had all the pieces.Why didn't we get it sooner?We didn't have
all the pieces.We had Saviano,
we had Barrett, we had Geoghan.We had the directories
in the basement.You know what?
We got it now.Robby, the story
needed Spotlight.Mike, Spotlight's
been around since 1970.So what? We couldn't see the scope of this.
No one could.Robby, this started
with one goddamn priest.Macleish sent us a letter
on 20 priests, years ago.Sacha found the clip.You freaking kidding me?
20 priests?When?Uh, just after Porter.
December '93.We buried the story
in Metro. No folo.That was you.You were Metro.Yeah. That was me.I'd just taken over.
I don't remember it at all.But yeah...Um...Can I say something here?Sometimes it's
easy to forgetthat we spend most of our time
stumbling around in the dark.Suddenly a light
gets turned on,and there's a fair share
of blame to go around.I can't speak to what
happened before I arrived,but, um, all of you have done
some very good reporting here.Reporting that I believe
is gonna have an immediateand considerable
impact on our readers.For me, this kind of story
is why we do this.Having said that, Cardinal Law
and the Catholic communityare gonna have a very
strong response to this.So if you need a moment,you've earned it.But I will need you
back here Monday morningfocused and ready
to do your job.Leaving?Yeah.I, uh, just got a call
from the Cardinal.Really. Why?He wanted to
tell me personallythat he decided
not to comment.Yeah, said he wanted to
extend me that courtesy.Jesus, the balls on that guy.
What did you say?I told him he was
making a mistake,and that we were
gonna run the story.Damn right we're
gonna run it.Sacha, can I have
a drink of water?Yeah. Sure, Nana. Yeah.Can I keep this?Sure.I thought you
should see it first.Thank you for
bringing it by.I have some clients
I have to attend to.Both kids were abused.Jamaica Plain.
Two weeks ago.Keep doing your work,
Mr. Rezendes.- Hello.
- Hello.How are you guys doing?
We're good.Good.Hey.
Morning.How'd you sleep?Not very well. You?I haven't slept well for months.
Mmm.Oh, thanks.
I actually started writing.Writing?
Yeah, I've been working on a book.Gives me something
else to focus on.What kind of book?Horror.Spotlight.Yeah.
Yeah, of course.Can I get your
name, please?You do know
it's Sunday, right?I couldn't get
a tee time.No picketers.
Yeah.Probably still at church.Hey, Linda.It's quiet, huh?Yeah, easiest
overtime I ever made.Phone hasn't rung once.Marty sent two of mine
down to Spotlight.- Great article, guys.
- Thank you.Spotlight?Okay. Send him over.Spotlight,
can I help you?Phones have been
ringing all morning.Mike, can you grab that?
Yeah, yeah.They're almost
all victims, Robby.I'm sorry
to make you wait.It's very tough to
talk about, I know...Yes, you can
reach me here...This is Spotlight.Spotlight."
It Happened One Night|1934|98|Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable, Walter Connolly, Jason Thomas|Frank Capra|"Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.- Sending meals up to her regularly?
- Yes, sir.Why don't you jam it down her throat?It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.Yes, sir.I won't eat a thing
until you let me off this boat.Come now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.Not this time, you won't!
I'm already married to him.You'll never live
under the same roof with him.I'll see to it.Get it through your head,
King Westley and I are married!Definitely, legally, actually married!
It's over, it's finished.There's not a thing you can do about it.
I'm over 21 and so is he.While you've been onboard......I've arranged to
have your marriage annulled.Annulled. I'll have something to say
about that and so will King.I expect him to.The vittles. Come in.I told you not to bring any food in here.Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.Put it down here.Smart, aren't you? So subtle.Strategy, my dear.Was it strategy sending
those gorillas to drag me away......from the Justice of the Peace?Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.I've won many arguments that way.Besides not liking him,
you haven't got a thing against King.- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best flyers in the country.He's no good.
You married him because I said not to.You're always telling me what not to do.Because you've always been
a stubborn idiot.I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.Don't shout so.
You may work up an appetite.I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!All right, scream.Let me off this boat or I'll break
every piece of furniture in here!Here, now.Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
You don't have to eat it.Just smell it. It's a poem.Lower the boats! Catch her!Come on, men!She got away, sir.Of course, she's too smart for you.Send a wireless
to the Lovington Detective Agency.""Daughter escaped again.""Watch roads,
airports and train stations in Miami.""All aboard!
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville......New York, Philadelphia.We're wasting our time.
Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus.I told the old man it was bunk.Ticket for New York, please.- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.Thank you.What's going on here?
I'd like to use that phone.Go away. This is history in the making.- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.Heel, boy.I can't stand this any longer.In a pig's eye, you will.Listen monkey face, when you fired me,
you fired the best news hound......your filthy scandal sheet ever had.You wouldn't know a newspaper story
if it kicked you in the pants.I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna write it in Greek?I'd start a new department.That was free verse,
you gas house palooka.What was free about it?
It cost this paper a gob of dough.And it's not going to cost us any more!Gordon.Did you know he reversed the charge?What? Why you....When you get back to New York,
you keep far away from this office.You're fired. You don't work here
anymore and you never will.What'd he say?So, you're changing your tune?You're late with your apologies.I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged me on your hands and knees!I hope this'll be a lesson to you.Did we tell that baby?- We don't need anymore of his lip.
- You told him, Pete.I guess he knows now,
how I feel about his job.I bet he does, too.Is my chariot ready?Your chariot awaiteth withouteth,
mighty King.- Lead on, sire.
- Make way for the king.Make way for the king.Long live the king.Philadelphia, all aboard!Step down Marty, King is back.On the rack in the back.
It's your goodbye chariot.Make hams of you and scram!Two thousand miles is a long trip.Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.Pillow, sir?Driver! If you'll be good enough
to move those newspapers, I'll have a seat.Hey, wait a minute!What do you think you're doing?The papers. What's the idea of
throwing them out?The papers? It's a long story, my friend.I never did like the idea
of sitting on newspapers.I did it once, and all the headlines
came off on my white pants.It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.They followed me all over town and read
the news off the seat of my pants.A fresh guy. What you need is
a good sock on the nose.Listen partner,
you may not like my nose, but I do.I always wear it out in the open so......if anybody wants to
take a sock at it, they can.Yeah?Now, that's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?Our conversation could have been over
long ago.Yeah?If you keep that up,
we won't get anywhere.Yeah?You got me. Yeah!Excuse me, lady.
But that upon which you sit is mine.I beg your pardon?Now listen,
I put up a stiff fight for that seat.So, if it's just the same to you, scram.Driver, are these seats reserved?- No. First come, first serve.
- Thank you.These seats accommodate two people,
don't they?Maybe they do, maybe they don't.Thank you.Move over.This is a ""maybe they do.""If you'd ask me real nice,
I might put that bag up there for you.Next time you drop in, bring your folks.Get some! Come on, everybody!Hot dogs, folks!Rest station, 15 minutes.
We'll only be here 15 minutes.Red hot coffee!Right around there.Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!He got away.I found myself in the middle of brush
and no sign of the skunk.I don't know what you're raving about,
young man.- Furthermore, I'm not interested.
- Well of all the....Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag is gone.My heavens! It's gone!I knew you'd catch on eventually.- What am I going to do now?
- Don't tell me your ticket was in it.No, got that all right. But not my money.
All I have here is $4.You can wire home
for money in Jacksonville.No, I can't.- Yes, I guess I will.
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag.
The company should pay for it.- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported!That's silly.
The company will take care of it.Can you understand English?
Would you please keep out of my affairs?I want to be left alone.Why, you ungrateful brat.Board!All aboard!Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.Only 30 minutes for breakfast.Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.Read all about it!I'm so sorry.Silly, isn't it?Why, everybody's gone!Thank you for that, very much.- We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
- Yes.That was foolish of me.Why didn't you shove me away?I hated to wake you up.
You look kind of pretty asleep.How about some breakfast?No thank you. No, I'm going
to the Windsor Hotel.Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in a half an hour.No, they'll wait for me.Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Be sure to wait for me.Yeah?Yes.Where's the bus to New York?It left about 20 minutes ago.But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.Good morning. Remember me?
I'm the fellow you slept on last night.Seems to me,
I've already thanked you for that.What time's the next bus?8:00 tonight.8:00? That's 12 hours.Sorry, miss.What's wrong?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?Why are you so excited?
You missed it, too.Yeah, I missed it too.Don't tell me you did it on my account.I hope you haven't any idea
that what happened last night is....Young man,
you needn't concern yourself about me.I can take care of myself.You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here's your ticket.My ticket?I found it on the seat.Thank you.
It must have fallen out of my purse.You'll never get away with it,
Miss Andrews.- What are you talking about?
- You won't get away with it.Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.You must have me confused
with someone else.Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.I've always been curious to know......what kind of a girl would marry
a front-page aviator like King Westley.Take my advice. Grab the next bus back
to Miami. That guy's a phoney.I didn't ask for your advice.That's right. You didn't.You're not going to notify my father,
are you?What for?You probably could get
some money out of him.I never thought of that.If you promise not to do it,
I'll pay you as much as he will.You won't gain a thing by giving me up.I'm willing to make it worth your while.I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.It's very important to me.I'd pay you now, only......all I had when I jumped off
the yacht was a watch.I had to pawn it to get these clothes.I'll give you my address.
You can contact me in New York.Never mind.I had you pegged right from the jump.Just the spoiled brat of a rich father.
The only way you get anything is to buy it.You're in a jam and all you can think of is
your money. It never fails, does it?Ever hear of the word ""humility""?No, you wouldn't.It never occurred to you to say......""Please, Mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?""That'd bring you down off your high horse.I'll tell you something to ease your mind.You don't have to worry about me.I'm not interested in your money
or your problem.You, King Westley, your father.
You're all a lot of hooey to me.You send telegrams here?I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?""To Joe Gordon,
in care of New York Mail, New York.""Am I laughing. The biggest scoop
of the year just dropped in my lap.""I know where Ellen Andrews is.""
No, do you really?Go on. Send the telegram.""How would you like to have the story?
You big tub of....""Mush.""Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.""What I said about never writing
another line for you still goes.""Are you burning? Peter Warne.""That'll be $2.60.- Send it collect.
- Collect?Collect.Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston,
Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond......Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York....Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley.
May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.Gets tiresome.
Especially for somebody like you.You look like you've got class.Yes, with a capital ""K"". I'm the guy
that knows class when he sees it.Believe you me. Ask any of the boys.
They'll tell you.Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.Shapeley's the name
and that's the way I like them.You made no mistake sitting next to me.Most girls you meet on the bus......ain't nothing to write home
to the wife about.You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.You can't be too particular, neither.What's the matter, you ain't saying much?Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.That's pretty good. ""Seems to me you're
doing excellently without any assistance.""Well shut my big, nasty mouth.Looks like you're one up on me.There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama......that can snap back at you.
The colder they are, the hotter they get.That's what I always say.Yes, sir.When a cold mama gets hot,
boy how she sizzles.Now you're just my type.Believe me, sister,
I could go for you in a big way.""Fun-on-the-side Shapeley,"" they call me.
With accent on the ""fun"". Believe you me.Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.Looks like you're two up on me now.Hey, you.- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?I'd like to sit next to my wife,
if you don't mind.- Your wife?
- Yes.Come on.Yeah. Sure, excuse me.
You know, I was just....Sure. Excuse me, miss.
I was just trying to make things pleasant.Excuse me, I....I didn't mean anything, Doc.- No offence, Doc.
- No.If you promise not to snap my head off,
I'd like to thank you.Forget it. I didn't do it for you.
His voice gets on my nerves.What'd you do all day?Ran in and out of doorways.
Trying to keep out of the rain.Your clothes are all wet.Here.You're as helpless as a baby.Thank you.Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes,
chewing gum, candy, magazines.Here, boy.- Yes, ma'am.
- A box of chocolates, please.- Never mind. She doesn't want it.
- But....- Of course, I do. What do you mean?
- Beat it.Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!$1 .60.You had $4 last night.How will you get to New York at this rate?That's none of your business.You're on a budget from now on.- Just a minute. You can't--
- Shut up.- What's the matter, officer?
- Bridge washed out.Looks like we can't get through
till morning.If any passengers want a place to sleep......you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?Dyke's Auto camp.All right, thanks. Hey, brat.Are you talking to me?Yeah. Come on,
we're stopping here for the night.Hey! Come on, we're all set.Good evening. Hope you
and your husband rest comfortable.Come on! What are you going to do,
stay out there all night?Darn clever, these Armenians?Yeah, it's a gift.I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my husband.Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that.
I registered as Mr. and Mrs.You did?What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?I kind of half expected you to thank me.Your ego is absolutely colossal.Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?You know, compared to you,
my friend Shapeley's an amateur.Just whatever gave you any idea
I'd stand for this?Now wait a minute.
Let's get this straightened out right now.If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.You're just a headline to me.A headline?You're not a newspaper man, are you?Chalk up one for your side.Now listen. You want to
get to King Westley, don't you?All right, I'm here to help you.
What I want is your story.Exclusive. A day-to-day account.
All about your mad fight to happiness.I need that story.
Between you and me, I've got to have it.Isn't that just too cute.There's a brain behind that face of yours,
isn't there?You've got everything nicely figured out
for yourself. Including this.This? Well, that's a matter
of simple mathematics.These cabins cost $2 a night.
I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear......but the family purse won't stand
for our having separate establishment.Thank you very much, sir.
You've been very kind.It's all right with me.
Go on out in the storm.But I'm going to follow you.Yeah.And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn
you over to your old man. Right now.Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.A simple story for simple people.You behave yourself,
I'll see you get to King Westley.If not,
I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.Now, which of these beds do you prefer?This one? All right.That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.This?I like privacy when I retire.
Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.Prying eyes annoy me.Behold the walls of Jericho.Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.But a lot safer.You see, I have no trumpet.Now to show you
my heart's in the right place......I'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.Do you mind joining the Israelites?You don't want to join the Israelites?All right. Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.No two men do it alike.I once knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.Now he made a picture.Years later, his secret came out.
He wore a toupee.I have a method all my own.If you'll notice, the coat came first.
Then the tie. Then the shirt.Now, according to Hoyle,
after that the pants should be next.There's where I'm different.I go for the shoes next.First the right. Then the left.After that, it's every man for himself.Still with me, brat?Don't be a sucker.A good night's rest will do you
a lot of good.Besides, you got nothing to worry about.The walls of Jericho will protect you
from the big bad wolf.""Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
The big bad wolf""The big bad wolf""She's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra, la, la, la, la""Would you mind please,
putting out the light?No, not at all.I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.Excuse me.By the way, what's your name?What's that?Who are you?Who, me?I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.You've got a name, haven't you?Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.Peter Warne.I don't like it.Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.- Another message, sir.
- What is it? What is it?It's from Charleston.
""Checking every northbound train.""Also assigned 20 operators
to watch main highways.""No sign of her yet.
Will continue to do all possible.""Signed, Lovington Detective Agency.""It's just the same as all the others.- Yes, sir?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.- What are we crawling for?
- I got it wide open.- All right, step on it.
- Yes, sir.I hope she's all right.All right? Of course, she's all right.
What could happen to her?- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it.Hello?Hey, mister.Hello.What's the matter, you not up yet?- What time is it?
- 8:00. Here.It's a toothbrush, thanks.My dress, you had it pressed.Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?I'll count to 10.
If you're not out of bed by then......I'll drag you out myself.- One, two, three, four, five....
- I really think you would!I'm out! I'm out!You'll find the showers
just behind the second cottage.Outside?All the best homes have them outside.I can't go out like this.- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.Here, use mine.Thanks.Make it snappy.Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.- Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.Where'd you say the showers were?Here's a towel.Thank you.You're kind of little, aren't you?Where's the shower?Your hair's cute like that.
You should never comb it.I'll find it myself.Are the showers in there?They ain't out here.Thank you.Can't a body have a little privacy
around here?You want a shower around here,
you'll stand in line.Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?Say, I'm sorry about last night.Didn't know you was married to that guy.
You should've told me right off.High time you got back.I met some very interesting women
at the showers.We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.Come on. Sit down.My, my. Scrambled eggs.Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.Any complaints?No. No complaints.I'd have cream for your coffee,
but I'd be buying a whole pint.You don't have to apologise to me.You don't know how much
I appreciate all this.What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?Must be the spring.I thought maybe ""believe you me""
told you some more snappy stories.No. He apologised for last night.
Said he didn't know we were married.Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.- Donut?
- Thanks.You think this whole business is silly?Running away and all.No. Makes too good a story.Yes, you do.
You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.Perhaps I am.
Although, I don't see how I can be.Spoiled people are used to
having their way.I never have. On the contrary.I've always been told what to do and how
to do it and when and with whom.Can you believe, this is the first time
I've ever been alone with a man?Yeah.It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.You're doing all right.Thanks.Nurses, governesses, chaperones,
even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.One consolation,
you can never get lonesome.It has its moments. It's become a sort of
game, trying to outwit father's detectives.I did once. Actually went shopping
without a bodyguard.It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.It didn't last long,
they found me in a department store.I was so mad, I ran out the back way
and jumped into the first car I saw.Guess who was in it?Santa Claus?Ghandi?King Westley was in it.- Is that how you met him?
- Yes.We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.By 6:00,
he was having all the rivers dragged.Where'd you learn to dunk,
in finishing school?Now don't you start telling me
I shouldn't dunk.Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how.Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long.
A dip and sock, into your mouth.You leave it in too long,
it gets soft and falls off.It's all a matter of timing.
I'll write a book about it.Thanks, professor.Just goes to show you. $20 million,
and you don't know how to dunk.I'd change places with
a plumber's daughter any day.How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.You can't go around bothering my tenants.
There's no girl by that name here.How do I know you're detectives?Show him your credentials, Mac.Detectives.That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?Maybe I can jump out of the window.
They won't see me.Get yourself all mussed up.Get your hair down over your eyes
and undo your buttons.I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.She said if we don't stop over
in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.What are you talking about?The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.She saw your sister on the street
the other day. Said she's looking swell.Come in.I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?Grandma says it's gonna be a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.Man here to see you, sweetheart.Who, me? You wanna see me?What's your name?- Are you addressing me?
- Yeah. What's your name?Wait a minute.
That's my wife you're talking to.What do you mean coming here?
What do you want?- We're looking for somebody.
- Fine, but don't come busting in here.This isn't a public park.I got news to take a sock at you.- Take it easy.
- The men are detectives.Even if they're the
whole police department......they can't bust in here,
questioning my wife.Don't get so excited.
He asked you a simple question.Is that so? How many times
have I told you not to butt in?You don't have to lose your temper!As usual. Every time I try to protect you.At the elks dance,
when that big Swede hit on you.He did not! I told you a million times.He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor.He didn't. You were drunk.Nuts! Just like your old man.Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.There ain't an ounce of
brains in your family.Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!- Shut up!
- You see what you've done?Sorry, but you see,
we've gotta check up on everybody.We're looking for a girl
named Ellen Andrews.Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.Too bad you're not looking for
a plumber's daughter.Quit bawling!I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple.You weren't bad, jumping in like that.- You've got a brain.
- You're not so bad, yourself.We could start a two-people
stock company.Things get tough,
we'll play to small town auditoriums.We'll call this one, ""The Great Deception.""What about ""Cinderella"" or
a real hot love story?No, too mushy.I like mushy stuff.Quit bawling!Bus leaves in five minutes!- What?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes.Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.I'm starting to think
you couldn't find your way home.This is the last session....- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.
Wait a minute. What does it say?""Have I got a story. Stop.
It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.""Hope you're the same.""- Collect?
- Yes.- If you accept another one, you're fired.
- Yes, sir.And that gives me an idea for all of you.I want action, Lovington, action.- We can't do the impossible.
- It isn't impossible.She's somewhere between here and Miami.
I want her found.- I put extra men on, the whole way.
- That's not enough.Send in Clark and Brown.- You sure she isn't with King Westley?
- No.He's being trailed 24 hours a day.He can't even get a phone call
we don't know about.I'm worried. After all,
something might have happened to her.I don't think so.Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.Coast-to-coast hook up.
Offer a reward of......$10,000 for information
on her whereabouts.Clark, send the story
to all of the newspapers.Some out-of-town papers
may not have a picture of her.Wire this to them.
I want the story to break right away.Now we'll get some action!Fine, that's fine.You know that one
about the man who flew on the trapeze?Yeah.""Once I was happy
but now I'm forlorn""Like an old coat
that is tattered and torn""Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn""Betrayed by a maid in her teens""This maid that I loved
she was handsome""And I tried all I knew how to please""But I never could please her
one-quarter so well""As the man on the flying trapeze""He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease""The daring young man
on the flying trapeze""His actions are graceful,
all the girls he does please""And my love he has stolen away""I know the second verse there.""Now he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse""His eyes would undress
every girl in the house""Perhaps he is better described as a louse
And still people came just the same""Now he smiles from the bar
on the people below""And one night he smiled on my love""She blew him a kiss""And she hollered bravo
And he hung by his schnozzle from above""He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease""Daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful""All the girls he does please
And my love he has stolen away""Do you mind if I take the third one?""I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks""While she spent her time
with the circus' freaks""The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks""Alas, Alack and Alaska""I went to this fellow
the villain, and I said""I'll see that you get your deserts""His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer""He sneered once again and said no""He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease""That daring young man
on the flying trapeze""His actions are graceful
The girls he does please""My love he has stolen away""- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.It's the first comfortable position
I've been in all night.""She flies through the air
with the greatest of ease""The daring young--""What's the matter with you?
Somebody help.Something happened to her.Look how pale she is.Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.Don't worry. She'll be all right.We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.What happened to your money?Ma spent it all on the tickets.
We didn't know it was gonna be so much.We shouldn't have come, I guess.But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York......and if we didn't go, she might lose it.She'll be all right
when she's had something to eat.The next time we come to,
you buy some food. Now come on.I shouldn't ought to take this.
Ma'll get mad.Don't tell her.
You don't want her to get sick again.No, but you might need it.Come on.I got millions.Here.- Thanks.
- Come on, go back.Better phone for some help.Go phone if you want to.
The nearest town is 10 miles away.Yeah?Say, buddy.
Like to take a look at my paper?Travelling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.Take that story there, for instance.If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?No.I'd go fifty-fifty with you.Why?Because I don't believe in hogging.A bird that figures that way
always ends up behind the eight ball.That's what I always say.What's on your mind?Five G's or I crab the works.Let's get away from here
and talk this over privately.I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.Lucky thing, my running into you.
Just the man I need.- You made no mistake, believe me.
- I can use a smart guy like you.- When you're talking to old man Shapeley...
- Can you make a gat?Huh?A gat. A rod.- Got any fireworks on you?
- No.I got a couple of machine guns
in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.May have trouble up north.
Have to shoot it out with the cops.If you manage, those five G's
are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.Killer?Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.You're not kidnapping her, are you?What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?$10, 000? Chicken feed.Now listen, we're holding that dame
for a million smackers.Say, I didn't know it was anything like this.
You see, I've got....What's the matter? You getting yellow?I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids.
I can't afford to get....Pipe down your mug before I....What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?Listen, you're into this thing
and you're staying in, get me?You know too much.I won't say anything, honest I won't.How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.- Why should I take a chance with you?
- Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.Yeah?What's your name?Oscar Shapeley.- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.Got a couple of kids?Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl.- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.You wouldn't. You're not thinking of--- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure.- If you don't....
- I'll keep my trap shut. I will.You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?Bugs Dooley? No.He was a nice guy, just like you.
And he made a big mistake one day.Got a little too talkative.- You know what happened to his kid?
- No.I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard
about it he blew his brains out.That's terrible.He had it coming to him.
He talked too much. I never talk.I never say a word. Word of honour.I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.Okay. Just remember that.Now beat it.Sure, mister. Thanks.
I always knew you guys were--Come on, scram.
And stay away from that bus.Sure. Anything you say.- You wouldn't shoot me in the back?
- If you don't beat it....I'm going.What's wrong?
Why do we have to leave the bus?Come on. Don't ask so many questions.Why?Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have
frightened him like that.At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.Why did we have to leave the bus?When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?I've been doing a little thinking myself.The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.What's the matter, are you weakening?No. I was just thinking of you.
A starvation diet may not agree with you.Did you give that child all your money?I gave him nothing.
You were the big-hearted gal.All the money I had was that ten spot.So I've been thinking
you better wire your father.No, sir. I started out for New York
and I'm going to get there......if I have to starve all the way.Okay.What is this strange power
this man Westley has over you women?Here, take these.- Hold on to them. Get up on that log.
- That?Get up on the log.I wish you'd stop being playful.So sorry. You know, this is the first time
in years I've ridden piggyback.This isn't piggyback.- Of course it is.
- You're crazy.I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.My uncle has four children.
I've seen them ride piggyback.I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.I never knew a rich man
who could piggyback ride.You're prejudiced.Show me a good piggy backer.
I'll show you a real human.Take Abraham Lincoln for instance.
A natural born piggy backer.Where do you get off with
that stuffed-shirt family of yours?My father was a great piggy backer.Here, hold this a minute.Thank you.How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.This looks like the best spot.We're not going to sleep out here, are we?I don't know about you,
but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.Peter?What?I'm awfully hungry.It's just your imagination.No it isn't.I'm hungry and scared.You can't be hungry
and scared both at the same time.Well, I am.If you're scared,
it scares the hunger out of you.Not if you're more hungry than scared.All right, you win. Let's forget about it.I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.Holy smoke!
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?If I had any sense,
I'd be in New York by this time.What about your story?Taking a married woman
back to her husband.I turned out to be the prize sucker.All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.- Then take them off.
- What?All right, don't take them off.
Do what you please, but shut up about it.You're becoming awfully
disagreeable lately.You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.If being with me is so distasteful to you,
you can leave.You can leave any time you see fit.Nobody's holding you here.I can get along.Peter?Peter!- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!What's got into you? I left for a minute
to find you something to eat.I know but....Here, eat your head off.I don't want it now.- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but--But what?I was so scared, it scared the hunger--Holy jumping catfish.
You drive a guy crazy.It's liable to get chilly before morning.Better use this.What are you thinking about?By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.- Really?
- Yeah.I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.What did you say
we're supposed to be doing?Hitchhiking.You've given me a very good example
of the hiking.Where does the hitching come in?It's a little early yet. No cars out.If it's the same to you......I'm going to sit right here
and wait until they come.You got a toothpick?- What's the matter?
- I got hay in my teeth.No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here, I got a penknife, though.Now hold still.- Be careful.
- All right. Where is it?All right, now hold still.Here. Get it?Thanks.You should have swallowed that.
You won't have any breakfast, you know?You needn't rub it in.- What are you eating?
- Carrots.- Raw?
- Want one?No. Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?That's right, I forgot. The idea
of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?Have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.I hate the horrid things.I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
Now we let a car get away.And suppose nobody stops for us?They'll stop all right. It's a matter
of knowing how to handle them.And you're an expert I suppose.Expert. And I'll write a book
about it. Call it ""The Hitchhiker's Hail.""There's no end to your accomplishments,
is there?- You think it's simple?
- No.Well, it is simple.
It's all in that old thumb, see?Some people do it like this. Or like this.All wrong. Never get anywhere.The poor things.But that old thumb never fails.
It's all a matter of how you do it, though.Now you take No. 1, for instance.That's a short jerky movement, like this.
That shows independence.You don't care if they stop or not.
You got money.- Clever.
- No. 2, that's a little wider movement.Smile goes with this one, like this.That means you got a brand-new story
about the farmer's daughter.You figured that out all by yourself?That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip.
That's the pitiful one.When you're broke and hungry,
everything looks black.It's a long sweeping movement like this.
Gotta follow through, though.That's amazing.But it's no good,
if you haven't got a long face to go with it.Here comes a car.Okay. Now watch me.
I'm gonna use No. 1.Keep your eye on that thumb, baby,
and see what happens.I still got my eye on the thumb.Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try No. 2.When you get to 100, wake me up.I don't think I'll write that book after all.Think of all the fun you had, though.You mind if I try?You?Don't make me laugh.You're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.What are you gonna do?It's a system all my own.Aren't you going to give me a little credit?What for?I proved once and for all that
the limb is mightier than the thumb.Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.So, you're just married?
That's pretty good.But if I was young, that's the way
I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.Yes, sir. ""Hitchhiking down the highway""Of love on a honeymoon""Hitchhiking down the highway, down""Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?Tonsil? Me? No.Me burn a tonsil? ""My tonsils won't burn""All right, let it go.""Turn""How about a bite to eat?- That would be lovely.
- No thanks, we're not hungry.Young people in love are never hungry.No.""Young people in love""Are very seldom hungry""People in love are very seldom hungry""What were you going to do?
Gold dig that guy for a meal?Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.Eat a carrot.No.I'm going in to ask him.You do and I'll break your neck.Come on, let's get out of here.
Stretch our legs.I'm sorry....That's all right.Hey! Come here!You've got my suitcase!What happened to you? I was worried.- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!Well, what happened?A road thief. Picks people up,
runs off with their things. What a racket.How'd you get the car?I gave him a black eye for it
and had to tie him up to a tree.Can't be much gas left in this thing.Gotta start promoting some.Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.That'll be good for ten gallons.I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.I don't like you. Never have. Never will.Now that's clear enough, isn't it?You've made it evident
by your threats of annulment.It hasn't worried me for a minute.Ellie and I got married
because we love each other.She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned,
there's going to be no annulment.I see. You've got hold of a good thing
and you're going to hang on to it?All right, you win.
I'll just have to get used to you.I admit, I'm licked.
But it's only because I'm worried.If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.I could have helped if it hadn't been
for you. I've been watched so closely--I know. Well, you can help now.
I've got a room full of reporters in there.Now, I want you to make a statement.Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding.And that if she returns
I won't interfere with your marriage.- All right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.Okay.I hope you and your wife
spend a pleasant week with us.So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.Goodnight.- All right, brat.
- Any luck?Yeah. He finally agreed to let us
have a cabin.What about the money?I talked him out of that idea.
He thinks we're staying a week.- I must think something up before morning.
- That's swell.Yeah? I'm glad you think so.
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.I told you there's no use in staying here.
We can make New York in three hours.I thought you were in a hurry to get back.Whoever heard of getting in
at 3:00 in the morning?Everybody will be asleep.Okay. Cottage no. 6.There you go, trusting people again.
How many times did I tell you--But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.We're on the last lap.Tomorrow morning,
you'll be in the arms of your husband.Yeah.You'll have a great story, won't you?Yeah. Swell.Thanks.We certainly outsmarted your father.I guess you ought to be happy.Am I going to see you in New York?Nope.Why not?I don't make it a policy
to run around with married women.There's no harm in your coming to see us.Not interested.Won't I ever see you again?What for? I've served my purpose!I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?Have you ever been in love, Peter?Me?Yes.Haven't you ever thought about it at all?It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.Where are you gonna find her?Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.They don't come that way anymore.Have I ever thought about it?I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.I saw an island in the Pacific once.
Never been able to forget it.That's where I'd like to take her.She'd have to be the sort of a girl......who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.Nights when you,
the moon and the water all become one.You feel you're part
of something big and marvellous.That's the only place to live.The stars are so close overhead you feel
you could reach up and stir them around.I've been thinking about it.Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those things.Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.I want to do all those things
you talked about.You better go back to your bed.I love you. Nothing else matters.
But we can run away.Everything will take care of itself.
Please, Peter......I can't let you out of my life now.I couldn't live without you.You'd better go back to your bed.I'm sorry.Did you mean that? Would you really go?All I'm asking is enough gas
to get me to New York.That bag's worth $25.I got a bag. I got one for Christmas--Here's what I'll do.
I'll come back in the morning......and buy it back from you
with a $10 profit.- What do you say?
- I ain't got a hat.- What?
- I ain't got a hat.Well, you got one now.
Come on, fill her up.Where you been all this time?
Everybody's been asking about you.Get me one drink.
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour.Sure, boss.Hello, Agnes.- Don't. He'll shoot you on sight.
- Haven't been shot at in days.- Get out of here! Get out!
- Now listen, Joe.Don't ""Joe"" me.All right, Joe. Listen.You know I've always liked you.Anytime I could help you,
ran across a good story......I came running to you with it.
I got one now.The wires were on the level.
The biggest scoop ever.- It's yours.
- About the Andrews kid?I've got it all written up, ready to go.
All I want is a $1,000.A $1,000? Get out of here before--Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.I need a $1,000 and I need it quick.
I'm in a jam.What's the $1,000 for?To tear down the walls of Jericho.Never mind. If I told you that......Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?- She'll marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.Would such a story
be worth $1,000 to you?- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am.- You?
- Yes.Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home.
Don't annoy me anymore.For heaven sakes!
Stop being an editor for a minute.We know each other.
You ought to know when I'm serious.This is on the level.
I met her on a bus from Miami.I've been with her every minute.
I'm in love with her.You gotta get me this money now, quick.
Minutes count.She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.I gotta get right back.
She doesn't even know I'm gone.A guy can't propose to a gal
without a cent in the world, can he?What a story. On her way
to join husband, Ellen Andrews--That's it.Let me see that a minute.Zeke!I told you, you couldn't trust him.
He's gone.Who?The fella who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car with him, too.We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia.Get up, don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.See that? They're gone.Looks like it, don't it? What's this?Ma! Here's the woman.- What's the matter?
- Where's your husband?- Husband?
- Yes, if he is your husband.- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.You got any money?- No.
- Then you'll have to git!Yeah. You'll have to git.Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.And listen, next time you better not come
back here. I run a respectable place.- Thanks, you saved my life.
- Okay. So long kid and good luck.Goodbye. You're beautiful.
All women are beautiful.For my dough, he's still the best
newspaper man in the business.Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn.Hold up the morning edition.Break down the front page.
We'll have a new layout.Send in a couple of rewrite men.
And Hank, listen. Don't do a thing.I've got a story that'll make your hair curl.
Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up
all the pictures on that Andrews kid.And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed.
I want a cartoon and I want it quick.Westley's in it.
He's waiting at the church......with tears on his face.
The bride didn't show up.Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.Everything exaggerated.
Snap into it. What is it?Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp asking him to come.He's getting a police escort
and Westley's going along.Yes, she's been travelling by bus.When she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.Okay, grab a car and stay with them.
Get Hank again.Agnes, get me a doctor,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare.Agnes, you call the police department.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched.You want us?Change the front page!
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.She's going home. She found
out Dad withdrew his objections.She gave herself up.
Spread it all over the place!Play it up big! Major league!
""Love Triumphant."" Go on, hop to it.Okay.Come on, baby.
We gotta get there before she wakes up.Can't you drive any faster?""Young people in love are never hungry""Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.Come on, baby.
They can't make a sucker out of us.All right, come on.
Step back. Give them room.Come on, step back.How about a picture for the paper,
Mr. Andrews?Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.""He floats through the air
with the greatest of ease""The daring young man
on the flying trapeze""Get that thing out of the way!Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.Hey, you darn fool!Ellen Andrews is going to marry
that Westley guy again.Gordon's out back some place.When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter was just in.- What?
- He left this money.- He said he was just kidding.
- Where is he?- There he goes.
- Hey, Pete!Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.Yeah, sure you had me going
for a little while, too.- It wouldn't have made a bad story at that.
- No, great.But that's the way things go.
You think you've got a great yarn......and then something comes along and
messes up the finish. And there you are.Yeah. Where am I?When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.Thanks.Ellie?Hello, Dad.I knocked several times.I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.Everything's set.
Creating quite a furore, too.Great stunt King is going to pull.Stunt?Yeah, he's landing on the lawn
in an autogyro.Yes, I heard.Personally, I think it's silly, too.You look lovely, child.Are you pleased with the gown?Ellie?The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?What's the matter, child?What's wrong?Nothing.You haven't changed your mind
about King have you?No.Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.Well, you gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.You know,
the old pump isn't what it used to be.I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world. You know that.What's the matter, child?Aren't you happy?I thought so.I knew there was something on your mind.There, now.What's the matter?You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?Have you?I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.This must be serious.Where'd you meet him?On the road.Now don't tell me you've fallen in love
with a bus driver?Oh, no.Who is he?I don't know very much about him.Except that I love him.If it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth to--No, it's no use. He despises me.Come now.Yes, he does.
He despises everything about me.He says that I'm spoiled and selfish
and pampered and thoroughly insincere.Ridiculous.He doesn't think so much of you, either.Well, I--And he blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.He says you raised me stupidly.And now that's a fine man
to fall in love with.He's marvellous.What are we going to do about it?
Where is he?- I don't know.
- I'd like to have a talk with him.It wouldn't do any good.
I practically threw myself at him.Under the circumstances, don't you think
we'd better call this thing off?No, I'll go through with it.But that's silly.
Seeing the way you feel about him.No, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to stir up any more trouble.I've done it all my life.I've made your life miserable.
And mine, too.I'm tired, father. I'm tired
of running around in circles.He's right, that's what I've been doing
ever since I can remember.I've got to settle down.It doesn't matter how,
where, or with whom.You've changed, Ellie.I can't walk out on King now.
It would make us all look so ridiculous.Anyway, what difference does it make?I'll never see Peter again.Is that his name?Peter Warne.Peter Warne.Why, do you know him?Why, no.Father, you haven't heard from him,
have you?- Don't be silly, of course.
- Please, what's that?I guess that was his only interest in me,
wasn't it?- The reward.
- I'm sorry you read it.- Are you going to see him?
- I suppose so.Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.Mr. Westley's on his way up.Fine, have him come in.I'll be going.If it isn't the bridegroom himself.
You're just in time, King.How are you, Ellie?You happy?Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?Here we are, let's drink.It's up to you now.
I want our life to be full of excitement.We'll never let up, will we?
Never a dull moment.We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.Yeah. Who?Why can't I see you at your office?I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.I thought, perhaps,
you'd like to get this thing settled.Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.No. Why do I wanna--Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.I'd like to get a load of
that three ring circus you're pulling.I wanna see what love looks like
when it's triumphant.I haven't had a good laugh in a week.Mr. Warne?Yeah.- Sit down.
- Thanks.I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me anything......about you. About your helping her.That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.Why did she think
I lugged her from Miami?She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.She does? Isn't that sweet of her?
You don't, I suppose.Well, I don't know. I'll have to see
on what you base your claim.I presume you feel justified.If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemised.""Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $15.""Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.""Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.""All of the above items had
to be sold to buy gasoline.""And I sold some shorts and socks, too.
I'm throwing those in.- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000,
maybe more.Now, let me get this straight. You want
$39.60 in addition to the $10,000?What 10,000?The reward.Who said anything about a reward?I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.
I assumed--All I want is $39.60. If you give
me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.It gives me the jitters.- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.The average man would go
after the reward.Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?It's a matter of principle.
You probably wouldn't understand.When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like paying for the privilege.Were you taken for a buggy ride?Yes. With all the trimmings.
So how about the check, do I get it?- Certainly.
- Thanks.Here you are.Thank you.Do you mind if I ask you a question,
frankly?Do you love my daughter?Any guy in love with your daughter
should be examined.Now that's an evasion.She picked herself a perfect running mate,
King Westley. The pill of the century.She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.If you were wiser,
you'd have done it yourself long ago.Do you love her?A normal man couldn't live
with her without going nutty.She's my idea of nothing.I asked you a simple question!
Do you love her?Yes! Now don't hold that against me!
I'm a little screwy myself!Here's to the merry-go-round.Perfect. Now you look natural.- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.I would, but I've got a weak stomach.- I just had a long talk with him.
- I'm not interested.Now just a minute, Ellie.I don't want to hear
another word about him.Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.Here they come, boys. Turn them over.You're a sucker to go through with this.That guy, Warne, is okay.He didn't want the reward.
All he asked for was $39.60.It's what he spent on you.
Said it was a matter of principle.You took him for a ride.He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.I can buy him off for a pot of gold.And you can make an old man happy.And you won't do so bad for yourself.If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God......and in the face of this company,
to join together this man and this woman......in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully......be joined together, let him now speak
or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.King, will thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife so long as you both shall live?I will.Ellen, will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband......so long as you both shall live?Ellen!Ellie!What happened?I haven't the slightest idea.Don't want to talk to you.
Don't want to talk to anybody.Don't want to see anybody.But it's King Westley on the phone.Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law.
I've sent you a check for $100,000.That's the smartest thing you ever did,
Westley, not to contest that annulment.That's satisfactory, isn't it? It ought to be.I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. It was dirt-cheap.Don't fall out of any windows!There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.""What's holding up the annulment,
you slowpoke.""The walls of Jericho are toppling.""Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, ""Let them topple.""- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.If you ask me,
I don't believe they're married.They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.They made me get them a rope
and a blanket, on a night like this.What do you reckon that's for?Blamed if I know.
I just brought them a trumpet.A trumpet?A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.What in the world do they want
a trumpet for?Don't know."

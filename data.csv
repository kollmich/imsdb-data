He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit.     Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say     ""confident executive traveler."" The suit's custom-made but not     domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be     difficult to describe his identifying specifics...grey suit,        *     white shirt, medium height. And that's the idea...                  *     CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT     OVER his left shoulder, walking through milling travelers           *     towards the distant wall of metal and glass, sunlight streaming     at him...     ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN     - suit, blonde crew cut - walks to camera. Same sunlight, but     it hits him from the side. His trajectory is from the left.     His eyeline is slightly right. Just now, he looks down at a     ticket in his hand...     OVER VINCENT'S LEFT SHOULDER...     right now something catches Vincent's eye.   And the two men bump     into each other...     TWO-SHOT...                            VINCENT                You okay?    Sorry...     Vincent puts down his briefcase.   The man has a similar     briefcase.                          MAN                    (North London working-                     class accent)                Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, mate.   Enjoy                      *                LA...     VINCENT GRABS THE BRIEFCASE OF THE MAN     with the North London working-class accent. And continues     towards the exit. Was it an accident? Was it a brush pass?     The Man's accent signified nothing to us except one thing:     foreign origin.     VINCENT     approaches until he's in ECU...

RAP MUSIC BLARES from the radio.      Max    turns it off.    He dumps a CD into the changer. MOZART SONATA fills the cab.    From the open briefcase, Max also pulls out one last thing...    A TATTERED POSTCARD    which depicts the whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.    A dream place. An endorphin-releasing groove. Limitless    horizon. It's the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean.    MAX    slips the postcard under the rubber bands on the visor. He can    see it whenever he wants to. But not now.

Vincent's got the     tablet PC from his briefcase, studying it. The silence is     thick.     Max's hand is shaking. He lifts it off the wheel, tries to     steady his fingers.

From the other side of the cab, COP #2 lets out a laugh. He's     playing his flashlight beam across the seats. Mustard and mayo     everywhere.                          COP #2                Wha'd you, have a food fight in here?     Max gives Vincent an ""I told you so"" look in the rearview     mirror. Meanwhile, we HEAR dimly on the POLICE RADIO about a     domestic disturbance on 83rd and Hoover and some officers     responding.

White Guy #1 pulls Max's wallet, pockets it...      ...and pauses, seeing Vincent's briefcase on the back seat.      He yanks open the back door, grabs Vincent's briefcase, too, and      walks off after his friends. White Guys #3 and #4 turned the      corner. White Guy #2 lingers.      Max, still taped, is shaken.

HAMMERS-ON TWO ROUNDS to the      sternum, pivots. ONE to the head of #2. All in 1.6 seconds.      White Guy #2, falling backwards, is dead before he hits the      ground. #1 never saw it coming.

Frozen in horror.   Astonished.      The rear door opens. Vincent hefts his briefcase into the back      seat. He gets into the front.      Vincent sits for a moment, staring off, not looking at Max.      Maybe ready to kill him.      Vincent raises something into view.    Max's wallet.     He tosses it      in Max's lap.      Vincent flicks his hand. CLICK-CLACK, a Reeves folding hunter      in dull metal, razor sharp...                           VINCENT                     (quietly)                 Where's the button?

After his last               set, he decides to come on down to               South Central to hang with his people.               That's how he was, you see. Never               forgot who we was. Money and fame an'               all that? Meant nothin', long as he               could blow that horn.

VINCENT                Was it great? Better than great, it                had to be...                          DANIEL                Like Winton Marsalis says, it was                pure, spiritual essence. Louis was                playing. God was smiling.                          VINCENT                You heard Armstrong play live. I've                never been this jealous. You get to                talk to him?                          DANIEL                Did better'n that.     Vincent gives him a questioning look.     Daniel smiles, raises his     hands, mimes blowing a trumpet.

But do you know who they like                even better than Santa Claus? His                helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter.                There's an old Mexican tale that tells                of how Santa Claus got so very busy                looking out for the good children that                he had to hire some help to look out                for the bad children. So he hired                Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a                list with all the names of all the bad                children, and Pedro would come every                night to check them out. And the                people, the little kids that were                misbehaving, that were not saying                        *                their prayers, Pedro would leave a                little wooden donkey on their windows.                And he would come back and if the                children were still misbehaving, he                would take them away and nobody would                ever see them again. Now, if I am                Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do                you think jolly old Santa Claus would                feel if one day Pedro came into his                office and said, 'I lost the list.'?

Max and Annie desperately looking for cover. City racing by.       Train racing by city. A few RAGGED PASSENGERS trying to huddle       out of harm's way with nowhere to go. As the TRAIN THUNDERS AND       SHRIEKS over the track junctures...       THE FIRST CAR       Max and Annie rush in, slide the door shut. This is as far as       they can go. They drop into a crouch at the door, breathing       hard, terrified, Max with his back against the wall, arm stiffly       keeping the door handle wedged tight, his head just below the       door's window. A harsh, ragged whisper:                            ANNIE                  Where's the next station?       A frozen moment. Eyes locked. Knowing they're probably going       to die together, even though they hardly know each other.       THE TRAIN GOES BLACK, LIGHTS DYING AS THEY SHRIEK OVER ANOTHER       JUNCTURE...then the LIGHTS RETURN, stuttering.       Max rises slightly up, peers over the lip of the window. Here       comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees       Max. He shouts, barely audible from here...                            VINCENT                  YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX!   I DO THIS FOR A                  LIVING!       ...and he keeps coming, .45 at his side, a sheet of blood down       his face from the missing part of his ear.       ...the visage of Vincent, the .45 in his hands, scares the shit       out of the early-morning passengers.       ...and Max clutches the H+K, takes a deep, shaky breath, his       eyes on Annie's, not even sure in that moment what he's going to       do, probably die, and he lunges up, Vincent not ten feet away...       AND THE TRAIN GOES DARK.

He stares at       the H+K in his shaking hand, sees the slide is locked back -       gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, ""go ahead, kill       me..."" through the shattered window.       Vincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him.       Watching Max. A little smile on his face.107    INT. VINCENT'S CAR - NIGHT                                   107       Vincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the       floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the       weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot       Peter Yip the first time.       Odd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His       brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in       fact.       The magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among       the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter       quietly.       Vincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like       way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if       confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back       of the car.       The .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor.       Max watches Vincent walk away.       Vincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an       aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his       breath.       Max slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars.       Slides the second door open. Enters.       Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously       nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the       floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.       Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across       from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them.       VINCENT + MAX       sit there, riding the train.   Softly:                            MAX                  We're almost at the next station.

He leans his head toward Max as if       conferring a secret. In a halting whisper:                              VINCENT                    Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies.                        (off Max's look)                    Think anybody'll notice?       MAX       looks into Vincent's eyes. It means ""I'm that guy"" and ""will       anybody notice me when I'm gone?""       VINCENT       leans back, gazing straight ahead now.   Rocking gently with the       motion of the train...       ...and with much effort and to Max's amazement, Vincent emits a       soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same.       Max has no idea what's so funny to a dying man.    Vincent looks.       Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all       the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:       AN AD       The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.   A dream place.

It's a       small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She       takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the       train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now.       The train pulls in to a station...       WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR       ...and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open. They       silently get off.

Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and     cannot be removed.     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not     kill it on the ship.     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose     on the ship.     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's     bizarre life cycle.     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

Readouts and digital     displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future.     Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic     machinery chuckles softly to itself.     Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken.     Circuits close, lights blink on.     CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the     machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal:     INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT     A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with     instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid.     Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER     COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers.     FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the     freezers pop open.     Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.                              ROBY               Oh...

Fire up all systems.     They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles.  The control     room starts to come to life.  All around the room, colored lights     flicker and chase each other across glowing screens.  The room fills     with the hum and chatter of machinery.                              STANDARD               Sandy, you want to give us some               vision?                              MELKONIS               Feast your eyes.     Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches.  The     strip of viewscreens flickers into life.     On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.                              BROUSSARD                    (after a pause)               Where's Irth?                              STANDARD               Sandy, scan the whole sky.     Melkonis hits buttons.  On the screens the images all begin to pan.     CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a     starfield.     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE     CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.  This camera is remote controlled,     turning silently on its base.     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted on     the HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT.     When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP     ""SNARK,"" hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a     background of glimmering stars.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE                              ROBY               Where are we?                              STANDARD               Sandy, contact traffic control.     Melkonis switches on his radio unit.                              MELKONIS               This is deep space commercial vessel               SNARK, registration number E180246,               calling Antarctica air traffic               control.  Do you read me?  Over.     There is only the HISS OF STATIC.                              BROUSSARD                    (staring at a screen)               I don't recognize that constellation.                              STANDARD               Dell, plot our location.     Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his     instruments.                              BROUSSARD               I got it.  Oh boy.

We               haven't even reached the outer rim               yet.                              ROBY               What the hell?     Standard picks up a microphone.                              STANDARD               This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we               are not home.  Our present location               seems to be only halfway to Irth.               Remain at your posts and stand by.               That is all.                              ROBY               Chaz, I've got something here on my               security alert.

ROBY                    (punches buttons)               Computer, you have signalled a               priority three message.  What is the               message?                              COMPUTER                    (a mechanical voice)               I have interrupted the course of the               voyage.                              ROBY               What?  Why?                              COMPUTER               I am programmed to do so if certain               conditions arise.                              STANDARD               Computer, this is Captain Standard.               What conditions are you talking               about?                              COMPUTER               I have intercepted a transmission of               unknown origin.                              STANDARD               A transmission?                              COMPUTER               A voice transmission.                              MELKONIS               Out here?     The men exchange glances.                              COMPUTER               I have recorded the transmission.                              STANDARD               Play it for us, please.     Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A     STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN     LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls     silent.     The men all stare at each other in amazement.                              STANDARD               Computer, what language was that?                              COMPUTER               Unknown.                              ROBY               Unknown!  What do you mean?                              COMPUTER               It is none of the 678 dialects               spoken by technological man.     There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.                              STANDARD                    (silencing them)               Just hold it, hold it!                    (glares around the room)               Computer: have you attempted to               analyze the transmission?                              COMPUTER               Yes.  There are two points of salient               interest.  Number one: it is highly               systematized, indicating intelligent               origin.  Number two: certain sounds               are inconsistent with the human               palate.                              ROBY               Oh my God.                              STANDARD               Well, it's finally happened.                              MELKONIS               First contact...                               STANDARD               Sandy, can you home in on that beam?                              MELKONIS               What's the frequency?                              STANDARD               Computer, what's the frequency of               the transmission?                              COMPUTER               65330 dash 99.     Melkonis punches buttons.                              MELKONIS               I've got it.  It's coming from               ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds,               declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.                              STANDARD               Dell -- show me that on a screen.                              BROUSSARD               I'll give it to you on number four.     Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a     small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)               That's it.  Let me straighten it out.     He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in     the center.                              STANDARD               Can you get it a little closer?                              BROUSSARD               That's what I'm going to do.     He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)               Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers.                              MELKONIS               It's tiny!                              STANDARD               Any rotation?                              BROUSSARD               Yeah.  Two hours.                              STANDARD               Gravity?                              BROUSSARD               Point eight six.  We can walk on it.     Standard rises.                              STANDARD               Martin, get the others up to the               lounge.     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM     The entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and     FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.                              MELKONIS               If it's an S.O.S., we're morally               obligated to investigate.                              BROUSSARD               Right.                              HUNTER               I don't know.  Seems to me we came on               this trip to make some credit, not               to go off on some kind of side trip.                              BROUSSARD                    (excited)               Forget the credit; what we have here               is a chance to be the first men to               contact a nonhuman intelligence.                              ROBY               If there is some kind of alien               intelligence down on that planetoid,               it'd be a serious mistake for us to               blunder in unequipped.                              BROUSSARD               Hell, we're equipped --                              ROBY               Hell, no!  We don't know what's down               there on that piece of rock!  It               might be dangerous!  What we should               do is get on the radio to the               exploration authorities... and let               them deal with it.                              STANDARD               Except it will take 75 years to get               a reply back.  Don't forget how far               we are from the Colonies, Martin.                              BROUSSARD               There are no commercial lanes out               here.  Face it, we're out of range.                              MELKONIS               Men have waited centuries to contact               another form of intelligent life in               the universe.  This is an opportunity               which may never come again.                              ROBY               Look --                              STANDARD               You're overruled, Martin.  Gentlemen               -- let's go.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     The men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.                              STANDARD               Dell, I want greater magnification.               More surface detail.  I want to see               what this place looks like.                              BROUSSARD               I'll see what I can do.     He jabs his controls.  The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD THE     PLANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.                              STANDARD               It's out of focus.                              ROBY               No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud               layer.                              MELKONIS               My God, it's stormy for a piece of               rock that size!                              ROBY               Just a second.                    (punches buttons)               Those aren't water vapor clouds;               they have no moisture content.                              STANDARD               Put ship in atmospheric mode.     EXTERIOR - ""SNARK"" - OUTER SPACE     The great dish antenna on the SNARK folds down against the main body     of the ship, and other parts flatten out, until the ship has assumed     an aerodynamic form.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE                              STANDARD               Dell, set a course and bring us in               on that beam.     EXTERIOR - SPACE     The SNARK's engines cough into life, and send it drifting toward the     distant dot that is the planetoid.     CAMERA APPROACHES THE PLANETOID, until it looms large on screen.  It is     turbulent, completely enveloped in dun-colored clouds.     The SNARK drops down toward the surface.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE                              STANDARD               Activate lifter quads.                              BROUSSARD               Activated.  Vertical drop checked.               Correcting course.  On tangential               course now, orbiting.                    (brief pause as he                     studies his instruments)               Crossing the terminator.  Entering               night side.     EXTERIOR - ""SNARK"" - IN ORBIT     Beneath the orbiting SNARK, night's curtain rolls across the planet.     Descending at an angle, the SNARK drops down into the thick atmosphere     of the planetoid.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE                              ROBY               Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.                              STANDARD               Turn on navigation lights.     EXTERIOR - ""SNARK""     Hydroplaning down through the pea-soup atmosphere, a set of brilliant     lights switches on, cutting through the dust, but hardly improving     visibility.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE                              BROUSSARD               Approaching point of origin.  Closing               at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing.               Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are               directly above the source of the               transmission.                              STANDARD               What's the terrain down there?                              BROUSSARD               Well, line of sight is impossible               due to dust.  Radar gives me noise.               Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared --               noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There.               Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.                              STANDARD               Is it solid?                              BROUSSARD               It's... basalt.  Rock.                              STANDARD               Then take her down.                              BROUSSARD               Drop begins... now!  Fifteen               kilometers and dropping... twelve...                ten... eight and slowing.  Five.               Three.  Two.  One kilometer and               slowing.  Lock tractor beams.     There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders.                              ROBY               Locked.                              BROUSSARD               Kill drive engines.     The engines fall silent.                              ROBY               Engines off.                              BROUSSARD               Nine hundred meters and dropping.               800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT     The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers     above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.     Landing struts unfold like insect legs.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE                              BROUSSARD               And we're... down.     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT     The ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     The whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the     panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT.                              BROUSSARD               Jesus Christ!     The lights come back on again.                              STANDARD               What the hell happened?                              ROBY                    (hits a switch)               Engine room, what happened?                              FAUST                    (over, filtered)               Just a minute, hold it, I'm               checking.                              ROBY               Has the hull been breached?                              BROUSSARD               Uh...                     (scans his gauges)               No, I don't see anything.  We've               still got pressure.     There is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then:                              FAUST                    (over, filtered)               Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are               clogged with dust.  We overheated and               burned out a whole cell.                              STANDARD                    (strikes his panel)               Damn it!  How long to fix?                              ROBY                    (into microphone)               How long to fix?                              FAUST                    (over, filtered)               Hard to say.                              ROBY               Well, get started.                              FAUST                    (over, filtered)               Right.  Talk to you.                              STANDARD               Let's take a look outside.  Turn the               screens back on.     Melkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black.                              BROUSSARD               Can't see a blessed thing.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT     Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute     darkness around it.     THE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING     LIGHTS.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT                              STANDARD               Kick on the floods.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT     A ring of FLOODLIGHTS on the ship come to life, pouring blinding light     out into the night.     They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and     clouds of blowing dust.  The wind shrieks.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT                              ROBY               Not much help.     Standard stares at the dark screens.                              STANDARD               Well, we can't go anywhere in this               darkness.  How long till dawn?                              MELKONIS                    (consults his instruments)               Well... this rock rotates every two               hours.  The sun should be coming up               in about 20 minutes.                              BROUSSARD               Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see               something then.                              ROBY               Or something will be able to see us.     They all look at him.                                                       DISSOLVE TO:     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT (MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE)     The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the     darkness and the storm.  MAIN THEME MUSIC BEGINS, EXTREMELY OMINOUS.     THE TITLE APPEARS:                              ALIEN     RUN TITLES.     Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES.  The     silhouette of the SNARK becomes visible, like some strange insect     crouching motionless on the barren plain.  The floods shut off.  Dense     clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and     reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.     END MAIN TITLES.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange     dust.     PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.  The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, and     Melkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffee     and staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust.                              ROBY               There could be a whole city out               there and we'd never see it.                              BROUSSARD               Not sitting on our butts in here,               that's for sure.                              STANDARD               Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any               response yet?                              MELKONIS                    (pulls off his earphones)               Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn               transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've               tried every frequency on the               spectrum.                              BROUSSARD               Are we just going to sit around and               wait for an invitation?     Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his console     and speaks into the mike.                              ROBY                    (into mike)               Hello, Faust!                              FAUST                    (over, filtered)               Yeah!                              ROBY               How's it coming on the engines?     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM     Faust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speaking     into a wall intercom.                              FAUST               I never saw anything as fine as this               dust... these cells are all pitted on               a microscopic level.  I have to               polish these things smooth again, so               it's going to take a while.  Okay?     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              ROBY               Yeah, okay.                    (puts down the mike)                              STANDARD               Sandy... how far are we from the               source of the transmission?                              MELKONIS               Source of transmission is to the               northeast... about 300 meters.                              ROBY               Close...                               BROUSSARD               Close enough to walk to!                              STANDARD               Martin, would you run me an               atmospheric?                              ROBY                    (punches buttons and                     consults his panels)               10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon...                and some trace elements.                              STANDARD               Nontoxic... but unbreathable.               Pressure?                              ROBY               Ten to the fourth dynes per square               centimeter.                              STANDARD               Good!  Moisture content?                              ROBY               Zero.  Dry as a bone.                              STANDARD               Any microorganisms?                              ROBY               Not a one.  It's dead.                              STANDARD               Anything else?                              ROBY               Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.                              STANDARD               Well, we won't need pressure suits,               but breathing masks are called for.               Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of               portable unit that we can use to               follow that transmission to its               source?                              MELKONIS               No problem.                              BROUSSARD               I volunteer for the exploration               party.                              STANDARD               I heard you.  You want to break out               the side arms?     INTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DAY     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock.  They all wear gloves,     boots, jackets, and pistols.     Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut,     sealing them into the lock.     They all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks.                              STANDARD                    (adjusting the radio on his                     mask)               I'm sending.  Do you hear me?                              BROUSSARD               Receiving.                              MELKONIS               Receiving.                              STANDARD               All right.  Now just remember: keep               away from those weapons unless I say               otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              ROBY               Read you, Chaz.     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY                              STANDARD               Open the outer door.     Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams     into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE     WIND OUTSIDE.     A mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it     hits the ground.     Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others.     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY     The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet.     Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock.     The men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at     their clothes.  Nothing can be seen.                              STANDARD               Which way, Sandy?     Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder.                              MELKONIS                    (pointing)               That way.                              STANDARD               You lead.     Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the     others.                              STANDARD               Okay, Martin.  We're on our way.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his     console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a     screen.                              ROBY               Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you               on my board.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Good.  I'm getting you clear too.               Let's just keep the line open.     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY     The three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and     shrieking wind.  With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements,     they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean.     Melkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction     finder.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Can't see more than three meters in               any direction out here.  We're               walking blind, on instruments.     They wade on, following Melkonis.  Abruptly he halts.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               What's wrong?                              MELKONIS               My signal's fading.     He studies the direction finder.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     Roby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios.                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)                    (over, filtered)               It's the dust, it's interfering...      His concentration is so great that he does NOT NOTICE HUNTER COMING UP     BEHIND HIM.                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)                    (over, filtered)               ... Hold it, I've got it again.  It's               over that way.     Standing DIRECTLY BEHIND ROBY, Hunter speaks.                              HUNTER               What's happening?     Startled out of his wits, Roby GASPS and whirls around to face Hunter.                              ROBY                    (startled silly)               Hell!     Hunter stares at Roby, whose momentary terror dissolves into     embarrassed anger.     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY     The three men push their way through the storm.  Melkonis stops again,     studies the direction finder.                              MELKONIS               It's close, real close.                              STANDARD               How far?                              MELKONIS               We should be almost on top of it.  I               just can't quite...      Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points.  The others stare     in the direction he is pointing.     REVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POINT-OF-VIEW     Through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out     some kind of HUGE SHAPE.     As we watch, the dust clears slightly, REVEALING A GROTESQUE SHIP     RISING FROM THE SHIP LIKE SOME GIGANTIC TOADSTOOL.  It is clearly of     non-human manufacture.     ANGLE ON THE MEN     They are struck dumb by the sight of the craft.  Finally, Standard     finds his voice.                              STANDARD               Martin, uh, we've found it.                              ROBY                    (sharply -- over, filtered)               Found what?                              STANDARD               It appears to be some sort of               spacecraft.  We're going to approach               it.     They start toward the alien ship.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (over, filtered)               There are no signs of life.  No               lights... no movement...      Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (over, filtered)               We're, uh, approaching the base.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF TOADSTOOL SHIP - DAY     A strangely shaped DOOR yawns open at the base of the ship.  Dust and     sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance.     With great caution, the men approach the entrance and group around it.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Appears to be a door hanging open,               the entrance is clogged with debris.                              BROUSSARD               Looks like a derelict.                              STANDARD               Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to               hold the conversation to a minimum               from here on.     INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DAY     The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness,     spewing dust.  In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless     shapes.     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the     doorway.  They switch on flashlight-like devices called ""DATASTICKS"",     and step in.           Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct     machinery.                              MELKONIS               Air lock?                              STANDARD               Who knows?                              BROUSSARD               Let's try and find the control room.     As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls,     ceiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.                              MELKONIS               Look at these holes.  This place               looks like Swiss cheese.     Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.                              BROUSSARD               This hole goes up several decks --               looks like somebody was firing a               military disintegrator in here.     They all peer up the hole into darkness.                              STANDARD               Climbing gear.     Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it.     He aims it up into the hole and fires.     The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There     is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.                              BROUSSARD               I'll go first.                              STANDARD               No, you'll follow me.     Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and     presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the     hole, using his feet for leverage where he can.     Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP     This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the     hole.     Standard stands with his flashlight/camera (""datastick"") tracing a     beam through the hanging dust.     Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own     light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole.     THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns     of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes.     Broussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it.     It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings.     Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is     empty.     Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have     illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON,     SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR.     They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS A     GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.                              MELKONIS               Holy Christ...      Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton     is seated.  He moves his light closer and peers at the panel.                              STANDARD               Look at this...      They approach.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Something has been scratched here...                into the veneer.  See?     Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a     sharp instrument, is a small triangle:           Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the     beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES.     Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.                              MELKONIS               LOOK OUT, IT MOVED!     Standard knocks his hand down.                              STANDARD               Keep away from that gun!     Standard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he     begins to move toward the far side of the room.     They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it.     There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back     and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Just machinery.                              BROUSSARD               But functioning.     Melkonis looks down at his direction finder.                              MELKONIS               That's where the transmission is               coming from.     He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a     hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones.                              BROUSSARD               A recording.  A damned automatic               recording.     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET     SINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK.  As we watch, the sunlight turns the color     of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its     wake.  The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly     combatting the darkness and the storm.     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM     The entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching     holographic pictures projected onto a screen.  These are photos taken     by their ""datasticks"" (flashlight/cameras).     Standard is commenting on the changing slides.                              STANDARD               ... This is the control room...      Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the     suited men standing against banks of machinery.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               ... Some details of the control               room...      The SKELETON appears on the screen.  The men react with mutters.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               ... This is the skeleton... another               view of the skeleton... the               transmitting device...      The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               ... This is a closeup of the triangle               we found scrawled on the console in               front of the skeleton...      Standard changes the slide.  The screen goes white.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               ... And that's it.     He turns off the projector and brings the lights up.                              HUNTER               Phenomenal.  Staggering.                              BROUSSARD               We've got to go back and take a lot               more pictures, holograph               everything.                              MELKONIS               And bring back as much physical               evidence as possible, too.  The rest               of the skeleton.  Some of the               machinery.  Written records, if there               are any.     Roby is slumped in his chair.  He has said nothing.                              STANDARD               Martin?                              ROBY               I agree.  This is the single most               important discovery in history.                              STANDARD               But?                              ROBY               What killed it?                              BROUSSARD               Hell, that thing's been dead for               years.  Maybe hundreds of years.  The               whole planet's dead.                              FAUST               The way I figure it, they landed               here for repairs or something, then               they couldn't take off again.  Maybe               the dust ruined their engines.  They               set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody               came.  So they died.                              ROBY               He died.                              FAUST               What?                              ROBY               Not they... he...      They all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod.  CAMERA MOVES     OVER TO REVEAL THE ALIEN SKULL SITTING ON A TABLE.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               ... There was only one skeleton.     There is a moment of silence.                              STANDARD               Jay... how's it coming on the               repairs?                              FAUST               Well... I'm going to have to blow the               engines out...                               STANDARD               And when will you be ready to do               that?                              FAUST               Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.                              STANDARD               Then why the hell are you sitting               around here?                              FAUST               Right.     The men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in     thought, staring at the skull.  Melkonis lingers in the room with him.                              MELKONIS               And there sits man's first contact               with intelligent life in the               universe.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT     ANGLE ON THE SHIP, its spotlights cutting into the gloom.     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM     A room throbbing with power, enormous pulsing engines capable of     releasing unimaginable energies.     Faust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the     engines, with spotlights on it.  He is wearing goggles and thin gloves.                              FAUST               You ready up there?     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT     Broussard and Melkonis are seated at their consoles, conversing with     Faust while they watch their instruments.                              BROUSSARD               Sure, we're ready.     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM                              FAUST               Okay.  I'm going to start the               extraction procedure now.     He pauses to wipe his brow.     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM     Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the     photographic slides on the screen.  He is clicking slowly through them.     He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it.     The alien's misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him.  He     picks it up, holds it up to the screen for comparison, and studies it.     Standard appears in the doorway.                              STANDARD               Alas, poor Yorick.     Roby STARTS, puts down the skull.  Standard sits at the table.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (nodding at the screen)               Find anything we missed?                              ROBY                    (shrugs)               I don't even know what I'm looking               for.                              STANDARD               Still worried?                              ROBY               Oh well... you know me.                              STANDARD               I've always respected your opinion,               Martin.  If something worries you, it               worries me.     Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY     DRAWN TRIANGLE ON THE ALIEN CONTROL PANEL.                              ROBY               What would you say that was supposed               to mean?                              STANDARD               Well... it's obviously intentional...                some kind of attempt at               communication... maybe it's a symbol               that means something to them...                               ROBY               But why draw it on the wall?     Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily.     He rises and goes to the coffee machine.                              ROBY (CONT'D)                    (picking a hair out of                     the coffeepot)               This ship is full of cat hair.                              STANDARD               Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as               the engine's fixed --     BEEP!  The communicator interrupts Standard.  He leans across and     presses the button.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               This is Chaz.                              BROUSSARD                    (over, filtered)               Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come               topside for a minute?                              STANDARD               What's up?                              BROUSSARD                    (over, filtered)               Well, the sun just came up again,               and it seems the wind's died down.               It's as clear as a bell outside.               There's something I think you ought               to see.                              STANDARD               I'm on my way.     He and Roby head for the door.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive.                              STANDARD               What is it?                              BROUSSARD               Take a look.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY     The dust no longer blows.  The day is crisp, clear, and silent.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              BROUSSARD               I was scanning the horizon to see               what I could pick up.  Look there, on               that screen.                              STANDARD               What is it, I can't --     BLIP!  Broussard enlarges the image.     The screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon.     They all stare at the image for a long moment.  The silhouette of the     PYRAMID IS INSTANTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE SCRAWLED TRIANGLE in the alien     ship.           Standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille.                              STANDARD               This is Chaz.  All hands topside.               Now.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER     ANGLE ON A VIEWSCREEN.  It shows the PYRAMID on the horizon.  CAMERA     PULLS BACK to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the     room.                              STANDARD               Doesn't seem much doubt about it,               does there?                              MELKONIS               That creature sure must have               considered it important... using his               last strength to draw it...                               BROUSSARD               Maybe they built it.                              FAUST               As what?                              BROUSSARD               A marker for buried instrumentation?                              HUNTER               Or a mass grave.                              BROUSSARD               Maybe the rest of the crew is in               there -- in some kind of suspended               animation, waiting to be rescued.                              MELKONIS               It wasn't necessarily built by them.     On the screens, a puff of DUST blows in front of the pyramid.                              ROBY               Here comes the dust again.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY     WITH A SHRIEK, THE DUST STORM RETURNS, completely obscuring the SNARK.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              STANDARD               Well, does anyone else agree with               Martin that we should not explore               it?     Everyone looks around the room, but no one volunteers.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Then the sooner we get moving, the               better.     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY     LONG SHOT OF THE STONE PYRAMID, dust blowing in front of it.  It is a     crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless,     tapering toward the top.     Standard, Broussard, and Melkonis, wearing the protective suits,     approach the pyramid.  As they draw near, it becomes clear that the     pyramid is roughly 50 feet tall.                              STANDARD               We can't make out any details or               features yet... but it's definitely               too regular for a natural               formation...      INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     Roby and Hunter are present.  They are listening to Standard's VOICE ON     THE RADIO.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (over, filtered)               ... There's one thing I can say for               sure though...      BUZZZZZ!  Standard's voice is DROWNED OUT BY STATIC.                              ROBY               Now what's wrong?                              HUNTER               I've completely lost their signal.                              ROBY               Can you get them back?                              HUNTER               I'm trying.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY     The three men come to the base of the massive structure.  Dust and sand     have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the     base.                              MELKONIS               This looks ancient.                              STANDARD               Can't tell -- these weather               conditions could erode anything,               fast.     They walk around the base.                              BROUSSARD               There's no entrance.                              MELKONIS               Maybe the entrance is buried.  Could               be under our feet.                              STANDARD               Maybe there is no entrance; the               thing may be solid.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              ROBY               Well, there ought to be some way we               can get through to them --     The INTERCOM BEEPS.  Faust's voice is heard.                              FAUST                    (over, filtered)               Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna               charge up the engines for a minute,               okay?                              ROBY               Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.     A LOUD, POWERFUL THROBBING BEGINS, drowning out all other sounds, as     the engines are tested.     A light on Roby's panel is FLASHING.  We can see that it is the     COMPUTER ALERT.     Irritably, Roby throws the switch.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               Yes!                              COMPUTER               I have a temporary sequence on the               monitor --                              ROBY               Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!     He puts an earphone to his ear and switches the computer's voice over.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               Go ahead!     There is a PAUSE while Roby listens to the computer.  His eyes widen.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               You mean... you've translated it?     Another PAUSE as he listens to the earphone.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               Well come on, come on!  What does it               say?     Another PAUSE.  Roby's face changes; he looks CHILLED TO THE BONE.  His     mouth works.     Abruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE.                              HUNTER                    (looking over at Roby)               What?  What was that?                              ROBY               The computer just translated the               goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S.               It was a warning.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY                              BROUSSARD               Maybe we can get in by the top.                              STANDARD               You want to try?                              BROUSSARD               Sure.     Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the     top of the pyramid.  It catches.  He clips himself to the wire.                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)               You guys just wait down here till I               say it's okay to come up.     Broussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side     of the pyramid.     OMINOUS ANGLES showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust     blowing, the wind shrieking.     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY     The peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair.  Broussard arrives at     the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones.                              BROUSSARD               There's a hole at the top.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY                              STANDARD               Can we come up?                              BROUSSARD                    (over, filtered)               No, it's too small, only room enough               for one person.                              STANDARD               Can you see anything in the hole?     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY     Broussard leans over and looks into the hole.  He sees only blackness.     Freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on     the ""flashlight"" function, and shines it down into the hole.                              BROUSSARD               I can see... partway down.  It just               goes down like a stovepipe.  Smooth               walls.  I can't see the bottom --               light won't reach.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     Faust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face.                              FAUST               Yes?  What is it?                              ROBY               Jay, we've got a problem.  I was               wondering if there was any way you               could shortcut the repairs and give               us immediate takeoff capability.                              FAUST                    (quickly)               Why, what's wrong?                              ROBY               The computer's translated the alien               signal, and it's kind of alarming.                              FAUST               What do you mean?                              ROBY               It couldn't translate the whole               thing, only three phrases.  I'll just               read it to you the way I got it:                    (reads from a strip of paper)               ""... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO               NOT LAND... ""                    (looks up at the others)               And that's all it could translate.     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY     Hanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from     his belt.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Dell, you want to come down, we can               figure out where to go from here.                              BROUSSARD               No, I want to go in.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY     Standard and Melkonis exchange a glance.                              STANDARD               Okay, Dell, but just for a               preliminary look-around.  Don't               unhook yourself from your cable.  And               be out in less than ten minutes.     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY                              BROUSSARD               Right.     Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He     unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end     of it to his chest unit.     He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by     the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole.                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)               Okay, I'm in the mouth of the               chimney now, and I'm starting down.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Take care.     Broussard activates the climbing unit and lowers himself down into the     hole.     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY     Bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel,     Broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the     depths.     The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in darkness.                              BROUSSARD               It's noticeably warmer in here.  Warm               air rising from below.     He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops,     pushing off each time with his feet.     He stops to catch his breath.  His breathing rasps loudly in his     helmet.     A little sunlight filters down from above.  Looking up, he can see the     mouth of the hole, a glowing spot of light.     Standard's voice comes over his earphones.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Are you okay in there?                              BROUSSARD                    (gasping for breath)               Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom               yet.  Definitely a column of warm air               rising; it keeps the shaft clear of               dust.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               What was that Dell, I lost you, do               you read me?                              BROUSSARD               Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't               talk now.     He kicks off and continues down, taking longer and longer hops as he     gains confidence.     Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the light on his     instruments.                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)               I'm way below ground level.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY                              STANDARD               What'd he say?                              MELKONIS               I couldn't make it out -- too much               interference.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     Roby and Hunter.                              HUNTER               I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area               around the pyramid is dead to               transmission.  I think we should go               after them.                              ROBY               No.                              HUNTER               What do you mean, no?                              ROBY               We're not going anywhere.                              HUNTER               But they don't know about the               translation!  They could be in danger               right now.                              ROBY               We can't spare the personnel.  We've               got minimum takeoff capability right               now.  That's why Chaz left us on               board.                              HUNTER               Why, you chickenshit bastard --                              ROBY               Just can that crap!  I'm in command               here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's               leaving this ship!     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY     Broussard resumes his downward climb.  SUDDENLY, HIS FEET LOSE THEIR     PURCHASE AS THE WALLS OF THE SHAFT DISAPPEAR.     The tunnel has reached its end.  Below him is an unfathomable,     cavernous space.                              BROUSSARD                    (huffing and puffing)               Tunnel's gone -- cave or something               below me -- feels like the tropics               in here; air is warm and humid...                     (consults his instruments)               ... high oxygen content, no dust,               it's completely breathable --     Puffing with exertion, he releases his purchase on the stone walls and     begins to lower himself on power.  Now he is dangling free in darkness,     spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds.     Finally, his feet hit bottom.  He grunts in surprise and almost loses     his balance.     INTERIOR - TOMB - DAY     Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of     sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above.  Around is     solid darkness.     He flashes his datastick around.  The beam reveals that he is in a     stone room.  STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls.  They have     a primitive, religious appearance.  Row after row of pictograms stretch     from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language.  Huge     religious symbols dominate one wall.     Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque     monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.                              BROUSSARD               It's unbelievable!  It's like some               kind of tomb... some primitive               religion!  Hey, is anybody there?  Do               you read me?  Standard!     Annoyed, Broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them     hanging around his neck.  He takes a deep breath of the wet air.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - LATE AFTERNOON     Standard and Melkonis are standing around nervously.                              STANDARD               If we don't hear from him soon, I               think we better go in after him.                              MELKONIS               Sun will be down in a minute.     INTERIOR - TOMB - LATE AFTERNOON     Face bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is     dominated by a large, broad pedestal.  On the pedestal are ROWS OF     LEATHERY URNS OR JARS, EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE BROUSSARD STUMBLED ACROSS     IN THE ALIEN SHIP -- EXCEPT THESE ARE ALL SEALED.     He walks around the urns, studying them.  They all have sealed lids.  He     shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it.     He lifts his mask radio to his lips.                              BROUSSARD               I don't know if you can hear me, but               the place is full of large bottles               or jars, just like the one we found               on the other ship -- except these               are all sealed.  Also they're soft to               the touch.     He peers more closely at the leathery object.                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)               Another funny thing -- I just put my               hand on it, and now there are these               raised areas appearing where my               fingertips were.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY     THE SUN DROPS BELOW THE HORIZON, throwing the landscape into gloom.     Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights.                              STANDARD               Let's go.     He attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up.     INTERIOR - TOMB - NIGHT     Broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the     wall.  They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters.     He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he     turns back to the ""urn"" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN     THE TOP OF IT.     He shines his light on the floor at the base of the ""urn.""  There lies     the ""lid"" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and     studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside     surface is spongy and irregular.     Then he turns the light to the now-open ""urn.""     He bends over the mouth of the ""urn"" shining the light in, AND WITH     SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES     ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD.     With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the     thing with his hands.           EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT     The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top,     lights bobbing in the darkness.                              STANDARD                    (puffing with exertion)               Here's his line.  We can haul him out               of there if we have to.                              MELKONIS               It'll yank him right off his feet if               he's not expecting it.  The line               could get tangled in something.                              STANDARD               But what can we do?  He's out of               radio contact.                              MELKONIS               Maybe we should just wait a few more               minutes.     Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole.                              STANDARD                    (making up his mind)               No, I told him to be out in ten               minutes.  It's been much longer.               Let's get him out of there.     Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the     tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which     Broussard's line dangles.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               The line's slack.  Christ, do you               think the idiot unhooked himself?     He switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the     line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the     motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               There, it caught!                              MELKONIS               Is it still coming up, or is it               hooked on something?                              STANDARD               No, it's coming.                              MELKONIS               Can you see anything?     Standard shines his light down into the hole.                              STANDARD               No, I can't see far enough.  The               line's moving, though.     For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid,     saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls.     Then Standard shines his light back down in.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               I can see him!  Here he comes!     The winch begins to LABOR HEAVILY.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Get ready to grab him!     Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the     wire.  Standard reaches for him -- then RECOILS SHARPLY.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Look out!  There's something on               his face!     Melkonis attempts to come to his aid.                              MELKONIS               What is it?                              STANDARD               Don't touch him, watch it!     In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally     regain their balance.  They shine their lights on Broussard.     He appears to be completely unconscious -- AND THE OCTOPUS THING IS     STILL WRAPPED AROUND HIS FACE, MOTIONLESS.                              MELKONIS               Oh God, oh God no.                              STANDARD               Help me -- I'm going to try to get               it off.     With his gloved hands, Standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to     pull it from Broussard's head.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               It won't come -- it's stuck.                              MELKONIS               What is it?                              STANDARD               How the hell should I know?  Come on,               give me a hand, let's get him out of               there!     The two men grapple with Broussard's limp body, lifting him from the     hole.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT     Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent.  There is a long moment     while nothing is said, then:                              HUNTER               I've got 'em!  They're back on my               screens!                              ROBY                    (leaps to his feet)               How many?                              HUNTER               Three blips!  They're coming this               way!     Roby grabs a microphone.                              ROBY                    (into mike)               Hey, can you guys hear me?                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming               back!                              ROBY               Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen,               there's been a new development --                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Can't talk now; Broussard's injured.               We'll need some help getting him               into the ship.     Roby collapses into a chair, suddenly limp with apprehension.  He's     feared something like this all along, and now it has begun to happen.                              ROBY                    (to himself)               Oh no.                              HUNTER                    (into intercom)               Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the               main air lock!     Hunter dashes from the room.     Roby remains where he is, seated at his console.  He is stunned, his     mind racing.  CAMERA MOVES IN ON HIS FACE.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT     Hunter comes racing down the steps and hurries up to the inner lock     door.     He presses the wall intercom.                              HUNTER                    (into intercom)               Martin, I'm by the inner lock door!               I'll wait here for you to let them               in!     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT                              ROBY                    (strangely quiet)               Right.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT     Faust comes running up, covered with grime.                              FAUST               What the hell's going on?                              HUNTER               Don't know -- Broussard got hurt               somehow.                              FAUST               Hurt!  How?                              HUNTER               Don't know -- maybe we'll be real               lucky and he just broke his neck.                    (a beat)               I knew we shouldn't of come down               here.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT     Roby is seated alone in the room, listening to the transmission from     Standard and Melkonis.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Martin, are you there?     Roby leans forward and speaks into the microphone.                              ROBY               Here, Chaz.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               We're coming up now, open the outer               lock door.                              ROBY               Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               It's some kind of organism, it's               attached itself to him.  Let us in.     Roby does not reply.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (over, filtered)               You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer               door.                              ROBY               Chaz, if it's an organism, and we               let it in, the ship will be               infected.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               We can't leave him out here, open               the door.                              ROBY                    (urgently)               Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken               every rule of quarantine.  If we               bring an organism on board, we won't               have a single layer of defense left.                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Martin, this is an order!  Open the               door!     Hating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT     A RED LIGHT goes on, on a console on the wall.  The whine of a large     servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic CLUNK.                              HUNTER               Outer door's open.     After a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another     CLUNK.  The outer door has closed again.  The red light goes off.     The inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through,     carrying the sagging body of Broussard.  A cloud of choking dust     follows them out of the lock.                              STANDARD                    (pulling off his mask)               You men stay clear, there's a               parasite on him.     Hunter and Faust RECOIL.                              HUNTER               Oh -- God -- oh --                              FAUST               Is it alive?                              STANDARD               I don't know but don't touch it.               Give us a hand here, let's get him               up to the Autodoc.     Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden.     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY     One of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the     medical room, carrying Broussard.     Revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with     machinery.  The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed,     which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.                              STANDARD               Help me, come on, let's get him up               here.     They slide the man onto the bunk.                              HUNTER               That thing, God almighty, didn't you               try to get it off him?                              STANDARD               It wouldn't come.     Standard yanks off his gloves.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Medical gloves.     They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull     them on.     Gingerly, they approach Broussard.     Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing     on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to     pull it free.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               It's really on there tight.                              FAUST               Here, let me try.     Faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip     of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his     weight.                              STANDARD                    (grabbing Faust's hands)               Stop it, you're tearing his face.     A trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek.                              MELKONIS               It's not coming off -- not without               his whole face coming off too.                              STANDARD               Let's let the machine work on him.     Efficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a     couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard     is sucked into the slot in the wall.     He is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of     disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light.     A bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different     parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.     ROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.     Standard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard     each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE     FACE.     The others are shocked.                              HUNTER               Hey now, what is this?                              STANDARD               Ask him.                              ROBY                    (slowly puts his hand                     to his cheek)               I understand why you did that.                              STANDARD               Good.                              MELKONIS               He wouldn't open the lock; he was               going to leave us out there.                              HUNTER               Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I               mean, you brought the goddamn thing               in here.  Maybe you deserve to get               slapped.                              FAUST                    (embarrassed)               Excuse me, I've got work to do.     Faust exits.                              HUNTER               I keep my mouth pretty much shut,               but I don't like hitting.                              ROBY                    (to Standard)               I guess I had it coming.  Let's call               it settled.     After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns     his attention to the machinery.                              ROBY (CONT'D)                    (slowly)               Would somebody fill me in?                              STANDARD               He went into the pyramid alone.  We               lost radio contact with him.  When we               pulled him out, it was on his face.               It won't come off, not without               injuring him.                              HUNTER               Where did it come from?                              MELKONIS               He's the only one that knows that.                              HUNTER               How does he breathe?     They study the monitors.                              MELKONIS               Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.                              HUNTER               Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth               are blocked.                              STANDARD               Let's look inside his head.     Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray     image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER     TORSO.     The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the     creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is     that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open,     and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED     INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.                              ROBY               Look at that.                              HUNTER               What is it -- I can't tell               anything --                              ROBY               It's some kind of organ -- it's               inserted some kind of tube or               something down his throat.                              HUNTER                    (turning sick)               Oh... God...      Hunter bends over and RETCHES.                              ROBY               I think that's how it's getting               oxygen to him.                              HUNTER               It doesn't make any sense.  It               paralyzes him... puts him into a               coma... then keeps him alive.                              MELKONIS               We can't expect to understand a life               form like this.  We're out of our               back yard.  Things are different               here.                              HUNTER               Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we               can't leave the damn thing on him.                              MELKONIS               We don't know what might happen if               we tried to kill it.  At least right               now it's keeping him alive.                              HUNTER               How about cutting it off?  We can't               pull it loose, but we can cut off               everything but the bottom layer,               where it's stuck to his face.                              STANDARD               You're right... we can't stand here               and do nothing.     Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head.     Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch     and Broussard slides back out of the booth.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (muffled in his mask)               Somebody give me a scalpel.     Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall,     and carefully passes it to Standard.     Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his     hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button     with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum.     Standard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously.     Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and     holds it inconspicuously at his side.     Standard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to     the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the     back of Broussard's head.     Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue.     Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (muffled)               I've made an incision... it's not               reacting... but some kind of               yellowish fluid is leaking out of               the wound...      The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to     Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of     smoke curls up from the stain.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (muffled)               Hold it, this stuff's smoking!     The others REACT nervously.     By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has     dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble     and sizzle, and more smoke rises.     The men start to COUGH.                              MELKONIS               God, that smoke's poisonous!                              HUNTER                    (pointing)               It's eating a hole in the floor!     Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the     corridor outside, coughing their lungs out.     Standard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a     bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and     in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They     begin to smoke.     Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves.     Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY                              STANDARD               That stuff's eating right through               the metal!  It's going to eat through               the decks and right out through the               hull!     By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to     the level below.                              STANDARD               There!  Look!     A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and     drips to the floor.     It bubbles on the floor.                              MELKONIS               Jesus, what can we put under it?     Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below.     INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW     Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at     the ceiling.                              STANDARD                    (pointing)               There.  Should be coming through               about there.                              HUNTER               Careful, don't get under it!     INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE     Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid     sizzles.                              MELKONIS               Christ, that stinks.     Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the     floor.                              ROBY               Seems to have stopped penetrating.     Hunter comes charging up the steps.                              HUNTER               What's happening up here?                              ROBY               I think it's fizzled out.     Hunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the     pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by     the end.                              MELKONIS               I never saw anything like that in my               life... except molecular acid.                              HUNTER               But this thing uses it for blood.                              MELKONIS               Hell of a defense mechanism.  You               don't dare kill it.     Standard comes up the stairs.                              STANDARD               It's stopped?                              MELKONIS               Yes, thank heaven.                              STANDARD               We're just plain lucky.  That could               have gone right through the hull --               taken weeks to patch it.                              MELKONIS               Reminded me of when I was a kid and               the roof leaked -- everybody running               for the pots and pans.                              ROBY               My God, what about Broussard?     They turn and run up the stairs.     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY     They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen).     Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.                              ROBY               Did it get on him?     Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.                              STANDARD               No, thank God... just missed him.                              MELKONIS               Is it still dripping?                              STANDARD                    (examining it)               It appears to have healed itself.                              HUNTER               It makes me sick to see him like               that.                              MELKONIS               Isn't there some way we can get it               off him?                              STANDARD               I don't see how.  But let's do what               we can for him.     Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the     diagnostic coffin.  He presses more buttons, and the displays light up     again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               I think we'd better get some               intravenous feeding started.  God               knows what that thing is leaching               out of him.     Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade     Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.                              ROBY                    (studying the screens)               Look there, what's that stain on his               lungs?     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's     chest.  In the center, the stain is completely opaque.                              MELKONIS               It appears to be a heavy fluid of               some sort... it blocks the X-rays...                               ROBY               That tube must be depositing it in               him.                              MELKONIS               Could be some kind of venom, or               poison...                               HUNTER               This is horrible.                              ROBY               Hey!  what about the film?                              STANDARD               What film?                              ROBY               Broussard had film in his datastick,               didn't he?  We can see what happened               to him.     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM     Again we are watching slides in the darkened room.  This time Standard,     Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs     taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.     The camera reveals the ""urns.""  The climax of the sequence of stills     comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE ""URN"" TOWARD THE CAMERA --     and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to     show a series of meaningless blurs.  Then the reel ends.                              HUNTER               That must have been when he got it.                              ROBY               The same thing must've happened to               the creatures on the other ship...                except they took one of those jars               on board, and opened it there.                              MELKONIS                    (clicks back through the                     slides to a picture of                     one of the ""urns"")               At first I thought they were jars               too, or artifacts anyway.  But               they're not.  They're eggs, or spore               casings.  Let's go back to the               heiroglyphics.     CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a     blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of     heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.                              STANDARD               I personally can't make any sense               out of it...      CLICK.  CLICK.  Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing     different angles on the glyphs.                              MELKONIS               It's a crude symbolic language --               looks primitive.                              HUNTER               You can't tell -- that kind of stuff               could represent printed circuits...                               STANDARD               That sounds a little fanciful...                               MELKONIS               Primitive pictorial languages are               based on common objects in the               environment, and this can be used as               a starting point for translation...                               ROBY               What common objects?                              HUNTER               Listen, hadn't somebody better check               on Broussard?                              STANDARD                    (rising)               I'll do it.  The rest of you               continue.                              HUNTER                    (rising)               I'll come with you.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY     Standard and Hunter come down the passageway.                              STANDARD               You know, it's fantastic -- the               human race has gone this long               without ever encountering another               advanced life form, and now we run               into a veritable zoo.                              HUNTER               What do you mean?                              STANDARD               Well, those things out there aren't               the same, you know -- the spaceship               and the pyramid.  They're from               different cultures and different               races.  That ship just landed here --               crashed like we did.  The pyramid and               the thing from it are indigenous.                              HUNTER               How could anything be indigenous to               this asteroid?  It's dead.                              STANDARD               Maybe it wasn't always dead.     They arrive at the infirmary.     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY     The door slides open, and they step into the room.  Hunter activates     the bed, and it slides out of the wall.     THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.                              HUNTER               It's gone.     They rush to Broussard's prone form.  THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HIS     FACE.     Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing.  HIS FACE IS     COVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.                              HUNTER               Now we're in for it.                              STANDARD               The door was closed.  It must still               be in here.     They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the     door.  Standard grabs his arm.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               No, don't open the door.  We don't               want it escaping.                              HUNTER                    (very nervous)               Well, what the hell good can we do               in here?  We can't grab it -- it               might jump on us --                              STANDARD               Maybe we can catch it.     Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               As long as we're careful not to               damage it...      Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly     around the room.  There are very few places to hide.     He bends down and peers under the bunk.     As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE     THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.     He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO     THE FLOOR.                              STANDARD                    (leaping back)               Shit!     But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its     tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.     Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and     takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not     respond.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               I think it's dead.     With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite     into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid.     INTERIOR - LABORATORY     Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a     stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up.     Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.                              STANDARD               Look at these suckers -- no wonder               we couldn't get it off him.                              ROBY               Is that its mouth?                              MELKONIS               More likely that organ -- the tube-               like thing -- fits up in there.     With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy     aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.                              ROBY               Ugh.     Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.                              STANDARD               Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme               something to grab it with!     It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.     Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at     Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes     the thing in the tongs.     It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Christ!  Let's get it out of here!     Carrying the thing, he heads for the door.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing     in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK     They come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the     inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is     already on the intercom:                              ROBY                    (shouts into intercom)               For Chrissake, open the main lock!     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY     Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the     thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed     by the inevitable dust.     Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all.     EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY     The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust,     smouldering and fuming.     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY     The outer door rolls shut.                              ROBY                    (slumping against the                     wall)               My God, it's lethal even when it's               dead!     Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in     the floor.     Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor.  There,     he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK                              HUNTER                    (over intercom,                     filtered)               Yes?                              STANDARD               How's Broussard?                              HUNTER                    (over, filtered)               He's running a fever.                              STANDARD               Still unconscious?                              HUNTER                    (over, filtered)               Yes.                              STANDARD               Can you do anything for him?                              HUNTER                    (over, filtered)               The machine will bring his               temperature down.  His vital               functions are strong.                              STANDARD               Good.     He switches off the intercom.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (suddenly exhausted)               I need some coffee.     He turns and walks away.     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM     The cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats;     Standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.                              MELKONIS               These day and night cycles are               totally disorienting.  I feel like               we've been here for days, but it's               only been how long?                              ROBY                    (stroking the cat)               About four hours.                              STANDARD                    (staring into his coffee                     cup)               I'm sorry to say it looks like you               were right in the first place,               Martin.  We never should have landed               here.                              ROBY               Look, I'm not trying to rub               anybody's nose in anything.  The               important thing is just to get away               from here as fast as possible.                              STANDARD               I can't lean on Faust any harder --               he's been working non-stop on the               engines.                              ROBY               If we knew exactly what happened to               the beings on the other ship --                              MELKONIS               We do know that.                              ROBY               Yeah?                              MELKONIS               They never made it off the planet.               The parasites won.     This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.                              ROBY               Where did the parasites come from?                              STANDARD               They seem native to the planet.  It's               got an atmosphere and a dense               gravity.  It's dead now, but once it               must have been fertile.                              MELKONIS               No.  It's just too small to support               fauna as big as the parasites.  If               there were a native ecology, it               would have to be microscopic.                              ROBY               Couldn't the pyramid have been built               here by space travellers?                              STANDARD               Too primitive.  It's a pre-               technological construction.  That               slab was engineered by an Iron-Age               culture at best.                              MELKONIS               They're from a dead civilization;               they're spores from a tomb.  God               knows how long they've been here.                              ROBY               I think we better take another look               at those heiroglyphs.     Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in.  He is covered     with dirt and grime.                              FAUST               Hey, guess what?                              STANDARD               What?                              FAUST               The engines are fixed.     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY     The SNARK's engines cough and then with a ROAR BEGIN TO BELCH OUT     STREAMS OF SUPERHEATED AIR, cutting through the tulgy dust.     The ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimited     power.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     They are all at their posts.                              STANDARD               Switch on tractor beams.     There is a hair-tingling ELECTRICAL HUM which permeates the whole     ship, and it begins to float, like a cork in water.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Lock tractor beams.     The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Retract landing struts.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY     The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force.     The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              STANDARD               Take us up.                              ROBY                    (into intercom)               Up one kilometer, Jay.     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY     The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              STANDARD               Switch on lifter quads.     A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES.     EXTERIOR - ""SNARK"" - DAY     The hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking     atmosphere.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY                              STANDARD               Engage artificial gravity.     Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES.                              ROBY               Engaged.                              STANDARD               Let's take her into an escape orbit.     The men get busy with switches.                              ROBY               I'm altering our vector now; should               give us an easy escape velocity --     A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.                              ROBY & MELKONIS                    (in concert)               What was that?     In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.                              FAUST                    (over, filtered)               This dust is getting clogged in the               intakes again!                              STANDARD               Just hold us together till we're in               space, that's all!     The pitch of the engines changes, deepens.     EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY     The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds.     Visibility is zero.     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM     Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning     to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to     suck up some of the dust.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY     On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS     THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim,     set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically     they mutter technical instructions to each other.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY     Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT     INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE     They all CHEER.                              ROBY                    (pounds his panel)               We made it!  Damn, we made it!                              STANDARD               You bet we made it.  Martin, set               course for Irth and accelerate us               into stardrive.                              ROBY               With great pleasure.     Roby begins to punch buttons.                              MELKONIS               I feel like an escapee from Hell.                                                            DISSOLVE TO:     EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER     The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the     universe all around.     There is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching     the ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red.  This is     redshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE     They are unstrapping.                              ROBY               That's the part that always makes me               feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we               accelerate into light speed.                              STANDARD               Quit complaining; we're in space.     They rise and head out of the room.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR     As they walk along.                              STANDARD               I think the best thing to do with               Broussard is to just freeze him as               he is.  It'll arrest the progress of               his disease, and he can get complete               medical attention when we get back               to the Colonies.                              ROBY               We'll have to go into quarantine,               maybe for quite a while.                              STANDARD               That's okay, he can remain in               hypersleep until they're ready to               treat him.     They enter the infirmary.     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY     As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP     in BED -- AWAKE.                              BROUSSARD                    (hoarsely)               ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some               water...      Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water.  Broussard gulps it     down in a swallow.                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)               More.     Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard,     who greedily consumes the entire thing.  Then he sags, panting, on the     bunk.                              STANDARD                    (softly)               How do you feel, Dell?                              BROUSSARD                    (weakly)               Wretched.  What happened to me?                              STANDARD               Don't you remember?                              BROUSSARD               Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly               remember my name.                              ROBY               Are you in pain?                              BROUSSARD               Not exactly, just feel like               somebody's been beating me with               rubber hoses for about six years.     Melkonis laughs at this remark.  Broussard smiles faintly at him.                              STANDARD               Hell, you're in great shape, you've               got your sense of humor back!                              BROUSSARD               God I'm hungry.                              ROBY               Dell, what's the last thing you can               remember?                              BROUSSARD               ... I don't know...                               ROBY               Do you remember the pyramid?                              BROUSSARD               No.  Just some horrible dreams about               smothering.  Where are we?                              STANDARD               We're going home.  We're in               hyperspace.                              MELKONIS               We're going into the freezers now.                              BROUSSARD               I'm really starving; can we get some               food before we go into the freezers?                              STANDARD                    (laughs)               I think that's a pretty reasonable               request.     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM     The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions     greedily.  The cat eats from a dish on the table.                              HUNTER               Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a               straight shot back to the Colonies,               and then we can start taking bids on               the paydirt.  Any bets on the top               bid?                              FAUST                    (chewing)               Well, we should at least be able to               each buy our own planet.     They all CHUCKLE.                              MELKONIS               I'm going to write a book about this               expedition.  I'm going to call it               ""The Snark Log.""                              STANDARD                    (stiffly)               The commander normally has first               publication rights.                              MELKONIS               Maybe we could write it together.                              ROBY               First thing I'm going to do when we               get back is eat some biological               food.                              MELKONIS               What's the matter, you don't like               this stuff?                              ROBY               Tastes like something you'd feed a               chicken to make it lay more eggs.                              STANDARD               Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag               than this, but I've had worse too,               if you know what I mean.                              FAUST               I kind of like it.                              ROBY               You like this shit?                              FAUST               It grows on you.                              ROBY               You know what they make this stuff               out of?                              FAUST                    (annoyed)               Yes, I know what they make it out               of, so what?  It's food now.  You're               eating it.                              ROBY               I didn't say it was bad for you,               it's just kind of sickening, that's               all.                              HUNTER               Do we have to talk about this kind               of crap at the dinner table?     Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS.                              STANDARD               What's wrong?                              BROUSSARD                    (his voice straining)               I don't know... I'm getting these               CRAMPS!     The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips.     He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles     whitening.                              STANDARD               Breathe deeply.                              BROUSSARD                    (screaming)               OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD!                              ROBY               What Dell -- what?     Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is     trembling violently from head to foot.                              BROUSSARD                    (incoherent shriek)               OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!     A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.     THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS     TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A     MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.     Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and     bolts.     The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's     chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood     -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and     scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.     When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.     Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest,     spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with     blood and slime.                              HUNTER               Oh, no.  Oh, no.                              FAUST               What was that?  What the Christ was               that?                              MELKONIS               It was growing in him the whole time               and he didn't even know it!     Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse.                              ROBY               That thing used him for an               incubator!     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE     A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped     body tumbles silently out.     AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into     eternity.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS     The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge.                              MELKONIS               We can't go into hypersleep with               that thing running around loose.                              HUNTER               We'd be sitting ducks in the               freezers.                              ROBY               But we can't kill it.  If we kill it,               it will spill all its body acids               right through our hull and out into               space.                              FAUST               Shit...                               STANDARD               We'll have to catch it and eject it               from the ship.                              MELKONIS                    (sighs)               Well, I kind of hate to point it               out, but all our supplies are based               on us spending a strictly limited               amount of time out of suspended               animation... and as you know, we used               up most of that time in harvesting.                              STANDARD               We've got about a week left, right?                              HUNTER               And then we run out of food and               oxygen.                              FAUST               The water will still recycle.                              ROBY               We won't need it then.                              STANDARD               All right, so that's what we've got.               A week.  It's plenty of time.                              ROBY               But if we haven't caught it in a               week, then we have to go into the               freezers anyway.     They enter the bridge.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE                              STANDARD               So does anybody have any               suggestions?                              FAUST               We could put on our pressure suits               and blow all the air out of the               ship.  That would kill it.                              STANDARD               No, we can't afford to lose that               much oxygen.  We're going to have to               flush it out.                              MELKONIS               How?                              STANDARD               Room by room, corridor by corridor.     No one likes this thought.                              MELKONIS               And what do we do when we find it?                              STANDARD               We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we               had a really strong piece of net, we               could bag it.                              FAUST               We could cut a section out of that               metallite netting.  It won't hold up               to that acid, but aside from that               it's pretty strong.                              ROBY               We have to avoid injuring it.  What               we really need is some electric               animal prods.                              HUNTER               I think I could cobble something               together.  A long metal rod with a               battery in it.  Give it a hell of a               shock.                              STANDARD               Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm               issuing a standing order: from this               moment forth, every one of us will               wear protective garments, including               helmets.  Let's get down to the               locker and change.     They start for the exit.     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE     The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is     garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot     policeman, including clear plastic helmet.     He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different     gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical     wall.     He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside-     down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down     them.     INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE     Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space.     He also wears the protective suit.     Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie     here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels     provide the only illumination.                              STANDARD               I thought I'd find you here.                              MELKONIS               I was thinking of a line from an old               poem: ""Water, water everywhere, but               not a drop to drink.""  All that space               out there, and we're trapped in this               ship.                              STANDARD               That's the one about the albatross,               right?                              MELKONIS               We can't even radio for help; the               carrier wave wouldn't reach its               destination till long after we'd               died and turned to dust.  We are               utterly, absolutely alone.  Can               anybody really visualize such a               scale of distances?  Halfway across               Creation...                               STANDARD               We came out there, we'll go back.  A               long time by the clock, but a short               time to us.                              MELKONIS               Time and space have no meaning out               here.  We're living in Einsteinian               equation.                              STANDARD               I can see you're putting your spare               time to good use.                    (leans forward and taps                     him on the knee)               Let me tell you something: you keep               staring at hyperspace for long               enough, they'll be peeling you off a               wall.  I've seen it happen.                              MELKONIS                    (smiles at him)               We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We               even have our own special diseases.                              STANDARD               Come on -- let's go above and see               how they're coming with the gear.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     The whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of     shimmering metallic netting.     Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.                              HUNTER               These have portable generators in               them.  They're insulated down to here               -- just be careful not to touch the               end.     He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal     object.  A blue spark leaps.                              FAUST               Might even incinerate the damn               thing.                              STANDARD                    (sharply)               I hope not.                              HUNTER               Don't worry, it won't damage it,               it'll just give it a little               incentive.                              STANDARD               How do we locate the creature?                              FAUST               With these.     He picks up a small portable unit.                              FAUST (CONT'D)               Tracking device.  You set it to               search for a moving object... It               hasn't got much range, but when you               get within a certain distance, it               starts beeping.     Standard takes the device and studies it.                              STANDARD               These will be very useful.  At least               we won't have to go digging around               in closets with our bare hands.  All               right, here's the battle plan: we're               going to break into two teams and               start systematically covering the               ship.  Whoever finds it first,               catches it in the net and ejects it               from the nearest airlock.  Clear?                              ROBY               Even simple.     Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:                              STANDARD               For starters, let's make sure the               bridge is safe.     Faust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room.                              FAUST               It's clear.                              STANDARD               All right -- Roby and Melkonis will               go with Faust.  Hunter and I will               make up the second team.     They start doling out the equipment.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               We'll all carry communicators.  We               want to keep in constant touch.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Melkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it,     carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to     side.                              FAUST               Nothing yet... nothing... we can move               pretty fast as long as there's               nothing on the tracker.     INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS     Standard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a     double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS     Roby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:                              FAUST               Hold it.     Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.                              FAUST (CONT'D)               I've got something.     Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.                              ROBY               Where's it coming from?                              FAUST                    (peers closely at tracker                     and frowns)               Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.               Needle's spinning all over the dial.                              MELKONIS               Is it malfunctioning?     Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.                              FAUST               No, just confused.  It's coming from               below us.     They all look down at their feet.     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL     Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal     stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.     The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the     ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining.     They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading     the net across the corridor.                              ROBY               Okay.                              FAUST                    (looking at tracker and                     nodding down the passageway)               That way.     They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw     metal flooring.  It is extremely dark.                              ROBY               What happened to the lights?                              FAUST               Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to               replace 'em.     They switch on the helmet lights.     CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:                              FAUST (CONT'D)               Hold it.     They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.                              FAUST (CONT'D)                    (whispering)               It's within 4 meters.     Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust,     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of     approaching the source of the signal.     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one     wall.     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod     inside.     WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF     THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.     Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:                              ROBY                    (very annoyed)               Oh, hold it!     They open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and     spitting, it scampers away.                              MELKONIS               We're making fools of ourselves!     Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.                              ROBY                    (into communicator)               Yes!                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               We've got it up here!  It's trapped!               Get up here fast!                              ROBY               Where are you?                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Food-storage room!                              ROBY               We're coming!     They dash for the stairs.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Roby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive     at:     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOM     Standard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.                              HUNTER               We saw it inside and slammed the               door on it!  It's in there now!     On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.                              ROBY               What's it doing, having a seizure?                              STANDARD               It started crashing around right               after we locked it in.                              ROBY               Now what?                              STANDARD               I guess we open the door and net it.                              HUNTER               I hate to open that door.     Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.                              STANDARD               It looks completely different from               the first one -- it's more like a               worm with legs... and tentacles.                              FAUST               Well we better do something.                              HUNTER               Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped               in there.  We could just leave it in               there all the way back to Irth.                              STANDARD                    (snaps)               Don't be an idiot.                              FAUST               I know what we can do.  We can pump               poison gas into the room and kill               it.  Through those ventilator slots               there.     He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.                              ROBY               Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our               food supplies in there!  We can't               pump poison gas all over them!                              STANDARD               Once we kill the thing we won't need               the food any more -- we can go               straight into hypersleep.  Also, it               sounds like that thing is already               doing a pretty good job on our               supplies; it may be fouling them               all.                              ROBY               You win.                              FAUST               Somebody gimme a hand, I'll get the               stuff.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATER     CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel-     shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door.     This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large     metal tank with pressure gauges.                              STANDARD               Get those masks on.     They pull on gas masks.                              ROBY               This stuff's deadly -- I hope we               know what we're doing.                              STANDARD               Go ahead, Jay.     Faust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas     through the hose and into the room.     Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN     BE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING.     Then the sounds stop altogether.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Shut it off.     Faust shuts off the pump.                              ROBY               Now what?                              STANDARD               What do you think?  Now we go in.     Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows     out.     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM     The room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in     their gasmasks.     The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered     all over the floor.                              FAUST               Looks like he helped himself.     Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised.     Then Hunter points.                              HUNTER               God damn it.     They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL     HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.                              HUNTER (CONT'D)               It escaped.     They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.                              ROBY               Where does that go?                              FAUST               All over the ship; we'll have to               check the charts to know for sure.                              STANDARD               Then let's go and do it.     They head for the door.                              HUNTER               Have we got any food at all left in               the ship?     They slam the door shut and seal it.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of     ventilator shafts.                              FAUST               That one section of the ventilator               shaft has only two outlets -- you               notice?  The food storage room on one               end --                              HUNTER               -- And the cooling unit on the               other.                              STANDARD               So it's trapped in between -- now we               have to drive it out.                              FAUST               Poison gas...                               HUNTER               We can't pump poison gas down into               the cooling unit!  It'll flood the               whole ship!                              STANDARD               The only other thing I can think of               is for somebody to crawl in there               and flush it out.                              ROBY               Are you crazy?                              STANDARD               The man would need protection,               obviously -- as well as some way to               drive the thing before him.                              FAUST               How about a flamethrower?  That               wouldn't poison the air.                              MELKONIS               So one of us goes into the airshaft               and drives the thing along --                              STANDARD               While the rest of us wait down in               the cooling unit with the net.                              HUNTER               Sounds like a rough one.                              STANDARD               Got a better idea?     Hunter shrugs.                              ROBY               So the only question left is: who               gets to crawl down the airshaft?                              STANDARD               Let's be democratic.     He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one     of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a     tiny little ball.     He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table     like dice.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Martin, take one.     Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank.     Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank.     Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They     are both blank.     They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Open it up, Cleave.     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM     Hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower.  Faust is     helping him.     Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.                              FAUST               Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you               won't need me, but if you do, I'm               here.                              HUNTER                    (grimly)               Right.     Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just     large enough to crawl through.     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT     It is completely dark in the shaft.  Hunter reaches up and turns on his     helmet light.  Then he switches on his radio.                              HUNTER               Hey, do you guys read me down there?     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM     Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net.  We hear the hum     of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.  Large airshafts run     off in different directions.                              STANDARD               Yeah, we're getting into position.     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT                              HUNTER               Okay, I'm starting now.     He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel.  He turns a     corner.     After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.     Hunter twitches.  He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE     DARKNESS.  It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly     heats up.  Smoke drifts back into his face.  He begins to sweat.     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM     Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.                              ROBY                    (pointing)               There.  That's where it's got to come               out.     He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the     opening.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               That's a flip-flop gate to channel               the air, but we can use it to trap               the thing.                              STANDARD               Right now let's keep it closed.     Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it.  The     screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.                              MELKONIS               I've got Hunter... and something else               as well, in front of him.                              STANDARD               Are they close?                              MELKONIS               They're on the next level up.                              STANDARD               Let's get moving with this net.     They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT     Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees.  Up ahead, he can see that     the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.     He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his     flamethrower.     Then he starts crawling down, head first.     When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning     which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.     Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.     Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is     narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering.  He hears a HISSING CRY up     ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.     Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal     flaming burst toward the sound.     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM     Melkonis is staring at his screen.                              MELKONIS               They're getting pretty close now.                              STANDARD               All right, then -- when it gets to               the other side of the door, you sing               out, then drop the door.  Okay?                              MELKONIS               Okay.                              STANDARD                    (to Roby)               And you and I will bag it, and then               we'll take it to the ventral air               lock, got it?                              ROBY                    (tensely)               Uh-huh.     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT     Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the     flamethrower.                              HUNTER                    (whispers)               Hey, you guys.     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM                              STANDARD                    (into communicator)               Yes!     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT                              HUNTER                    (whispering)               I don't think this shaft goes on too               much farther... anyway it's getting               pretty hot in here...      INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM                              STANDARD                    (into communicator)               Okay, our screens show you as being               near to the opening.  We'll open it               up, then we'll cue you and you can               start blasting.  That'll drive it               right out.  You don't have to go any               farther.     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT                              HUNTER               Good.     He readies the flamethrower.     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM                              STANDARD               Okay, get ready.     He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch     the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric     prod.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               Open the vent, Sandy.     Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops     down, opening up the shaft.     A SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND     IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN     OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES.     Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in     one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN,     THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK.     CLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS     DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING     AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT.     Standard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter     climbs out of the shaft.                              HUNTER               What happened?  Where is it?     They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the     creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into     darkness.                              STANDARD                    (awed)               How did it get so big?                              ROBY               By eating our food supplies.                              HUNTER               Where's Melkonis?     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM     Faust is still waiting.                              FAUST                    (into his communicator)               Hey, are you guys still there?               What's going on?                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful --               it's huge now.                              FAUST               Right.     Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks     the door behind him.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS     Standard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge.                              HUNTER               You mean his body was still kicking               when it ran off with him?                              ROBY               It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a               chicken.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     Standard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows     shortly.  They all look blank, stunned.                              FAUST               What happened?  Where's Sandy?                              ROBY               Dead.                              FAUST               Dead!                              ROBY               It's monstrous -- it grew, like some               horrible tapeworm.  We were               completely unprepared.                              FAUST               It's still in the ship?                              STANDARD               We'd better seal off the lower               maintenance level; at least trap it               there.                    (throws a switch;                     circuitry lights up)                              HUNTER               At least it can't get up here now.                              ROBY               Two down, four to go.                              STANDARD                    (angrily)               What's that supposed to mean?                              ROBY               Nothing.                              HUNTER               Listen, it sure didn't like this               flamethrower.                              STANDARD               That's right -- we can't kill it on               the ship, but we can at least keep               it at bay -- and maybe drive it into               the air lock.                              HUNTER               Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.                              FAUST               There's some more combustible fuel               down in the storage lockers next to               the lounge.                    (rises)               I'll go get it.                              STANDARD               No, I don't want us separated.                              FAUST               You just sealed it off; it can't get               to that section.                              ROBY               Don't count on it.                              HUNTER               We sure need this flamethrower.                              STANDARD               All right... but do not go below               decks.                              FAUST               Right.                    (heads for the door)                              STANDARD               And be right back.	Faust exits.                              ROBY               I think it's time we took a hard               look at those heiroglyphs.     Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics     appear on some of the screens.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               Can you make out any pattern in all               that?                              STANDARD                    (baffled)               Well... yes... there's a pattern... but               it's meaningless to me.                              ROBY               I know it looks like a senseless               jumble, but if you look closely,               there are recognizable forms.                              HUNTER               Recognizable!  In that?                              ROBY               In symbolic form... very stylized...                but if you stare at it, you can see               some of the different creatures               we've been dealing with.                              HUNTER               Well... I suppose that star-shaped               thing could be the parasite that got               on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?                              ROBY               And right next to it, that oval               design with the markings -- it's a               dead ringer for the spore casings.                              STANDARD               That next thing there -- six legs,               tentacles -- that's the thing we saw               in the food locker.                              ROBY               So the next step should be --                              HUNTER               -- The big one.  And there it is.     Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible     to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.                              ROBY               This is all the same creature.  We're               seeing the different stages in its               life-cycle.                              STANDARD               Then that tomb... must have been some               kind of fertility temple... where               they stored their eggs, and maybe               held mating rituals...                               HUNTER               ... And Broussard got caught in their               reproductive cycle.                              ROBY               You will notice, though, that there               are no more phases.  Only four forms               are shown.  After that the pattern               repeats.                              STANDARD               Which presumably means...                               ROBY               ... More spores coming.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK     Faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt     halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEEN     WRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES.     He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THE     DIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN.     Faust hesitates and peers into the lock.     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK     The creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a     bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK     Stealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall     intercom and speaks into it.                              FAUST                    (whispering)               It's in the lock -- blow the main               lock.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     Standard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from     Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence.                              STANDARD                    (into intercom)               What?     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK                              FAUST                    (whispering)               It's in the main air lock.  Blow the               lock.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK     With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK     The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-     HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.     FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,     crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.     On the wall, a green light goes on:                         ""INNER DOOR CLOSED""     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK     Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.     IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE     In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into     the vacuum under pressure.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is     sucked out toward the lock.     A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:                         ""CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION""     After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control     room.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS     Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along     by the air current.     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE     A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS     Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,     HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.     Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running     again.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK     Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.     Done in, he collapses to the floor.     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking     underwater.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses     bleed.     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can     only hear distant croaks.     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others     follow him.     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.                              ROBY               How much oxygen did we lose?     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.                              STANDARD               We've got six hours left.                              HUNTER                    (groans)               Oh my God.                              STANDARD               Does anybody know what happened?                              ROBY               I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed               in the air lock door.  His body held               it open.                              STANDARD               Can we get to him?                              ROBY               No, I had to seal off a whole               section.  We'd lose too much of our               remaining air if we opened the               connecting door.     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK     Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the     vacuum.  His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.     The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.                              ROBY                    (picking up the cat)               Poor kitty; puss puss puss.                              STANDARD               At least we're rid of the damn               monster.  It must have been the first               thing sucked out of the ship.                              ROBY               No such luck.  I saw it running down               one of the corridors.                              HUNTER                    (groans)               Oh no!  We can't fight this thing!               There's only six hours of air left               -- we're dead men!                              STANDARD               I don't buy that.  There's still time               to destroy it and get ourselves in               the freezers.                              HUNTER               How?                              STANDARD               It's time for drastic remedies.                              ROBY               It was time for that a couple days               ago.                              STANDARD               That kind of remark is pointless.               Now come on -- I want to hear every               suggestion you can come up with, no               matter how wild.                              HUNTER               We can't kill it on board.  It's huge               now and must have tremendous amounts               of that acid in its body.                              ROBY               I've got an idea, but you're not               going to like it.                              STANDARD               Let's hear it.                              ROBY               Okay.  First we shut down all the               cooling systems on the stardrive               engines.                              STANDARD               That'll blow the ship up.                              ROBY               Right... but it'll take a few minutes               for the engines to overheat and melt               down the core.  In the meantime, we               get in the lifeboat and leave the               ship.                              HUNTER               Blow the ship up?                              ROBY               And the creature with it.  We can               make it back to Irth in the               lifeboat.                              STANDARD               But the lifeboat can't accelerate to               light speed.                              ROBY               Doesn't matter -- we're already at               light speed.  And when we get back to               the Colonies, they'll pick us up in               the network.                              HUNTER               What about all the minerals and               elements in the cargo hold?  That's               the only reason we came out here.               We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd               be broke.                              ROBY               Our lives are more important.               Anyway, we can take a small amount               of the most valuable stuff with us               on the lifeboat.                              STANDARD               No, it won't work and I just               realized why.  There's only one               hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat.               Only one of us could survive.                              ROBY               Yeah... I forgot.                              STANDARD               But the idea's good, if we could               just turn it around somehow.     They think.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)               If we could just get the creature               into the lifeboat, we could launch               it into space and blow it up.                              HUNTER               Good!  That's good!                              STANDARD               We can load the lifeboat up with               explosives and trigger them               remotely, once the lifeboat is in               space.                              ROBY               I think it's going to be almost               impossible to drive it up into the               lifeboat.                              HUNTER               We can use the flamethrower.                              ROBY               It's not going to work.                              STANDARD               You can't say that; I think it's a               good plan.                              HUNTER               The flamethrower needs more fuel.                              STANDARD               Right.  We've got a lot to               accomplish.  Let's get moving.     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY     The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship.     A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.     LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUS     SHAPES.  Each container is well packed and labelled.                              HUNTER               Which explosive should we use?                              STANDARD               I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're               portable, and they can be radio               detonated.     Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like     broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.     Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches     one of them.                              ROBY               You know, it's funny -- this stuff               we went to so much trouble to dig up               -- this treasure, the paydirt --               it'll make it back to Irth just fine               -- even if we're not with it.                              STANDARD               Here, carry these.     Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.                              ROBY                    (grabbing at him)               Hey watch it!                              STANDARD                    (grinning)               It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop               it.     They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR     The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when     Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.                              HUNTER               Hold it!     They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and     points the tracker around.                              HUNTER (CONT'D)                    (nodding up some steps)               Up there.     They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks     up the flamethrower.                              ROBY               So what do we do?  Do we ignore it               and finish loading the explosives               into the boat -- or do we flush it               out now?                              STANDARD               Now.  If we can get it into the boat,               we won't have to blow it up -- we               can just eject it into space.     Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.     INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL     Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps.     Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes.     Then he continues up.     EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE     The view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up     the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.     Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS     OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the     movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass     periodically.                              STANDARD                    (shouts)               You can come up!  It's safe!     The others come up the steps.                              ROBY                    (spying the corpse)               Oh -- Jesus --     Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn     loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.                              STANDARD               The ship's gravitational attraction               must have drawn him back.                              HUNTER                    (horrified)               Should we go outside and bring him               in?                              STANDARD               No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps               after we've destroyed the thing.     Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard     remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP     The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and     ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This     passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.     The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the     equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an     extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and     beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount     of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more.                              STANDARD                    (pointing)               Along the base of the walls there.     They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls     on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.                              HUNTER               This should do it.                              ROBY               I should hope so!  And we'd better               make sure it's pretty far from the               ship when we blow it.                              STANDARD               It will be.                              HUNTER                    (surveys the craft uneasily)               What we really need is some red meat               in here for bait.                              ROBY               Well, if we had some, I'd eat it.               I'm starting to get hungry.     By this time, they are exiting.     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP                              STANDARD               Well... now we have to herd that               thing up here.                              HUNTER                    (nervously)               Whoever's doing the herding is gonna               have their hands pretty full.  I               think somebody should stay by the               lifeboat to slam the door on the               thing once it's inside, and to serve               as... as...                     (searches for a word)                              ROBY               Isn't ""bait"" the word you used?                              HUNTER               Hey look, somebody has to have his               hands free to lock the creature in               the lifeboat!                              STANDARD               Yes, and maybe launch the boat and               blow it too... if the others are               injured.                              ROBY               Who gets the privilege?     INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up.     ANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see     it.  It has a big X on it.     ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device     like a transistor radio.                              HUNTER               Just keep your finger off the button               till she's way away from the ship,               that's all.                              ROBY               Is it armed?                              HUNTER               If you press the button right now,               it will blow the whole nose of the               ship off.                              ROBY               Thanks for the thought.                    (puts detonator in his                     breast pocket)                              STANDARD               All right, Martin, we'll be in touch               with you on the communicator.                              ROBY               And you'll let me know when you've               got it coming this way...                               STANDARD               And you stand aside while we drive               it in, then shut the hatch, launch               the boat, and --                              ROBY               Kablooey.     Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.                              STANDARD               Come on; we haven't much time, air               is a factor.     They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower,     Hunter the tracker.     Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to     familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to ""READY.""     Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:                              STANDARD                    (over, filtered)               We've got something on the               tracker... got to be it, it's               too big for the cat.     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO     THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.                              HUNTER                    (over, filtered)               It's coming from down there.     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,     breathing, etc.     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP     Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at     the tracker.                              HUNTER               It must have stopped moving.  I'm not               getting anything.                              STANDARD               Let me go first; you stay behind me.     Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS     OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.     HUNTER SCREAMS.     Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.     Standard doesn't know what to do.                              HUNTER               The flamethrower!                              STANDARD               I can't, the acid will pour out!     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN     MORTAL AGONY.     Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires     -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER     CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.     Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of     flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP     Roby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the     shrieks and crashing noises.     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.                              ROBY               Hello?  Standard?  Hunter?     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his     expression that he expects none.     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps     into the maintenance level.     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.     INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal     ladder to the floor.     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.     Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps     violently.                              STANDARD                    (a feeble whisper)               Kill me...                               ROBY                    (sickened)               What did it do to you?                              STANDARD                    (moves his head slightly)               Look...      Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.                              STANDARD (CONT'D)                    (whispering)               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...                               ROBY                    (looking around for a tool)               I'll get you out of there.                              STANDARD               No... don't...                               ROBY               But I can save you -- get you to the               Autodoc!                              STANDARD               No good... it's eaten too much of               me...                               ROBY                    (in horror)               What can I do?                              STANDARD               Kill me...      Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and     scrambles back up the ladder.     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.     At length, he regains control of himself.     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters     rolling past in the infinite distance.     INTERIOR - BRIDGE     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a     little oxygen tank on it.                              ROBY               Kitty go bye-bye.     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in     front.  It YOWLS.     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal     cannisters.                              ROBY                    (reading from labels)               What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how               about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of               it.  This'll buy us an island on some               nice planet.     Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries     back up the steps.     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM     Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine     room, containing the massive stardrive engines.     He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the     engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one     by one.     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.                              COMPUTER               Attention!  The cooling units for the               stardrive engines are not               functioning!  Engines will overload               in 4 minutes, 50 seconds!  Attention!     Finally Roby closes the last switch.  Shaking with nervousness, he     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the     engine room.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Roby hurries on, listening to the siren.                              COMPUTER               Attention!  Engines will overheat and               main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30               seconds!     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP     Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed.  Hands full,     he starts to enter the connecting passageway.     INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAY     THE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THE     LIFEBOAT.     It HISSES and starts toward him.     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP     Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws     the switch.  The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the     lifeboat.                              COMPUTER               Attention!  Engines will overload in               4 minutes!     Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat ""LAUNCH"" button.  The thing can     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the     ship as he sprints for the engine room.                              COMPUTER               Attention!  Engines will overload in               3 minutes, 30 seconds!     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM     The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.  The room is full of     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit     switches.     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.                              COMPUTER               Attention!  Engines will overload in               3 minutes!     Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.                              ROBY               Computer!  I've turned all the               cooling units back on!  What's wrong?                              COMPUTER               The reaction has proceeded too far.               The core has begun to melt.  Engines               will overload in 2 minutes, 35               seconds.     A look of terror comes onto Roby's face.  He turns and runs from the     engine room.     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time     up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:                              COMPUTER               Attention!  Engines will overload in               2 minutes!     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP     Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where     the lifeboat is berthed.  He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward     the passageway.     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.     Then he advances on the passageway.     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on     by the siren and the computer:                              COMPUTER               Attention!  Engines will explode in               90 seconds!     He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his     head into the lifeboat.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     HIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is     EMPTY.     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY     Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway.     There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.                              COMPUTER               Attention!  Engines will explode in               60 seconds!     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the     seat than he hits the ""LAUNCH"" button.     EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE ""SNARK.""     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates     away from the mother ship.     EXTERIOR - SPACE     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly     circumstances.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches     his head down over it.     EXTERIOR - SPACE     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,     until it is barely a point of light.     THEN IT BLOWS UP.     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL     DIRECTIONS.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed     in orange light.     EXTERIOR - SPACE     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of     his ship and friends.     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.     The cat SCREECHES.     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,     with the door standing open.     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE     GLASS.     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the     catbox.     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull     it on.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it     into a crevice in the wall.     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.     Again he raps on the glass.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER                              ROBY               Try a little of this, you fucking               bastard.     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid     begins to flow from the wound.     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.           EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't     let go.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and     yanks it.     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END     OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:                              ""RAM JETS""     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the     creature is wriggling.  THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN     SHUT OFF.     INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT     Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE     The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a     writhing, smoking, foaming mass.     As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats --     then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling     into infinity.                                                            DISSOLVE TO:     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He     seems calm and composed, almost cheerful.  The cat purrs in his lap.                              ROBY                    (dictating)               ... So it looks like I'll make it               back to the Colonies on schedule               after all.  I should be to the               frontier in another 250 years or so,               and then with a little luck the               network will pick me up.  I'm not as               rich as I was a couple days ago --               but I'm not exactly broke either.               Incidentally, I did manage to               salvage one souvenir out of this               whole mess.     He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls     out the ALIEN SKULL.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               Poor Yorick here should go at least               partway toward proving I'm not a               crank.  I wish it was him we'd met in               the first place -- things might have               turned out different.     He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.                              ROBY (CONT'D)               This is Martin Roby, executive               officer, last survivor of the               commercial vessel SNARK, signing off.               Come on, cat, let's go to sleep.     Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder.  Then he rises and,     carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open.     He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against     his chest.  With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER     HIM.     CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering     Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE     The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth,     250 years from now.     As SNARK 2 drifts past camera, we suddenly see that A SPORE POD IS     ADHERED TO THE UNDERBELLY OF THE CRAFT.     ROLL END TITLES & MUSIC.

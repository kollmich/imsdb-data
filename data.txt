- priorities, i suppose did you think you would make one?problem is there's nothing to rhyme it with - put  - it's not a noun doesn't matter  along he came and he did put   upon my farm his clumsy foot we should have a story now when i tell a story to my nieces at home   one of them always provides the first sentence - anything?

- quiet! one question at a time the war is in europe  how do we know they're going to reach here?german east is only 200 miles south  general von lettow is there i don't want to wait until he joins us at the bar - would we engage them? - blix, this is our war you don't have to be involved, but thanks i've got crops coming in  how long's this thing gonna last?we just have to stay and go as we must they won't fight if we won't fight we could always arm the masai and point them south do you want the job of collecting rifles from the masai when this is over?what about our women and children? should we bring them into town?we will deal with that problem as it arises - will they use native troops? - i'd assume so, but not masai berkeley, what about your somalis?they'd make very good scouts  we could cover the area from here to the border we could gather information for when the regulars arrive what's it about? have you any idea?- not really  - then why do you want to get into it?- well    - it's got nothing to do with us they've made agreements we know nothing about victoria and the kaiser were relatives, for god's sake they've divided africa between them  do you know why there's a border?because she had two mountains, and he had none so she gave him kilimanjaro it's a silly argument between two spoiled countries the sooner it ends, the sooner we pick up where we left off it may end   but we're not going to pick up where we left off you don't have to go - you want to go  - we've got to live here they have made it plain they don't want you - i'll have to show them where we stand  - i'm not so fond of their empire   i'd have you shot for it more likely chewed on than shot the farm will take care of itself, and you've got belknap the farm will not take care of itself that's not the point i didn't expect to like you so much you're not going to go falling in love, are you?not with someone who's always leaving if you need me, send a runner to find delamere that's where i'll be that's a fine kiss goodbye i am better at hello it's an odd feeling    farewell there is some envy in it men go off to be tested for courage if we're tested at all, it's for patience   for doing without   for how well we can endure loneliness but i had always known that it didn't require a war i said goodbye to bror denys left without a word   which was quite proper hello, the house!felicity!i thought you might want some meat - is there any word?

- well enough to send the message and where would my husband like this wagon sent?he's with delamere on the border near lake natron that's confidential, of course i will bear that in mind, lieutenant i only meant it wouldn't do for it to be talk around nairobi and we're going to have to move you into town  we can't protect you here what do you mean?with the men gone, we're worried about the native element  we have orders women and children into town that is internment, lieutenant women and children, baroness - is that one category or two?

- yes  take good care - we're behind a story or two  - yes  when i get back back? from where?when you get back, i meant - i thought it was malaria  - well, it wasn't you may be all right, but you have to be seen and the others, whoever they are i hope they've got it it's my fault  no one else's i want to go with you no  someone has to stay here and run things and the factory must be finished - can you do that?

- because they live now they don't think about the future they can't grasp the idea that they'll be let out one day they think it's permanent so they die they're the only ones out here that don't care about us   and that is what will finish them what did the two of you ever find to talk about?nothing so  you knew i would come it's an early day tomorrow  why don't you get some sleep?- and what happens tomorrow?

fair enough  - what?i, lord kelvin, hereby vowto surrender my position as minister of science to phileas fogg   - no! - no! no!if he can circumnavigate the globe   in no more than 80 days but if he cannot,he must never set foot in this academy again,he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore he calls a laboratory,and he must swear   never to invent again just as i always suspected, fogg you promise so much, yet you deliver   oh, nothing - i'll take your wager  - what did you say?i'll take your wager!he did it then it's done a man who has never set foot out of england circling the globe this is going to be rather amusing history won't remember your amusement, but it will be hard-pressed to forgetthe moment i'm standing on the very top step of the royal academy of science by the strike of noon,after i, phileas fogg, have traveled around the worldin 80 days!oh, dear mr  fogg, we all pack and ready to go  mr  fogg, are you in here?phileas! phileas! phileas!- uh    -

what?what does it say?eddie thomason will be showing his inventions thomas edison? here in paris?what a chance for you to meet another great inventor i would quite like to tell him about my whistle modification good idea see? exposition  science i assure you these are not the works of thomas edison uh, i think he is somewhere around here wait a moment  this isn't science this is art - yeah  - hmm that painting is highly inaccurate it's not supposed to be accurate the artist views reality through imaginationrather than simply recording it it is called \"lmpressionism \"well, um, i'm not impressed trees are not violet, grass is not charcoal,and a man cannot   fly you feel something you dream of flying or of naked men -

- yeah, vaguely we have attorneys for this slain police officer camping in our offices we have his mother and a half dozen men of the clothwho swear that lewis was one of the twelve apostles of christ we have two black city councilmenand a congresswoman who call on the hour, every hour,demanding to know what the district attorney intends to do about this and you want him to walk into that press roomand tell them all that the situation is complicated?give us a minute no problem who knows about the money?you gotta be kiddin' me there are only two people in this room myself, my partner, ferguson and internal affairs - jim ferguson? - yeah okay  i guess i don't see a problem as it wasn't lewis's car, the money isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing and even if it was, we aren't going to prosecute a dead man which means the money internal affairs is holding can't be considered evidence you can do this dance if you want to,but i'm willing to bet when the coroner's report comes back tomorrowit's going to say that detective lewis was coked out of his head fucking black people, huh?what did you just say?i mean,i know all the sociological reasons why per capitaeight times more black men are incarcerated than white men schools are a disgrace  lack of opportunity  bias in the judicial system all that stuff  all that stuff!but still, it's gotta get to you, on a gut level as a black man they just can't keep their hands out of the cookie jar of course, you and i know that's not the truth but that's the way it always plays, doesn't it?and assholes like lewis keep feeding the flames  it's gotta get to you what did you say you did for the d a  again?you coach ball down in compton  am i right?oh, please, don't do that don't act like you know something about me, okay?what do you think those kids need    to make them believe, to give them hope?you think they need another drug-dealing copor do you think they need a fallen black hero?why don't you cut through the bullshit and just tell me what it is you want the d a 's squad loses its lead investigator next month rick is quite adamant that his replacement be a person of color it's a high-profile position, and he wants to send the right message to the community and the right message is, \"look at this black boy i just bought?\"well, fuck you very much  but thanks for thinking of me actually we were thinking of you until we saw that it's your brother's file twenty-something years old and already three felonies three strikes law  kid's going away for life for stealing a car christ, that's a shitty law there's a warrant in there but still, hey, he had every opportunity you had fucking black people, huh?so all, uh    all i need to do to make this disappearis to frame a potentially innocent man?what are you? the fucking defender of all things white?we're talking about a white man who shot three black men and you're arguing with me that maybe we're not being fair to him?you know what? maybe you're right  maybe lewis did provoke this and maybe he got exactly what was coming to him or maybe stoned or not, just being a black man in the valleywas enough to get him killed there was no one there to see who shot first, so there is no way to know which means we could get this wrong maybe that's what happened with your brother  maybe we got it wrong maybe lewis isn't the only one who deserves the benefit of the doubt you're the one closest to all this you need to tell us what does your gut tell you?so? graham?what do i tell 'em?you tell me, and i'll tell them well, i think given detective conklin's history,it's pretty clear what happened last night okay before i get to why we're here,i know that many of you have heard we had our car stolen last night and as you could imagine, my wife and i are both pretty shaken up but we're okay and jean and i truly appreciate all your calls and your concern  thank you now, just after 9 '00 p m  last night, detective william lewis,an eight-year veteran of the force and an active member of the black community,was gunned down by a fellow officer get outta the car!gimme the keys! get out    what the fuck?whoa! what the fuck are you doing, man?shit! you wanna get killed, nigger?say that again!- say that again! - you stupid motherfucker!say it again, huh! call me a nigger again!- man, what the fuck?

we must not divide our forces  - do it    and let the english see you do it they'll think we run away?take out their archers  i'll meet you in the middle right  come on <i>ego vos absolvo   </i><i>   ab omnibus peccatis vestris  in nomine patris   </i>insolent bastard! i want this wallace's heart on a plate!archers!archers forward!you bastards!the lord tells me he can get me out of this mess      but he's pretty sure you're fucked ready    loose!ride!see? every scot with a horse is fleeing our cavalry will ride them down like grass  send the horse full attack steady   hold!hold!hold!hold!now!- send the infantry  -

that's two more than we've had  - it gets better just got our latest scintillating assignment you know, the russians have the h-bomb, the nazis are repatriating south america      the chinese have a standing army of 2 8 million      and i am doing stress tests on a dam you made the cover of fortune again please note the use of the word \"you,\" not \"we \"that was supposed to be just me not only do they rob me of the fields' medal      they put me on the cover of fortune magazine with these hacks      these scholars of trivia exactly what's the difference between genius and most genius?quite a lot he's your son  anyway, you've got 10 minutes -

hey, hey!hi!we have a little problem it's extremely hot in here with the windows closed       and extremely noisy with them open i was wondering if there was any way you could      i don't know, maybe work someplace else for about 45 minutes?- not a problem  - thank you so much!- break! - got it!let's go  clean it up a little bit as you will find in multivariable calculus, there is often      a number of solutions for any given problem as i was saying, this problem here      will take some of you many months to solve for others among you      it will take you the term of your natural lives professor nash william parcher big brother      at your service what can i do for the department of defense?- are you here to give me a raise? - let's take a walk - impressive work at the pentagon  - yes, it was oppenheimer used to say, \"a genius sees the answer before the question \"you knew oppenheimer?his project was under my supervision which project?- that project  - it's not that simple well, you ended the war we incinerated 150,000 people in a heartbeat great deeds come at great cost, mr  parcher conviction, it turns out, is a luxury of those on the sidelines, mr  nash i'll try and keep that in mind so, john, no family      no close friends - why is that? - i like to think it's because i'm a ione wolf but mainly it's because people don't like me there are certain endeavors      where your lack of personal connection would be considered an advantage - this is a secure area  - they know me have you ever been here?we were told in our initial briefing these warehouses were abandoned that's not precisely accurate by telling you this      i am increasing your security clearance to top secret disclosure of secure information can result in imprisonment get it?what operation?those are a good idea this factory is in berlin, we seized it at the end of the war nazi engineers were attempting to build a portable atomic bomb the soviets reached this facility before we did, and we lost the damn thing the routing orders at the pentagon they were about this, weren't they?the soviets aren't as unified as people believe a faction of the red army calling itself novaya svoboda      the \"new freedom,\" has control of the bomb      and intends to detonate it on u s  soil their plan is to incur maximum civilian casualties man is capable of as much atrocity as he has imagination new freedom has sleeper agents here in the u s mccarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately, that doesn't make him wrong new freedom communicates to its agents      through codes imbedded in newspapers and magazines      and that's where you come in you see, john, what distinguishes you      is that you are, quite simply      the best natural code-breaker i have ever seen what exactly is it that you would like me to do?commit this list of periodicals to memory scan each new issue, find any hidden codes, decipher them place your chin on the chin rest - stare into the light  - pulse 88, regular okay, this may be a little uncomfortable it's got a little zap to it, doesn't it?he just implanted a radium diode don't worry, it's safe the isotope decays predictably as a result, these numbers change over time they're the access codes to your drop spot so what am i now, a spy?come boy, you must be really important it's all right, mike what are you working on?classified everyone waited half an hour - for? - class you missed class today oh  i suspect that      nobody missed me the problem that you left on the board      i solved it - no, you didn't  - you didn't even look i never said that the vector fields were rational functions your solution is elegant though on this particular occasion      ultimately incorrect - you're still here  - i'm still here why?i'm wondering, professor nash      if i can ask you to dinner you do eat, don't you?on occasion, yeah table for one  prometheus alone chained to the rock      with the bird circling overhead, you know how it is no, i expect that you wouldn't know   leave your address with my office  i'll pick you up friday      at 8:00 and we'll eat one more thing  do you have a name, or should i just keep calling you \"miss\"?governor   -

i often don't get a pleasant result  - try me all right i find you attractive your aggressive moves towards me indicate that you feel the same way but still, ritual requires that we continue with a number of platonic activities      before we have sex i am proceeding with those activities      but in point of actual fact      all i really want to do is have intercourse with you as soon as possible are you going to slap me now?how was that result?what are you doing?trying to isolate patterned reoccurrences within periodicals over time and you?you talk funny, mr  nash do i know you?my uncle says you're very smart but not very nice      so i shouldn't pay no mind if you're mean to me and who might your uncle be?the prodigal roommate      returns come here, charles my sister got herself killed in a car crash not too far now, marcee!her cowboy husband was too drunk to know that he was too drunk to drive so, i took her in -

was he at your wedding? - he had to teach have you seen a picture, or talked to him on the phone?this is ridiculous i phoned princeton according to their housing records, john lived alone now, which is more likely? that your husband      a mathematician with no military training      is a spy fleeing the russians    - you're making him sound crazy or, that he has lost his grip on reality?the only way i can help him, is to show him the difference      between what is real and what is in his mind come on what's he been working on?his work is classified he mentioned a supervisor      by the name of william parcher maybe mr  parcher can clarify things for us but i can't get to him without clearances you want me to help you get the details of my husband's work?john thinks i'm a russian spy is that what you think?- what did the doctor say? - is he sick?i don't know i want to see what john's been working on - you can't go in his office  - it's classified, alicia stop oh, my god oh, my god why didn't you say something?alicia, john has always been      a little weird he said he was doing code-breaking - it was eyes-only  - top-secret, part of the military effort was he?it was possible directives come down all the time that some aren't cleared for - it was possible  - possible, but not likely lately, he'd become much more agitated, and then when you called   so, is this all he's been doing every day?cutting up magazines?well, not all - i'm so sorry  - it's okay i missed you i have to talk to you okay alicia, i've been thinking about it      and i do realize that my behavior      and my inability to discuss the situation with you      must have appeared insane i left you with no other choice i do understand   -    and i'm truly sorry  - that's okay everything will be all right everything will be all right we just have to talk quietly they may be listening  there may be microphones i'll tell you everything now it's breaking with protocol, but you need to know      because you have to help me get out of here i've been doing top-secret work for the government there's a threat that exists      of catastrophic proportions i think the russians feel my profile is too high that's why they won't do away with me they're keeping me here to try to stop me from doing my work you have to get to wheeler - you have to find william parcher  - stop stop!i went to wheeler good, good there is no william parcher of course there is  i've been working for him doing what? breaking codes?dropping packages in a secret mailbox for the government to pick up?how could you know that?sol followed you -

hello i've been studying your equilibrium that you wrote here at princeton to come up with something totally original, the way you did   you know, i was young i've been developing a theory i believe i can prove      that galois extensions are covering spaces that everything is connected  that it's all part of the same subject when was the last time you ate?- excuse me? -

antitrust cases? - yes i never would have considered that have i just reached some level of honesty that borders on stupidity?- no, you haven't  - i wouldn't have thought of that shall we have tea?i don't go in there  i usually take my sandwich in the library come on, john  let's have some tea  it's a big day most commercially available brands of tea are not suitable to my palate i'm not   there are some northern indian teas which are dense enough   i enjoy the flavor that they have  i have not been in this room      for quite some many years  i wonder what tea they serve why, thank you, young lady things have certainly changed around here  i have a son that age harvard hmm i would have thought the nominations for the nobel prize would've been secret i would have thought you'd only find out if you won or lost that is generally the case, yes, but these are special circumstances the awards are substantial they require private funding as such      the image of the nobel is   i see, you came here to find out if i was crazy?find out if i would screw everything up if i actually won?dance around the podium, strip naked and squawk like a chicken?something like that, yes would i embarrass you?yes, it is possible you see, i   i am crazy i take the newer medications      but i still see things that are not here i just choose not to acknowledge them like a diet of the mind, i choose not to indulge certain appetites like my appetite for patterns perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream professor nash it's good to have you here, john thank you -

gracchus all rome rejoices in your return, caesar but there are many matters that require your attention to order, please  to order for your guidance, caesar,the senate has prepared a series of protocolsto begin addressing the many problems in the city,beginning with basic sanitation for the greek quarter,to combat the plague which is already springing up there so, if caesar   don't you see, gracchus?that's the very problem, isn't it?my father spent all his time at study,at books of learning and philosophy he spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the senate and all the while, the people were forgotten but the senate is the people, sire,chosen from among the people to speak for the people i doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, gracchus or have such splendid mistresses, gaius i think i understand my own people then perhaps caesar will be so good as to teach us,out of his own extensive experience i call it love i am their father  the people are my children and i shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?no, but if you interrupt me again,i assure you that you shall senator, my brother is very tired leave your list with me  caesar shall do all that rome requires my lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience who are they to lecture me?commodus, the senate has its uses what uses? all they do is talk it should be just you and me and rome don't even think it  there's always been a senate rome has changed it takes an emperor to rule an empire of course, but leave the people their   illusions?traditions my father's war against the barbarians he said it himself, it achieved nothing  but the people loved him the people always love victories why? they didn't see the battles what do they care about germania?they care about the greatness of rome \"the greatness of rome  \"well, what is that?it's an idea  greatness - greatness is a vision  - exactly  a vision do you not see, lucilla?i will give the people a vision of rome, and they'll love me for it and they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men i will give the people the greatest vision of their lives white and red wine for your drinking pleasure!games one hundred and fifty days of games he's cleverer than i thought clever  the whole of rome would be laughing at him,if they werert so afraid of his praetorians fear and wonder  a powerful combination you really think the people are going to be seduced by that?i think he knows what rome is  rome is the mob conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted take away their freedom, and still they'll roar the beating heart of rome is not the marble of the senate it's the sand of the colosseum he'll bring them death,and they will love him for it all you do is kill, kill, kill the crowd don't want a butcher, they want a hero we want them to keep coming back so don'tjust hack them to pieces, remember you are an entertainer spaniard so entertain!are you not entertained? are you not entertained?is this not why you're here?spaniard! spaniard! spaniard!- spaniard! spaniard! spaniard! - spaniard! spaniard! spaniard!what do you want?girl?boy?- you sent for me  - yes, i did you're good, spaniard, but you're not that good you could be magnificent i'm required to kill, so i kill  that is enough that's enough for the provinces, but not for rome the young emperor has arranged a series of spectaclesto commemorate his father, marcus aurelius i find that amusing,since it was marcus aurelius, the wise,the all-knowing marcus aurelius, that closed us down so finally, after five years of scratching a livingin flea-infested villages,we're finally going back to where we belong the colosseum you should see the colosseum, spaniard fifty thousand romans,watching every movement of your sword,willing you to make that killer blow the silence before you strike and the noise afterwards it rises  it rises up,like a storm as if you were the thunder god himself - you were a gladiator? - yes, i was you won your freedom?a long time ago, the emperorpresented me with a rudius it's just a wooden sword the symbol of your freedom he touched me on the shoulder, and i was free you knew marcus aurelius?i did not say i knew him  i said he touched me on the shoulder once you asked me what i want i, too, want to stand in front of the emperor,as you did then listen to me  learn from me i wasrt the best because i killed quickly i was the best because the crowd loved me win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom i will win the crowd i will give them something they've never seen before so, spaniard, we shall go to rome togetherand have bloody adventures and the great whore will suckle usuntil we are fat and happy and can suckle no more and then,when enough men have died,perhaps you will have your freedom here  use this it's somewhere out there, my country my home my wife is preparing food my daughters carry water from the river will i ever see them again?i think, no do you believe you'll see them again when you die?i think so but then, i will die soon they will not die for many years i'll have to wait but you would? wait?of course you see,my wife and my sonare already waiting for me you'll meet them again  but not yet not yet -

stay with me tonight  - you know i won't then kiss me sleep, brother having servants who are deaf and muteat least ensures i live a little longer they're arresting scholars now anyone who dare speak out  even satirists and chroniclers and mathematicians and all to feed the arena the senate did not approve martial law this reign of terror is entirely the praetorians i'm afraid to go out after dark you should be more afraid of your activities during the day the senate is full of his spies, led by that whore master, falco but what is in his mind? that's what i trouble myselfwith he spends all his days singularly obsessed,planning the festival to honor your father he neglects even the most fundamental task of government so just what is he planning?and what pays for it?these daily games are costing a fortune, yet we have no new taxes the future the future pays for it he's started selling the grain reserves this can't be true he's selling rome's reserves of grain the people will be starving in two years i hope they're enjoying the games,because soon enough they'll be dead because of them - rome must know this  - and how?he's going to dissolve the senate and who will tell them before it's too late? you, gracchus?you, gaius will you make a speech on the floor of the senate,denouncing my brother?and then see your family in the colosseum?who'd dare?i have been living in a prison of fear every day,because my son is heir to the throne he must die quintus and the praetorians would simply seize control for themselves no  cut off the head and the snake cannot strike lucilla, gaius is right until we can neutralize the praetorians, we can achieve nothing so we do nothing?no, child  we keep our counsel we prepare as long as the people support him, we are voices without steel we are air but with every day that passes, he makes enemies one day, he'll have more enemies than friends and on that day, we will act then we will strike but until then,we are docile we are obedient and we are treacherous come on!all right, that's enough the emperor wants battles,and i don't want to sacrifice my best fighters the crowd wants battles, so the emperor gives them battles - you get the battle of can'thage  - massacre of can'thage well, why don't you go down to the prison,round up all the beggars and thieves?we've done that if you want to give away the best gladiatorsin the whole of the empire,then i want double the rates you'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled you don't like it?then you can crawl back down that shit hole that you came from cassius, please  you can free us gladiator, are you the one they call the spaniard?yes they said you were a giant they said you could crush a mars skull with one hand a mars? no a boy's -

    to the present administration  - i still say, let sleeping dogs lie the king does not agree with you what kind of pressure do you think you can bring to bear?i have evidence that sir thomas, while he was a judge, accepted bribes what?goddammit! he was the only judge since cato who didn't accept bribes!when was there a chancellor whose possessions, after three years   totaled \u00e2\u00a3100 and a gold chain?it is, as you imply, common practice   but a practice may be common and remain an offence this offence could send a man to the tower come here this woman's name is averil machin  she comes from leicester - she entered a case    - a property case it was shut your mouth a property case in the court of requests in april, 1528 and got a wicked false judgment!and got an impeccably correct judgment from sir thomas - no, sir, it was not! - tell the gentleman   about the gift you gave the judge i gave him a cup, sir a silver italian cup i bought in leicester, for 100 shillings did sir thomas accept this cup?yes, sir, he did he did accept it  we can corroborate that  you can go - to my way of thinking    - go!- is that your witness? - no by an odd coincidence that cup later came into the hands of master rich here how?- he gave it to me, your grace  - gave it to you? why?a gift yes, you were a friend, weren't you?when did thomas give you this thing?i can't exactly remember do you \"remember\" what you did with it?- i sold it  - where?- a shop  - has the shop still got it?no  they've lost all track of it how convenient you doubt master rich's word, your grace?it had occurred to me this is the bill of sale that cow put her case into court in april, you said  this is dated may in other words, the moment thomas knew the cup was a bribe   he dropped it into the nearest gutter the facts will bear that interpretation, i suppose this is a horse that won't run, master secretary just a trial gallop  we'll find something better - i want no part of it  - you have no choice what's that you say?the king particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of sir thomas he's not told me that indeed? he told me look here, cromwell   what's the purpose of all this?there you have me it's a matter of conscience, i think the king wants sir thomas to bless his marriage if sir thomas appeared at the wedding now, it might save us all a lot of trouble he won't attend the wedding if i were you, i'd try and persuade him i really would try, if i were you cromwell, are you threatening me?my dear norfolk, this isn't spain this is england!thomas? thomas!lady margaret?yes we've been cutting greens  we use them for fuel i have a letter for your father, lady margaret  from hampton court he's to answer certain charges before secretary cromwell good of you to come, sir thomas master rich will make a record of our conversation good of you to tell me, master secretary i think you know one another indeed yes, we're old friends that's a nice gown you have, richard sir thomas, believe me no, that's asking too much  but let me tell you all the same you have no more sincere admirer than myself no, not yet, rich, not yet if i might hear the charges - the charges? - i understand there are certain charges some ambiguities of behavior i should like to clarify, hardly charges make a note of that, will you, master rich? there are no charges sir thomas, sir thomas the king is not pleased with you i am grieved and yet, do you know that even now, if you could bring yourself   to agree with the church, universities, the lords and the commons   there is no honor which his majesty would be likely to deny you?i am well acquainted with his grace's generosity very well you have heard of the so-called \"holy maid of kent\"   who was executed for prophesying against the king?- yes, i met her  - yes, you met her yet you did not warn his majesty of her treason  how was that?she spoke no treason  our talk was not political but the woman was notorious  do you expect me to believe that?- happily, there were witnesses  - you wrote a letter to her yes  i wrote, advising her to abstain from meddling in the affairs of state i have a copy of the letter  also witnessed - you have been cautious  - i like to keep my affairs regular in the june of 1521, the king published a book a theological work it was called, a defense of the seven sacraments for which he was named \"defender of the faith\" by his holiness, the pope by the bishop of rome, or do you insist on \"pope\"?no  \"bishop of rome\" if you like  it doesn't alter his authority thank you  you come to the point very readily  what is that authority?for example, in the church of england   what exactly is the bishop of rome's authority?you will find it very ably set out and defended, master secretary   in the king's book in the book published under the king's name, would be more accurate - you wrote this book  - i wrote no part of it i don't mean you actually held the pen i answered to my best ability, some points of common law   which the king put to me, as i was bound to do do you deny you instigated it?it was from first to last the king's own project the king says not the king knows the truth of it and whatever he may have said to you   he will not give evidence to support this accusation why not?because evidence is given on oath, and he will not perjure himself if you don't know that, then you don't yet know him sir thomas more have you anything to say   regarding the king's marriage with queen anne?i understood i was not to be asked that again then you understood wrongly  these charges   they are terrors for children, master secretary, not for me!then know that the king commands me to charge you   in his name, with great ingratitude!and to tell you that there never was, nor could be, so villainous a servant   nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!so   i am brought here at last brought?you've brought yourself to where you stand now you may go for the present what will you do now?whatever's necessary boat!oh, come, come, it's not as bad as all that!howard!i can't get home they won't bring me a boat do you blame them?is it as bad as that?it's every bit as bad as that!then it's good of you to be seen with me i followed you were you followed?- you're dangerous to know! - then don't know me - i do know you  - i mean as a friend - i am your friend  i wish i wasn't, but i am  - what's to be done then?- give in  - i can't give in, howard our friendship's more mutable than that the one fixed point in the world of turning friendship   -     is that sir more won't give in  - to me it has to be, for that's myself affection goes as deep in me as you, i think but only god is love right through, howard, and that's my self and who are you?a lawyer! and a lawyer's son!we're supposed to be the proud ones, the arrogant ones, we've all given in why must you stand out?goddammit man! it's disproportionate!you'll break my heart no one is safe, howard, and you have a son we'll end our friendship now - for friendship's sake? - yes daft!norfolk, you're a fool!you can't place a quarrel, you haven't the style hear me out  you and your class have given in, as you rightly call it   'cause this country's religion means nothing to you at all well, that's a foolish saying for a start!the nobility of england   the nobility of england would have snored through the sermon on the mount!but you'll labor like scholars over a bulldog's pedigree an artificial quarrel is not a quarrel we've had a quarrel since the day we met  our friendship was mere sloth you can be cruel when you want, but i've always known that what do you value in your bulldogs? gripping, is it not?- yes  - it's their nature?- yes  - it's why you breed them?it's so with men i will not give in, because i oppose it not my pride, not my spleen, nor any other of my appetites, but i do, i is there, in the midst of all this muscle, no sinew that serves no appetite   of norfolk's, but is just norfolk? there is!- give that some exercise, my lord! - thomas!as you stand you'll go before your maker ill conditioned!now steady and he'll think that, somewhere back along your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!cast in this very house on april 3, last year   it is a matter very fit for the commons, gathered here   in parliament, to take in hand or, in consequence of the decay of guilds   the woolen cloth, now coming out of yorkshire, lincoln   and the like, is not to blame and this   i will defer the rest of my matter to later that the loyal commons, here assembled, will speedily enact this bill, i doubt not for as much as it concerns the king's new title and his marriage to queen anne both matters pleasing to a loyal subject mark, my masters   there is among us a brood of discreet traitors   to which deceit the king can brook no longer and we, his loyal huntsmen, must now drive these subtle foxes from their covert father?margaret!i couldn't get a boat what is it, meg?father, there's a new act going through parliament and by this act, they're going to administer an oath   about the marriage on what compulsion is the oath?- high treason  - but what is the wording?do the words matter? we know what it means tell me the words an oath is made of words  it may be possible to take it take it?and if it can be taken, you must take it, too no!listen, meg  god made the angels to show him splendor as he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity but man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind if he suffers us to come to such a case that there is no escaping   then we may stand to our tackle as best we can and yes, meg, then we can clamor like champions, if we have the spittle for it but it's god's part, not our own, to bring ourselves to such a pass our natural business lies in escaping if i can take this oath, i will i would, for my sake, you could take the oath i never took a man into the tower less willingly thank you, master governor thank you sir thomas sir thomas sir thomas!this is iniquitous - where to this time? - richmond palace sit down this is the seventh commission to inquire into the case   of sir thomas more, appointed by his majesty's council have you anything to say?no - seen this document before? - many times it is the act of succession these are the names of those who have sworn to it - i have, as you say, seen it before  - will you swear to it?no thomas, we must know   we must know plainly whether you recognize the offspring of queen anne   as heirs to the throne the king in parliament tells me that they are - of course i recognize them  - will you swear to it?- yes  - then why won't he swear to the act?because there is more than that in the act just so  sir thomas, it states in the preamble that the king's former marriage   to the lady catherine was unlawful   she being his brother's widow and the pope having no authority to sanction it is that what you deny?is that what you dispute?is that what you are not sure of?you insult his majesty and council in the person of the lord archbishop!i insult no one i will not take the oath  i will not tell you why i will not - then your reasons must be treasonable! - not \"must be,\" may be it's a fair assumption!the law requires more than an assumption, the law requires a fact of course, i cannot judge your legal standing in the case   but until i know the ground of your objections   i can only guess your spiritual standing, too if you're willing to guess that, it should be small matter to guess my objections then you do have objections to the act?well, we know that, cromwell!no, my lord, you don't you may suppose i have objections, all you know is that i will not swear to it   for which you cannot lawfully harm me further but if you were right in supposing me to have objections, and right again   in supposing my objections to be treasonable   the law would let you cut my head off oh, yes well done, sir thomas i've been trying to make that clear to his grace for some time oh, confound all this! i'm not a scholar i don't know if the marriage was lawful or not   but damn it, thomas, look at these names why can't you do as i did, and come with us, for fellowship?and when we die, and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience   and i am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?so, those of us whose names are there, are damned, sir thomas?i have no window to look into another man's conscience i condemn no one - then the matter is capable of question? - certainly but that you owe obedience to the king is not capable of question so weigh a doubt against a certainty and sign some men think the earth is round, others think it flat it is a matter capable of question but if it is flat, will the king's command make it round?and if it is round, will the king's command flatten it?no, i will not sign then you have more regard for your own doubt than the king's command?- for myself i have no doubt  - no doubt of what?no doubt that i will not take this oath but why i will not, you, master secretary, will not trick out of me i might get it out of you in other ways you threaten like a dockside bully how should i threaten?like a minister of state, with justice!justice is what you're threatened with then i am not threatened gentlemen, can't i go to bed?aye  the prisoner may retire as he requests - unless you    - i see no purpose in prolonging this then, goodnight, thomas may i have one or two more books?why, you have books?yes i didn't know, you shouldn't have may i see my family?no captain!master secretary?have you ever heard the prisoner speak of the king's divorce, supremacy   -     or the king's marriage? - no, not a word if he does, you will repeat it to me of course rich secretary?tomorrow morning, remove the prisoner's books is that necessary?with regards to this case, the king is becoming impatient - aye, with you  - with all of us the king's impatience will embrace a duke or two master secretary sir redvers llewellyn has retired the attorney general for wales his post is vacant you said that i might approach you not now, rich he must submit  he must!rack him no  the king's conscience will not permit it we have to find some other way sir thomas!father!what? margaret?father!meg  for god's sake, they haven't put you in here?- no, sir, a visit  - a brief one, sir thomas father - good morning, husband  - good morning good morning, will well, this is a hellish place!except it's keeping me from you, my dears, it isn't so bad it's remarkably like any other place - it drips! - yes  it's too near the river well, what is it?father, come out! swear to the act and come out!is this why they've let you come?yes meg's under oath to persuade you that was silly, meg how do you plan to do that?father \"god more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth \"- well, so you've always told me  - yes then say the words of the oath and in your heart think otherwise what is an oath then, but words we say to god?listen, meg when a man takes an oath, he's holding his own self in his own hands   like water and if he opens his fingers then, he needn't hope to find himself again some men aren't capable of this, but i'd be loathed to think your father one of them - i have another argument  - oh, meg in any state that was half good, you would be raised up high, not here   -     for what you've done already  - all right it's not your fault the state's three-quarters bad no if you elect to suffer for it, you elect to be a hero that's very neat but look now  if we lived in a state where virtue was profitable   common sense would make us saintly but since we see that avarice, anger, pride and stupidity   commonly profit far beyond charity, modesty, justice and thought   perhaps we must stand fast a little   even at the risk of being heroes but in reason!haven't you done as much as god can reasonably want?well, finally it isn't a matter of reason finally, it's a matter of love you're content then to be shut up here with mice and rats   -     when you might be home with us? - content?if they'd open a crack that wide, i'd be through it like a bird and back to chelsea i haven't told you what the house is like without you don't, meg - what we do in the evening without you  - meg, have done we don't read because we've no candles we don't talk because we wonder what they're doing to you the king is more merciful  he doesn't use the rack two minutes to go, sir - i thought you'd like to know  - two minutes!- jailer! - sorry, sir  two minutes listen, you must leave the country  all of you must leave the country - and leave you? - it makes no difference they won't let me see you again you must all go on the same day, but not on the same boat - different boats from different ports  - after the trial, then there'll be no trial, they have no case do this for me, i beseech you - will? - yes, sir - margaret? - yes alice?- alice, i command you! - right this is splendid - i know who packed this  - i packed it yes you still make a superlative custard, alice do i?that's a nice dress you have on nice color anyway my god, you think little of me!i know i'm a fool   but i'm not such a fool as to be lamenting for my dresses   or to relish complimenting on my custards i'm well rebuked - alice    - no!i'm sick with fear when i think of the worst they may do to me but worse than that will be to go with you not understanding why i go i don't if you can tell me that you understand, i might make a good death, if i have to - your death's no good to me  - you must tell me that you understand i don't!i don't believe this had to happen!if you say that i don't see how i'm to face it it's the truth!- you're an honest woman  - much good may it do me i'll tell you what i'm afraid of   that when you've gone, i shall hate you for it you mustn't, alice you mustn't as for understanding, i understand you're the best man i ever met or ever likely to and if you go, god knows why i suppose, though as god's my witness   god's kept deadly quiet about it and if any one wants to know my opinion of the king and his council   he only has to ask for it!why, it's a lion i married a lion  a lion this is good it's very good sorry, sir thomas!- oh, for pity's sake! - time's up, sir - but one more minute! - you don't know what you're asking - come along, miss  - for heaven's sake now, don't do that, sir now, madam, don't make trouble come along, please, lady alice take your muddy paws off me!filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!i'll see you suffer for this!goodbye you must understand my position, sir i'm a plain, simple man and i just want to keep out of trouble dear lord jesus, my soul savior, clear my wits dear lady, blessed mother of god, comfort my wife and daughter   and forgive me for them sir thomas more, though you have heinously offended the king's majesty   we hope that if you'll even now fore think and repent of obstinate opinion   you may still taste his gracious pardon my lords, i thank you as for the matters you may charge me with   i fear from my present weakness, that neither my wit   nor my memory will serve   to make sufficient answer i should be glad to sit down a chair for the prisoner master secretary cromwell, have you the charge?- i have, my lord  - then read the charge \"that you did willfully and maliciously deny and deprive   \"our liege, lord henry, of his undoubted certain title   \"supreme head of the church in england \"but, i have never denied this title at westminster hall, at lambeth, and again at richmond   you stubbornly refused the oath was this no denial?no, this was silence and for my silence, i am punished with imprisonment - why have i been called again? - on a charge of high treason, sir thomas for which the punishment is not imprisonment death   comes for us all, my lords yes, even for kings he comes the death of kings is not in question, sir thomas nor mine, i trust, until i'm proven guilty your life lies in your own hands, thomas, as it always has!is that so, my lord?then i'll keep a good grip on it so, sir thomas   you stand on your silence?i do but, gentlemen of the jury   there are many kinds of silence consider first the silence of a man when he is dead suppose we go into the room where he is laid out and we listen what do we hear?silence what does it betoken, this silence?nothing  this is silence pure and simple but let us take another case suppose i were to take a dagger from my sleeve   and make to kill the prisoner with it and my lordships there, instead of crying out for me to stop, maintain their silence that would betoken!it would betoken a willingness that i should do it and under the law, they would be guilty with me so silence can, according to the circumstances   speak let us consider now the circumstances of the prisoner's silence the oath was put to loyal subjects all over the country who all declared   his grace's title to be just and good!but when it came to the prisoner, he refused!he calls this \"silence \"yet, is there a man in this court   is there a man in this country   who does not know sir thomas more's opinion of this title?yet, how can this be?because this silence betokened   nay, this silence was not silence at all, but most eloquent denial!not so not so, master secretary the maxim of the law is, \"silence gives consent \"if, therefore, you wish to construe what my silence betokened   you must construe that i consented, not that i denied is that in fact what the world construes from it?do you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from it?the world must construe according to its wits this court must construe according to the law my lords, i wish to call sir richard rich!richard rich, come into court richard rich!\"i do swear the evidence i'll give before the court shall be the truth   \"the whole truth, and nothing but the truth \"\"so help me god,\" sir \"so help me god \"now rich, on may 12, you were at the tower?- i was  - for what purpose?i was sent to carry away the prisoner's books - did you talk with the prisoner? - yes did you talk of the king's supremacy of the church?yes what did you say?i said to him, \"supposing there were an act of parliament   \"to say that i, richard rich, were to be king \"would not you, master more, take me for king?\"\"that i would,\" he said \"for then you would be king \"yes?then he said, \"but i will put you a higher case \"how, if there were an act of parliament, to say that god should not be god?\"- this is true and then you said    - silence!continue but then i said, \"i will put you a middle case \"parliament has made our king head of the church \"why will you not accept him?\"well?and then he said, \"parliament had not the power to do it \"repeat the prisoner's words he said:\"parliament had not the competence \"or words to that effect he denied the title!he did in good faith, rich, i am sorrier for your perjury than my peril - do you deny this? - yes!you know if i were a man who heeded not the taking of an oath   i need not be here now, i will take an oath if what master rich has said is true   i pray i may never see god in the face which i would not say, were it otherwise, for anything on earth!- that is not evidence  - is it probable   is it probable that after so long a silence on this   the very point so urgently sought of me   i should open my mind to such a man as that?sir richard, do you wish to modify your testimony?no, my lord is there anything you wish to take away from it?no, my lord have you anything to add?no, my lord - have you, sir thomas? - to what purpose?i am a dead man you have your will of me then the witness may withdraw there is one question i would like to ask the witness that's a chain of office you're wearing  may i see it?the red dragon what's this?sir richard is appointed attorney general for wales for wales why richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world but for wales my lords! i've done the jury will retire and consider the evidence considering the evidence, it shouldn't be necessary for them to retire is it necessary?then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?guilty, my lord!sir thomas more, you have been found guilty of high treason - the sentence of the court    - my lords!when i was practicing the law, the manner was to ask the prisoner   before pronouncing sentence, if he had anything to say have you anything to say?yes since the court has determined to condemn me   god knoweth how   i will now discharge my mind   concerning the indictment and the king's title the indictment is grounded in an act of parliament   which is directly repugnant   to the law of god and his holy church the supreme government of which no temper able person   may by any law presume to take upon him this was granted   by the mouth   of our savior, christ himself   to st  peter and the bishops of rome whilst he lived   and was personally present   here on earth it is therefore insufficient in law   to charge any christian to obey it and more than this   the immunity of the church is promised both in magna carta   and in the king's own coronation oath now, we plainly see you are malicious!not so i am the king's true subject   and i pray for him and all the realm i do none harm i say none harm i think none harm and if this be not enough to keep a man alive   then in good faith, i long not to live nevertheless   it is not for the supremacy that you have sought my blood   but because i would not bend to the marriage!you have been found guilty of high treason the sentence of the court is that you be taken   to the tower of london   until the day hence to the appointment   for your execution!i am commanded by the king to be brief   and since i am the king's obedient subject   brief i will be i die his majesty's good servant   but god's first i forgive you, right readily be not afraid of your office you send me to god you're very sure of that, sir thomas?he will not refuse one who is so blithe to go to him thomas more's head was stuck on traitor's gate for a month then his daughter, margaret, removed it and kept it 'til her death cromwell was beheaded for high treason five years after more the archbishop was burned at the stake the duke of norfolk should have been executed for high treason   but the king died of syphilis the night before richard rich became chancellor of england   and died in his bed "}, {"title": "Driving Miss Daisy", "year": "1989", "rating": "81", "actors": "Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman, Dan Aykroyd, Patti LuPone", "director": "Bruce Beresford", "subtitles": "i'm gone to the market, idella pepsodent's new improved formula cleans teeth whiter than ever are you all right, miss daisy?that's good!you two get back to work -

not easy but that's life tirzah could you help me to my bedroom, please?you spend too much idle time with messala if i didn't, you'd have nothing to complain about \"oh, have mercy on me, world!\"not one of my 359 gods will smile upon me \"don't mock what's wrong with you? it's supposed to be a celebration it's a celebration of your faith, not mine well, that's the virtue of wine  it doesn't discriminate so what happened with you and tirzah?your mother doesn't want us speaking and who cares what mother wants?your mother cares and?- listen, judah, i    - you have feelings for tirzah messala, admit it what am i supposed to do with them?you and your family are royalty and what does that matter?i'd rather she was paying attention to youthan some other brute thanks i'm not saying you're a brute, i'm saying you're brutish oh   simonides, go to bed  messala!- you and tirzah would be like    - like what?like we were family  we're not family, are we?are we?i'm just a lowly orphan your family took in oh, my god  of course we're family!you're my brother  you'll always be my brother everything i own is yours no  i'll never have your name and every time my name is spoken,it will be spoken alongside stories of my grandfather until i earn it back messala, wait  wait!messala - where are you going? - i'm going to rome wait  what do you mean, you're going to rome?messala, stop the emperor's called for men to put down the rebellion in germania he's called for idiots to fight and die i can't believe this after everything we've done for you,you still want to go and fight for those murderers!the pay's steady \"the pay's steady\"?so i can come back to tirzah with stature and wealth but wealth doesn't mean anything - it never does if you're rich  - messala, please look, tell tirzah   if you have something to say to her, say it yourself otherwise you're just walking away judah?where's messala?messala,i hope this letter finds you well, if at all as with all the others i've sent over the past three years,i expect no response i can only hope that it is by your choice and not by the way of your demise i always prefer not to see my food before i eat it that's probably the best idea you would hardly recognize your jerusalem now what? what are you looking at?the circus the romans continue to leave their markand build their circus when you come home, i will honor the monstrosityby humiliating you in one of those chariots you romans so love yes, of course but, brother, i do have news to tell you here, try it two months ago,esther's father found a wealthy roman for her to marry - hmm  - hmm we still have to find you something special oh, no, that's okay  i don't want anything i gave my blessing knowing in my heart it was a mistake i was reminded of how i used to jest to motherthat one day we would wed   go with god    knowing the thought of her son, a prince,marrying a servant would send her to an early grave i couldn't let her go if you leave me, you leave me with nothing she is now my wife, brother despite the wonderful life we have together,rome has come to lay a hard hand on the city repeated attacks have left them with little patience thankfully, we've been able to retain their favor well, for now hear my plea be safe  return home i will listen to stories of your travels judah - what have you found? - i don't know what it is i know what this is! this is a senet board - how much for this? - five shekels a zealot, and that he will be subject todayto the customary punishment of crucifixion - no! - may his punishmentstand as a warning - ah, the zealots  - all they want is freedom and at what cost?if they had their way,they'll bring the whole of rome down on us then where will our freedom be?- how much is it? five? - thank you, my lord there's freedom elsewhere excuse me?love your enemies \"love your enemies \" well, that's very progressive it's the truth god is love  he made us to share that love and where will your love be when the romansturn their anger on the rest of us?hate and fear are lies they turn us against each other those are the lies that make us slaves he has a path planned for you if he has a path planned for me,how am i better off than a slave?why don't you ask her?esther there's truth to what he's saying there must be something better better than what?look around you the roads are lined with the sick and poor we should be grateful we're not one of them - can you spare something, please? - we can be more than grateful esther, i'm not denying the fact that the world is a cruel place but it's our responsibility to take care of ourselvesand the ones we love if people took care of themselves, we'd all be saved if god is righteous, then we should do righteous things if there is a god, then why doesn't he do right by the world?come  follow me follow me  follow me  this way let's go  stay with me who's there?jacob, stop  he's my brother put the knife down put it down judah - what happened to him? - he's wounded - yes, i can see that  how? - the cemetery romans take the stones of our ancestorsto build their circus not anymore - you're zealots! - we fight for your freedom from what i can see, you get young boys injured we need a doctor no, a doctor would inform the centurions go and get a candle  go i need your knife what's your name?- dismas  - dismas i hope you're proud of yourselves you know our aim independence from caesar, ending the occupation of the holy land - by killing romans? - we settle scores not here  not in jerusalem dismas, it's a little bit of pain and then it's done let me see you're a part of this?the man you love is a roman!we don't kill all romans well, that's not very comforting to the dead ones if your father was alive, he would support us you, i don't know, so you can shut your mouth this is your home, this is your land, too they turn our brothers into slavesand that doesn't move you?killing doesn't get us up from under - being passive has done what? - it keeps the peace you confuse peace with freedom jacob the high priests, you in the privileged class   you get caesar's favor in exchange for obedience the rest of us get scraps i won't condone violence nobody's asking your permission you keep my family and my house clean of this now get out - the boy? - he's safe here safer than with you i said get out!you know, mother has hopes for a grandchild she asks me every day  i tell her, \"soon \"but i know \"soon\" isn't soon enough for her that sounds wonderful judah ben-hur?- yes? - follow us where are you taking him?don't worry, we've done nothing wrong it's all right, go inside i've brought the jew i haven't changed that much, have i?you look like one of those statuesyou romans insist on putting everywhere you look like the clay they make them from statues are made of marble, not clay not the one they'd make of you look at this wow well, come on, tell me  tell me everything up mars!move forward!move forward!i'm not sure you want to hear everything and you were right about life as a soldier sleepless nights in the mud  cold and wet drusus, move forward!- if we stay here, we'll die! - then you go!one night in persia   your name?   i met him - your name! - messala severus captain messala severus  these are your men now - start leading! - sir!his name was pontius pilate he gave me a chance he reminded me of what we were fighting for things you and i believe in, judah a civilized world, progress, prosperity, stability i battled and marched through countriesand across continents i'd once dreamed of i led my men from battle to battle, to the heights of glory but we crushed the freedom of innocent civilizationssimply because they were different i saw much blood spilled more than i can describe attention!my true fight became with my commander,marcus why haven't you attacked the city?an attack wasn't needed  my orders were to pacify the city leaving no able-bodied man alive well, who will till the field or harvest   we need to stamp out revolt in every corner of the empire if you want to offer up another lifeless husk- to the empire    - messala severus?we've heard the stories about your grandfather his hand in betraying julius caesar and how he wailed when he was crucified in spite of that, i'm thankful pilate's on my side, brother more thankful to see you me, too to think you were just a lowly hur before you left well, mother missed you every day ah, i'm sorry i left you alone with her tirzah?how is she?tirzah's good, she's well judah, will you tell her   no, you can tell her yourself  she's not yet married my god, you still have it why didn't you write?what would i say?i don't know  that you're alive? that you're well?anything would have sufficed judah,i had to be able to come back on my own terms your family gave me everything i wanted to be able to return the favor now i can mmm  judah, listen - i need your help  - messala you're needed outside  there's been another attack stretcher bearer, over here what's being said about pontius pilate?to be honest, nothing good in a few days, he wants to ride through jerusalemat the head of a legion why?the zealots i've tried to deal with them peacefully  peace doesn't work - so now you try a legion  - that's not my choice all they want from rome is their land back it was never their land  it belonged to you, the wealthy you don't really believe in a return to the age of solomon when the zealots are done with us, they'll turn on you i don't care about their politics  i just care about keeping the peace then we're agreed!look, zealots are the common enemy listen, you're a prince  you have the ear of your people pontius pilate has to ride through jerusalem with no trouble that's all i'm asking brother, i've been away a long time if i come back now, believe me, it's important i want to give you this i've done a lot of work with this it would give me nothing but joyto know it was in your hands and lay forever idle i'll speak to my people, find out what i can thank you - but you must come to dinner  - i will but nothing special  just a simple meal i promise  a simple meal what's this about?there's been an attack at the cemetery  zealots breathing still?this is vilarius  i know him pull him out  brother   lost quite a bit of blood messala what happened, lucius?zealots they poured through the encampment under cover of night we had no way of   the people's gratitude for your bloodless suppression what were your men doing here?orders were to gather stones to build the circus you understand this is sacred land these are judean graves i'm informing pilate if you rule as occupiers, you will be met with disaster, i promise are you as treasonous as you are useless?that's my brother's bow you should be resting i'm fine i need to redress the wound sit well, if you want to call anywhere home again,you'll need to be more careful the people you run with now are trouble i see they've sold you on the romance of fighting,but the reality is very different how would you know?i know when i found you, you were almost dead and for what?so you can say you evened up with the romans?we're not trying to balance anything we want the freedom we were born with and if the romans won't give it to us, we'll have to take it by force how many romans do you even know?have you ever had a conversation with a single one in your life?don't spit your hate for all when you don't even know one now, you're welcome to stay here as long as you need when you're well, you should go back to your family i should but my father was able-bodied, so the romans killed him my mother was fertile, so they did other things to her everybody, just act normal he's coming oh, for god's sake, more normal welcome home this is captain drusus, my second-in-command - greetings  - to you, prince i owe this man my life we have something in common, at least i have a small gift from my travels the finest silk in all of egypt it reminded me of you your return is gift enough for me soyou never got married don't they teach subtlety in caesar's army?you must have a hundred men fighting over you a few but you spoiled me for others - oh, don't say that! - it's true well, you should be happy  you deserve to be i know  i look like a monster nothing like one you know this scar, of course - this one i got in germania  - germania?the other one i can't show you  i   i was run through, i thought fatally, and   as i lay there, i   i wished i could see you again talk to you one last time messala!let me show you something i may kill your brother one day i may kill him first you know, your mother used to interrupt us now you do - we have a lot to catch up on  - indeed it is striking now tell me something honestly  look me in the eyes how many men does it take to get you dressed in the morning?- that's an honest question  - yeah doesn't he look just like zeus?you know, he's twice as fast, though and i knew you'd appreciate him cost me a small fortune he really is a beautiful horse yes, he is so you spoke with your people yes  i spoke to some of the local rabbisand opinion makers, and most of them want peace so who's against us?some local thugs and radicals  no one of any importance right, but who?messala, they don't matter but, judah, if they don't matter, then tell me who they are what are their names?i'm not going to name names so you're going to stand idle,even though you know who the guilty are to be honest, no one's guilty of anything except being sick of rome's oppression are you aware who's riding to this city?did i make that clear?death or peace i've tried every other way and they spit my grandfather's name in my face- and ridicule me! - oh, my god after all these years, you still sound likethat roman orphan who turned up on our doorstep judah, you promised to help me!no, i said i would speak to the people  and i have i don't need you to speak to them  i need you to sway them and if you can't do that,then i need you to tell me who our enemies are because we've run out of time judah, please please, i need you to help me messala, i won't be bullied

better than being alone with my guilt i've filled my life in other ways by serving others?i've found people to care for  people who care for me when i can, i spread the word the message of jesus that carpenter, he showed you kindnesswhen no one else would i've seen him do acts of grace so small,but so much more than other people do every day for five years i asked myself the same questions what happened to you?what happened to my mother and sister?were they crucified?where are they buried?i don't know someone must know messala he's become the pride of roman judea he's the commander of the garrison,races chariots in caesar's name you couldn't go near him you won't go near him get up you can't stay in jerusalem  this isn't the place   no, no, no, i'm safe  i'm staying in a cabin outside the garden gate i will find a way for us if that's what you still want wait to hear from me judah?so, charlatans, religious indoctrinators,holy men we will work with local people we will make arrests anyone who doesn't get the message,we'll find an answer for what's this?a gift brought by a messenger with an invitation to meet - meet where? - he said you would know have no fear of the zealots they fight, they disrupt i haven't changed that much, have i, brother?what do you want?where is my mother and sister?they're dead it was a quick death?where are they buried?you forced my hand, judah you chose the zealots over me listen, judah, your pride   onwards! quickly!surround this house!walk through the portal!coward catch him! do not let him escape!esther faith brought you back to me the same faith that kept you alive that wasn't faith faith wasn't strong enough that was hate i became hate that's what kept me alive let messala go don't you see we've been given a second chance?spend it on hatred, then you're still a slave what else do i have?me you have me messala was down when we entered there was at least one man  he escaped over this balcony were they zealots?i don't know, prefect and at the house of hur you were in uniform an attack on you is an attack on rome an example needs to be made what's the value of a jew to a roman?ten to one twenty, i would say pull twenty jews from the streets execute them in the name of the emperor and let the people know, messala,the days of forgiveness are behind them five, six, seven, eight, nine,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16   what are doing? we've done nothing!- marcus! -    17, 18, 19 i have two!we have 19! take one, leave the other!judah!have you been to the hillside?have you seen the twenty they've crucified?what twenty?there's talk  a roman attacked at the house of hur you did that if people are dead, that's on rome you tried to kill messala i told you to stay away from him, judah  i warned you!i won't let him go unpunished for what he's done to us i can't i watched my father be killed i know what it's like to want to take your feelings out on others they deserve justice for what's happened to them there's nothing here for you anymore nothing know the world you live in, judah the world you live in is rome's their laws their power you cannot fight them in the streets but there is another way the circus in the circus,there is no law there is no right,no wrong what happens there is sport,not vengeance do as you please give them a show, the people will cheer you how pathetic it must be when your sole motivator is greed you feed my beauties don't think you know me five years in the gut of a slave ship i know what motivates five years of pain after twenty of privilege,and now you think you know something about suffering your situation is not unique, judah neither are you my son spoke up for liberation he was branded a rebel dragged through the streets, his throat slit like a hog i traveled my \"all romans must die\" phase,same as you all romans won't die they can't die you can't kill them quickly enough if messala is the pride of rome,take their pride beat him in their circus give them a shame they will understand i was accused i'm meant to be dead they won't let me race they're romans, judah for the right price, they'll let you do anything i bring greetings and congratulationson the opening of your games, prefect this is a private gathering, old man  move on i'm not here to cause trouble same as you, i'm here for the love of sport so, where do i have to go to make a bet?what's the wager?my chariot the entries are long closed three thousand gold pieces that enough to make you reconsider?if that's not enough, how about this?i'll give 3-to-1 odds on all bets my book is open that's very generous against a strong field i'm not betting the field i'm betting that my driver will be victorious overmessala a bet like that's not customary and it's not appropriate not appropriate for who?all of those citizens who stand to gain when you beat my man?you will beat him, won't you?he's just a jew oh, i'm sorry  i failed to mention that but you've crushed an entire people i should think crushing one man wouldn't be difficult you're on soft ground my moneyagainst your pride seems even 3-to-1 not enough? how about 6-to-1?with the agreementthat should my driver cross the line first,any and all claims against him are quit any, and all good i will leave this with youuntil the race is settled african! what's the name of the driver?you know his name judah!shorten those reins!go, go, go!go!step forward!good  steady okay okay good  it will get better i couldn't see anything in the circus,be aware of the drivers' tricks two riders part, suck you in between them,and crush you under their wheels it's called the \"gate \"i just need to get to messala well, you think they're just gonna give it to you?no  the circus is a blood sport,but it is sport there is strategy, and you have to know it good?esther esther, i need to ask something of you there's nothing to speak of i'm going to race messala in the circus it's the only way to end this please you always cared deeply for my family if you ever find their graves,bury us together, put us all to rest judah, you can't give up hope you must believe there's a better way there's not messala rides like the devil he will do whatever he must to win now, when you cut first, they'll tend to put you up on one wheel so, you have to learn how to tilt it's all about balance, judah it's a dangerous maneuver, of course,but with courage and practice, it can be mastered this is the spina this is where i'll be and i will try to guide you now, when the race begins, do not try to take the lead lay back  let the other drivers fight for position - and the best strategy    - but if i'm in the back,how do i get to him?the race will bring him to you with each successive lap,there will be fewer and fewer chariots which is why it's important for you to stay back and remember, judah, first to finish,last to die messala she wants you messala! messala!calm down messala! messala! messala!messala! messala!you can't race him there's no stopping it i'm asking you to remember that judah is your brother the hurs are your family my past is lost to me each one of us has a choice you and judah can make things right how?disqualify him,or, disqualify yourself and be branded as a coward? i'll die first yes, one of you will die there is no victory in this oh, so, you've come to ask for my public humiliation no, messala i've come to tell you of the hell you'll unleash god punishes just as god forgives we have different gods marcus!she's asking for too much judah get up you recognize him?no then he's a thief take him, and give him a thief's reward no, judah ben-hur you don't remember i remember you you never forget a man who's held a knife to your throat i'll kill him!i'll kill him! i swear!drusus  what's happened to you?i know where your family is - my family are dead  - no, they're not he's lying rome doesn't keep prisoners, it executes them pilate ordered your family to be crucified,but i had them intercepted sent to the caves at timnath-serah please, pay me,and i can take you to your family i have to go with him ilderim, you must allow me this i beg you  if there's even a chance they're alive   they are let him up prepare a horse for him i'll be back, i swear - take this  - what for?he's a roman  that's all the reason you need why would you save them?i did it for messala  he cherished your sister if he wouldn't save her himself,then i would save him from his own mistake judah, please, wait mother?oh, my god, you're alive mother, it's me  it's judah it's

like how you said it i mean, it's amazing how is that?salty have you ever considered becoming a food critic?no  not really why? is there money in that?i'm just saying you have a marvelous way with wordswhen describing food \"salty \"so vivid, one can almost taste it hey, i'm just saying it's salty and salt's cheating any cook can make things salty to make it taste good without the salt,with just the other flavors, that's the trick i mean, you take the basic ingredients   we should really get going soon if we expectto get to pittsburgh by dinner hmm  hey, when i was in the army,i knew a guy from pittsburgh except he called it \"titsburgh \"'cause he said all the women there had huge tits that's absurd why would women in pittsburgh have larger breaststhan, say, women in new york?guess

you feel better yes  well, you see, the sky was so blue today   and everything was so green and fragrant i just had to be a part of it and the untersberg kept leading me higher and higher   as though

mountain that led me to you oh?when i was a child, i would come down the mountain   and climb a tree and look over into your garden i'd see the sisters at work, and i'd hear them sing on their way to vespers   which brings me to another transgression, reverend mother i was singing out there today without permission maria, it is only here in the abbey that we have rules about postulants singing i can't seem to stop singing wherever i am and what's worse, i can't seem to stop saying things-everything and anything i think and feel some people would call that honesty but it's terrible, reverend mother you know how sister berthe always makes me kiss the floor after we've had a disagreement?lately i've taken to kissing the floor when i see her coming just to save time maria, when you saw us over the abbey wall   and longed to be one of us   that didn't necessarily mean   that you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?no, mother, but i- i pray, and i try   and i am learning, i really am what is the most important lesson you have learned here, my child?to find out what is the will of god and to do it wholeheartedly maria it seems to be the will of god that you leave us - leave? - only for a while, maria oh, no, mother, please don't do that  don't send me away this is where i belong  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my home, my family it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my life - but are you

expect, mother, and i can do it - i promise i can  - maria yes, mother if it is god's will there is a family near salzburg   that needs a governess until september - until september? - to take care of

well, you can change  we'll wait for you all right captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters i am  thank you, baroness is there a more beautiful expression   of what is good in this country of ours   than the innocent voices of our children?oh, come, now, baron, would you have us believe   that austria alone holds a monopoly on virtue?herr zeller, some of us prefer austrian voices raised in song   to ugly german threats the ostrich buries his head in the sand   and sometimes    in the flag perhaps those who would warn you that the anschluss is coming-and it is coming, captain- perhaps they would get further with you   by setting their words to music if the nazis take over austria, i have no doubt that you will be the entire trumpet section - you flatter me, captain  - oh, how clumsy of me i meant to accuse you it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very kind of you to offer to help me, baroness i'm delighted, maria i really don't think i do have anything that would be appropriate now, where is that lovely little thing   you were wearing the other evening   when the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you?couldn't keep his eyes off me?come, my dear, we are women let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us - here we are  - the captain notices everybody and everything there's no need to feel so defensive, maria you are quite attractive, you know the captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you baroness, i hope you're joking - not at all  - but i've never done a thing to-but you don't have to, my dear there's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him - in love with him? - of course but what makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you but that's not true surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes and, you know, uh, you blushed in his arms   when you were dancing just now don't take it to heart he'll get over it soon enough, i should think  men do, you know then i should go i mustn't stay here - is there something i can do to help? - no, nothing yes please don't say a word about this to the captain no  no, i wouldn't dream of it good-bye, maria i'm sure you'll make a very fine nun champagne, darling i feel like celebrating cheers - you know something? - perhaps then if you're so clever, tell me how to get our little fra\u00e3\u00bclein   to use her influence with georg i want those

befittedto bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdomto be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with naturethat we with wisest sorrow think on him,together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister, and our queen,the imperial jointress to this warlike state,have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,with one auspicious and one dropping eye,with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,in equal scale weighing delight and dole,taken to wife applausenor have we herein barr'dyour better wisdoms, which have freely gonewith this affair along

fail'd to pester us with message,importing the surrender of those landslost by his father, with all bonds of law,to our most valiant brother so much for him thus much the business is we have here writwe have here writto norway, uncle of young fortinbras,that he suppress his nephew's further marchand threatening enterprise against our state and we here dispatch you, good cornelia,and voltimand

hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave i do beseech you, give him leave to go take thy fair hour, laertes - time be thine,and thy best graces spend it at thy will!but now,our cousin hamlet, and our son a little more than kin, and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you?not so, my lord, i am too much i' the sun good hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,and let thine eye look

is common  if it be,why seems it so particular with thee?seems, madam! nay, it is, i know not \"seems\" 'tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,nor customary suits of solemn black,together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,that can denote me truly  these indeed seem,for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth showthese but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature, hamlet,to give these mourning duties to your father but, you must know, your father lost a father,that father lost, lost his, and the survivor, boundin filial obligation for some termto do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolementis a course of impious stubbornness 'tis unmanly grief i pray you, throw to earththis unprevailing woe, and think of usas of a father, for let the world take note,you are the most immediate to our throne,and with no less nobility of lovethan that which dearest father bears his son,do i impart toward you

the winds of heavenvisit her face too roughly  heaven and earth!must i remember?why, she would hang on him,as if increase of appetite had grownby what it fed on and yet, within a month   !let me not think on't frailty, thy name is woman!a little month, or 'ere those shoes were oldwith which she follow'd my poor father's body,like niobe, all tears why she, even she   !o, god! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,would have mourn'd longer married with my uncle my father's brother, but no more like my fatherthan i to hercules within a month 'ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tearshad left the flushing in her galled eyes,she married o, most wicked speed, to postwith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!it is not, nor it cannot come to good but break, my heart, for i must hold my tongue

wittenberg, horatio? marcellus?my good lord  i am very glad to see you  good even, sir but what, in faith, make you from wittenberg?we'll teach you to drink deep 'ere you depart my lord, i came to see your father's funeral i pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student -i think it was to see my mother's wedding indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon  thrift, thrift, horatio!the funeral baked meatsdid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables my father!methinks i see my father where, my lord?in my mind's eye, horatio i saw him once  he was a goodly king he was a man  take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord   i think i saw him yesternight  saw who?my lord, the king your father the king my father!season your admiration with an attent ear, till i may deliver,upon the witness of these gentlemen, this marvel to you for god's love, let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen,marcellus and bernardo, on their watch,in the dead vast and middle of the night,been thus encounter'd a figure like your father,armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,appears before them, and with solemn marchgoes slow and stately by them  this to mein dreadful secrecy impart they did,and i with them the third night kept the watchwhere, as they had deliver'd, the apparition comes i knew your father, these hands are not more like but where was this? my lord, upon the platform where we watch'd did you not speak to it?my lord, i did, but answer made it none  'tis very strange as i do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true and we did think it writ down in our dutyto let you know of it  indeed indeed, sirs, but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight? we do, my lord arm'd, say you? arm'd, my lord  from top to toe?my lord, from head to foot  then saw you not his face?o, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up what look'd he - frowningly?a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red? nay, very pale and fix'd his eyes upon you? most constantly i would i had been there  it would have much amazed you very like, very like stay'd it long?while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred  longer, longer not when i saw't his beard was grizzled?it was, as i have seen it in his life,a sable silver'd i will watch tonight - perchance 'twill walk again i warrant it will if it assume my noble father's person,i'll speak to it, though hell itself should gapeand bid me hold my peace  i pray you all,if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,let it be tenable in your silence still,and whatsoever else shall hap to-night,give it an understanding, but no tongue i will requite your loves so, fare you well upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, i'll visit you all: our duty to your honour my father's spirit in arms! all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come!till then sit still, my soul foul deeds will rise,though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes my necessaries are embark'd farewell and, sister, as the winds give benefitand as convoy is assistant, do not sleep,but let me hear from you do you doubt that?for hamlet and the trifling of his favour,hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,a violet in the youth of primy nature forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute - no more no more but so? think it no more  perhaps he loves you now,and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirchthe virtue of his will  but you must fear,his greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not, as unvalued persons do,carve for himself, for on his choice dependsthe safety and the health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribedunto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you,it fits your wisdom so far to believe itas he in his particular act and placemay give his saying deed - which is no furtherthan the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,if with too credent ear you list his songs distant thumpor lose your heart, or your chaste treasure opento his unmaster'd importunity fear it, ophelia!fear it, my dear sister,and keep you in the rear of your affection,out of the shot and danger of desire be wary, then  best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels, though none else near i shall the effect of this good lesson keep,as watchman to my heart  but, good my brother,do not, as some ungracious pastors do,show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,and recks not his own rede  o, fear me not i stay too long, but here my father comes a double blessing is a double grace, occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here, laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, and you are stay'd for there, my blessing with thee!and these few precepts in thy memorysee thou character  give thy thoughts no tongue,nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainmentof each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade  bewareof entrance to a quarrel, but being in,bear't that the opposed may beware of thee give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,but not express'd in fancy! rich, not gaudy,for the apparel oft proclaims the man neither a borrower nor a lender be, for loan     oft loses both itself and friend   and borrowing      dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine ownself be true,and it must follow, as the night the day,thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee!most humbly do i take my leave, my lord the time invites you - go, your servant tends farewell, ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock'd,and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell door closeswhat is't, ophelia, he hath said to you?so please you, something touching the lord hamlet marry, well bethought 'tis told me, he hath very oft of lategiven private time to you, and you yourselfhave of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so, as so 'tis put on me,and that in way of caution, i must tell you,you do not understand yourself so clearlyas it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you? give me up the truth he hath, my lord, of late made many tendersof his affection to me affection! pah!you speak like a green girl,unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders, as you call them?i do not know, my lord, what i should think marry, i'll teach you  think yourself a baby,that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,which are not sterling  tender yourself more dearly,or, not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,running it thus you'll tender me a fool my lord, he hath importuned me with lovein honourable fashion ay, fashion you may call it - go to, go to and hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay, springes to catch woodcocks  i do know,when the blood burns, how prodigal the soullends the tongue vows  these blazes, daughter,giving more light than heat, extinct in both,you must not take for fire  from this timebe somewhat scanter of your maiden presence,for lord hamlet, believe so much in him, that he is youngand with a larger tether may he walkthan may be given you in few, ophelia, do not believe his vows this is for all i would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,have you so slander any moment leisure,as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to't, i charge you come your ways i shall obey, my lord the air bites shrewdly - it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now? i think it lacks of twelve no, it is struck  indeed? i heard it not then it draws near the seasonwherein the spirit held his wont to walk bangfirework what does this mean, my lord?the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels and, as he drains his draughts of rhenish down,the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray outthe triumph of his pledge  is it a custom?ay, marry, is't but to my mind, though i am native hereand to the manner born, it is a custommore honour'd in the breach than the observance fireworks explodelook, my lord, it comes!angels and ministers of grace defend us!be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd?bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell?be thy intents wicked or charitable,thou comest in such a questionable shapethat i will speak to thee i'll call thee hamlet,king,father,royal dane  o, answer me!let me not burst in ignorance, but tellwhy thy canonised bones, hearsed in death,have burst their cerements  why the sepulchre,wherein we saw thee quietly inter'd,hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,to cast thee up again  what may this mean,that thou, dead corpse, again in complete steelrevisits thus the glimpses of the moon,making night hideous, and we fools of natureso horridly to shake our dispositionwith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?say, why is this?wherefore?what should we do?it beckons you to go away with it,as if it some impartment did desire to you alone it waves you to a more removed ground  but do not go with it no, by no means  it will not speak, then i will follow it do not, my lord  why, what should be the fear?i do not set my life in a pin's fee and for my soul, what can it do to that, being a thing immortal as itself?it waves me forth again, i'll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,or to the dreadful summit of the cliffthat beetles o'er his base into the sea,and there assume some other horrible form,which might deprive your sovereignty of reasonand draw you into madness? it waves me still go on, i'll follow thee  you shall not go, my lord hold off your hands! be ruled - you shall not go my fate cries out,and makes each petty artery in this bodyas hardy as the nemean lion's nerve still am i call'd  unhand me, gentlemen by heaven, i'll make a ghost of him that lets me!i say, away!go on, i'll follow thee he waxes desperate with imagination let's follow - 'tis not

bound to hear so art thou to revenge, when thou dost hear what?i am thy father's spirit,doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,and for the day confined to fast in fires,till the foul crimes done in my days of natureare burned and purged away  but that i am forbidto tell the secrets of my prison-house,i could a tale unfold whose lightest wordwould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young

tell us this why, right, you are i' the right,and so, without more circumstance at all, i hold it fit that we shake hands and part you, as your business and desire shall point you,for every man has business and desires,such as it is, and for mine own poor part,look you, i'll go pray these are but wild and whirling words, my lord i'm sorry they offend you, heartily  yes, 'faith heartily there's no offence, my lord yes, by saint patrick, but there is, horatio,and much offence too touching this vision here,it is an honest ghost, that let me tell youfor your desire to know what is between

lord, we will not nay, but swear it in faith, my lord, not i nor i, my lord, in faith  upon my sword we have sworn, my lord, already  indeed, upon my sword, indeed echoing voice: swear  ah, ha, boy!say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny?come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage -consent to swear  propose the oath, my lord never to speak of this that you have seen, swear by my sword echoing voice: swear!hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground come hither, gentlemen, and lay your hands again upon my sword never to speak of this that you have heard swear by my sword  echoing voice: swear!well said, old mole!canst work i' the earth so fast? a worthy pioneer!once more remove, good friends o day and night, but this is wondrous strange!and therefore as a stranger give it welcome there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio,than are dreamt of in our philosophy  but come!here, as before, never, so help you mercy,how strange or odd soe', er i bear myself,as i perchance hereafter shall think meetto put an antic disposition on,that you, at such times seeing me, never shall,with arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,as \"well, well, we know\",' or \"we could, and if we would\",or such ambiguous giving out, to notethat you know aught of me  this not to do,so grace and mercy at your most need help you - swear!loud echoing voice: swear!we swear! we swear!rest, rest, perturb-ed spirit!so, gentlemen,let us go in together;and still your fingers on your lips, i pray the time is out of joint o cursed spite,that ever i was born to set it right!give my son this money and these notes, reynaldo  i will, my lord you shall do marvellous wisely, good reynaldo,before you visit him, to make inquire of his behaviour my lord, i did intend it marry, well said, very well said  look you, sir,inquire me first what danskers are in paris,and how, and who, what means, and where they keep,what company, at what expense, and findingby this encompassment and drift of questionthat they do know my son, come you more nearer take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of himas thus, \"i know his father and his friends,\"and in part him \" do you mark this, reynaldo?ay, very well, my lord and in part him, but you may say \"not well \"but, if't be he i mean, he's very wild,\"addicted so and so\", and there put on himwhat forgeries you please  marry, none so rankas may dishonour him, take heed of that,but, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slipsas are companions noted and most knownto youth and liberty as gaming, my lord?ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,drabbing - you may go so far my lord, that would dishonour him  faith, no, as you may season it in the charge but, my good lord    wherefore should you do this?ay, my lord, i would know that  marry, sir, here's my drift,and i believe, it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son,as 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, mark you,your party in converse, him you would sound,having ever seen in the prenominate crimesthe youth you breathe of guilty, be assuredhe closes with you in this consequence \"good sir,\" or so, or \"friend\", or \"gentleman\",'according to the phrase or the additionof man and country very good, my lord and then, sir, does he this?he does   what was i about to say?by the mass, i was about to say something where did i leave?at closes in the consequence at closes in the consequence? ay, marry!he closes thus - \"i know the gentleman,\"i saw him yesterday, or t' other day,\"or then, or then, with such, or such,\"and, as you say, there was a' gaming,\"there a falling out at tennis\" or perchance,\"i saw him enter such a house of sale\" -videlicet, a brothel, or so forth  see you now -your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truthand thus do we of wisdom and of reach,by indirections find directions out you have me, have you not? my lord, i have god be wi' you -fare you well  good my lord!observe his inclinations in yourself i shall, my lord  and let him ply his music well, my lord farewell!oh how now, ophelia! what's the matter?o, my lord, my lord, i have been so affrighted!with what, i' the name of god?my lord, as i was sewing in my closet,lord hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,no hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ankle,pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,and with a look so piteous in purportas if he had been loosed out of hellto speak of horrors, he comes before me mad for thy love? my lord, i do not know,but truly, i do fear it  what said he?he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm,and, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,he falls to such perusal of my faceas he would draw it long stay'd he so at last, a little shaking of mine armand thrice his head thus waving up and down,he raised a sigh so piteous and profoundas it did seem to shatter all his bulkand end his being that done, he lets me goand, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,he seem'd to find his way without his eyes for out o' doors he went without their help,and, to the last, bended their light on me come  this is the very ecstasy of love,whose violent property fordoes itselfand leads the will to desperate undertakings i am sorry what, have you given him any hard words of late?no, my good lord, but, as you did command,i did repel his fetters and deniedhis access to me  that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgmenti had not quoted him  i fear'd he did but trifle,and meant to wreck thee, but, beshrew my jealousy!come, go we to the king this must be known welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern!moreover that we much did long to see you,the need we have to use you did provokeour hasty sending  something have you heardof hamlet's transformation  what it should be,more than his father's death, that thus hath put himso much from the understanding of himself,we cannot dream of  i beseech youthat, being of such young days brought up with him,that you vouchsafe your rest here in our courtsome little time so by your companiesto lead him on to pleasures, and to gather,so much as by occasion you may glean,whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,that, open'd, lies within our remedy good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,and sure i am two men there are not livingto whom he more adheres  if it will please youto show us so much gentry and good willas to expend your time with us awhile,for the supply and profit of our hope,your visitation shall receive such thanksas fits a king's remembrance both your majestiesmight, by the sovereign power you have of us,put your dread pleasures more into commandthan to entreaty but we both obey,and here give up ourselves, in the full bentto lay our service freely at your feet, to be commanded thanks, rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks, guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go, some of you, and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our presence and our practisespleasant and helpful to him!ay, amen!the ambassadors from norway, my good lord,are joyfully return'd thou still hast been the father of good news have i, my lord?i assure my good liege, i hold my duty, as i hold my soul,both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think, that i have foundthe very cause of hamlet's lunacy o, speak of that - that do i long to hear first give admittance to the ambassadors -my news shall be the fruit unto the feast thyself do grace to them, and bring them in he tells me, my sweet gertrude, that he hath foundthe head and source of all your son's distemper i doubt it is no other but the main -his father's death,and our o'erhasty marriage we will sift him welcome, good friends!say, what from our brother norway?most fair return of greetings and desires he sent out to suppress his nephew's march the which he thought proposed against the poles,but, better look'd into, he truly foundit was against your highness and our state so fortinbras receives rebuke from himand vows before his uncle never moreto give assay of arms against denmark here ha!it likes us well at night we'll feast together most welcome home!this business is well ended my liege, and madam, to expostulatewhat majesty should be, what duty is,why day is day, night night,and time   is time were nothing but to waste night, day and time therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,i will be brief  your noble son is mad  ah!mad call i it, for, to define true madness,what is't but to be nothing else but mad?but let that go  more matter, with less art madam, i swear i use no art at all that he is mad, 'tis true, 'tis true 'tis pity,and pity 'tis 'tis true, a foolish figure but farewell it, for i will use no art mad let us grant him, then and now remainsthat we find out the cause of this effect,or rather say, the cause of this defect,for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains, and the remainder thus i have a daughter, have while she is minewho, in her duty and obedience, mark,hath given me this now gather, and surmise \"to the celestial and my soul's idol, the most beautified ophelia,\"that's an ill phrase, a vile phrase \"beautified\" is a vile phrase, but you shall hear  thus \"in her excellent white   bosom, these   \"he tuts   etc came this from hamlet to her?good madam, stay awhile, i will be faithful \"doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move,\"doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt i love \"this, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me, and more above but how hath she received his love?what do you think of me?as of a friend, faithful and honourable i would fain prove so  but what might you think,when i had seen this hot love on the wingas i perceived it, i must tell you that,before my daughter told me what might you,or my dear majesty your queen here, think,if i had given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,or look'd upon this love with idle sight?no, i went round to work,and my young mistress thus i did bespeak \"lord hamlet is a prince, out of thy star -\"this must not be \" and then i precepts gave her,that she should lock herself from his resort,admit no messengers, receive no tokens which done, she took the fruits of my advice and he, repulsed, a short tale to makefell into a sadness, then into a fast,thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,into the madness wherein now he raves,and all we mourn for do you think 'tis this?it may be, very likely hath there been such a time i'd fain know thatthat i have positively said 'tis so,when it proved otherwise?not that i know take this from this, if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me, i will findwhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeedwithin the centre how may we try this further?you know, sometimes he walks four hours togetherhere in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i'll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then,mark the encounter  if he love her notand be not from his reason fallen thereon,let me be no assistant for a state, but keep a farm and carters we will try it  but, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes sweet gertrude, leave us her father and myself, lawful espials,thus may of their encounter frankly judge,if be the affliction of his love or nothat thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part, ophelia,i do wishthat your good beauties be the happy causeof hamlet's wildness  so shall i hope your virtueswill bring him to his wonted way again,to both your honours madam, i wish it may ophelia, walk you here read on this book,that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness i hear him coming  let's withdraw, my lord to be, or not to be,that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sufferthe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,or to take arms against a sea of troubles,and by opposing end them?to die,to sleep,no more,and by a sleep to say we endthe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksthat flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation     devoutly to be wish'd to die,to sleep to sleep, perchance to dream ay, there's the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may comewhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,must give us pause there's the respectthat makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time,but that the dread of something after death?the undiscover'd country from whose bournno traveller returns, puzzles the willand makes us rather bear those ills we havethan fly to others that we know not of?thus conscience does make cowards of us all,and thus the native hue of resolutionis sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,and enterprises of great pith and momentwith this regard their currents turn awry,and lose the name of action  soft you now!the fair ophelia!nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remember'd good my lord, how does your honour for this many a day?i humbly thank you - well, well, well my lord, i have remembrances of yoursthat i have long-ed long to re-deliver i pray you, now receive them not i - i never gave you aught mine honour'd lord, you know right well you did,and, with them, words of so sweet breath composedas made the things more rich  their perfume lost,take these again, for to the noble mindrich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there, my lord are you honest?my lord?are you fair? what means your lordship?i did love you, once indeed, my lord, you made me believe so you should not have believed me, i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery  why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?i am myself indifferent honest,and yet i could accuse me of such things it were better my mother had not borne me what should such fellows as i do, crawling between earth and heaven?we are arrant knaves, all - believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where's your father?at home, my lord let the door be shut upon him,that he may play the fool nowhere but in his own house farewell o, help him, you sweet heavens!if thou dost marry, i'll give you this plague for thy dowry -be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery, go, farewell or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool,for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery, go, and quickly too  farewell o heavenly powers, restore him!you jig, you amble, and you lisp,and nick-name god's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance go to, i'll no more on't, it hath made me mad i say, we will have no more marriages those that are married already, all but one, shall live,the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery, go o, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!the courtier's,soldier's,scholar's, eye,tongue, sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state,the glass of fashionand the mould of form,the observed of all observers,quite,quite down!and i,of ladies most deject and wretched,that suck'd the honey of his music vows,now see that noble and most sovereign reason,like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youthblasted with ecstasy o, woe is me,to have seen what i have seen,see what i see!'love! his affections do not that way tend 'there's something in his soul,o'er which his melancholy sits on brood,and i do think the hatch and the disclosewill be some danger how now, ophelia!you need not tell us what lord hamlet said, we heard it all away, i do beseech you, here he comes i'll bore him presently how does my good lord hamlet?well   god a mercy do you know me, my lord?excellent well - you are a fishmonger not i, my lord  then i would you were so honest a man honest, my lord! ay, sir - to be honest, as this world goes,is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that's very true, my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,being a god kissing carrion    have you a daughter?i have, my lord let her not walk in the sun conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive friend, look to 't how say you by that? still harping on my daughter,yet he knew me not at first - he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone, far gone,and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love -very near this  i'll speak to him again what do you read, my lord?words!words, words?what is the matter, my lord?between who?i mean, the matter that you read, my lord slanders, sir, for the satirical rogue says herethat old men have grey beards   that their faces are wrinkled   their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum   and that they have a most plentiful lack of wit   well   together with most weak hams all which, sir, though i most powerfully and potently believe,yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself, sir, should be as old as i am,if like a crab you could go backward though this be madness, yet there is method in 't will you walk out of the air, my lord? into my grave?indeed, that is out o' the air how pregnant sometimes his replies are!my honourable lord, i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot, sir, take from me anythingthat i would more willingly part withalexcept my life,except my life,except my life fare you well, my lord these tedious old fools!you go to seek the lord hamlet - there he is god save you, sir!my honoured lord!my most dear lord!my excellent good friends! how dost thou, guildenstern?ah, rosencrantz! good lads, how do ye both?as the indifferent children of the earth happy, in that we are not over-happy on fortune's cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe? neither, my lord then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?faith, her privates we in the secret parts of fortune?most true, she is a strumpet what's the news? none, my lord,but that the world's grown honest then is doomsday near!but your news is not true  let me question more in particular what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,that she sends you to prison hither?prison, my lord? denmark's a prison then is the world one a goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons,denmark being one o' the worst we think not so, my lord why, then, 'tis none to you,for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so to me it's a prison why then, your ambition makes it one -'tis too narrow for your mind o god,i could be bounded in a nut shelland count myself a king of infinite space,were it not that i have bad dreams shall we to the court? we'll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants but, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at elsinore?to visit you, my lord, no other occasion  were you not sent for?is it your own inclining?a free visitation?come, deal justly with me come, nay, speak! what should we say, my lord?why, anything, but to the purpose you were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks,which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end, my lord?that you must teach me but let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship,be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?what say you? nay, then, i have an eye of you  if you love me, hold not off my lord, we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery,and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have,of late,but wherefore i know not,lost all my mirth,forgone all custom of exercise and indeed it goes so heavily with my dispositionthat this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory,this most excellent canopy, the air,look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament,this majestical roof fretted with golden fire,why, it appears no other thing to methan a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man!how noble in reason!how infinite in faculty!in form and moving, how express and admirable!in action, how like an angel!in apprehension, how like a god!the beauty of the world!the paragon of animals!and yet, to me, what is this     quintessence of dust?man delights not me uh-huh no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then, when i said man delights not me?to think, my lord, if you delight not in man,what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way,and hither are they coming, to offer you service  what players are they?even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me it is not very strange, for mine uncle is king of denmark,and there are those that would make mows at him while my father lived,who'd give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piecefor his picture in little 'sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out car horn there are the players  gentlemen, you are welcome to elsinore come then, your hands my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived in what, my dear lord?i am but mad north-north-west when the wind is southerly, i know an 'awk from an 'andsaw well, be with you, gentlemen!hark you, guildenstern, and you too  at each ear a hearer -that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts happily he's the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players - mark it you say right, sir - monday morning, 'twas so indeed my lord, i have news to tell you my lord, i have news to tell you!when roscius was an actor in rome    the actors are come hither, my lord buzz, buzz! upon mine honour    then came each actor on his arse the best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,scene individable, or poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy, nor plautus too light o jephthah, judge of israel, what a treasure hadst thou!what a treasure had he, my lord?why, \"one fair daughter and no more, the which he loved passing well \"still on my daughter  am i not i' the right, old jephthah?if you call me jephthah, my lord, i have a daughter that i love passing well nay, that follows not what follows, then, my lord? you are welcome, masters, welcome, all i am glad to see thee well  welcome, good friends o, my old friend!what, my young lady and mistress! by'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i last saw you pray god, your voice be not cracked within the ring  we'll have a speech straight come, give us a taste of your quality - come, a passionate speech what speech, my lord?i heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted,or, if it was, not above once, for the play, i remember, pleased not the million 'twas caviare to the general one speech in it i chiefly loved 'twas aeneas' tale to dido,and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of priam's slaughter if it live in your memory, begin at this line let me see, let me see \"the rugged pyrrhus, like the hyrcanian beast,\" - it is not so it begins with pyrrhus, \"the rugged pyrrhus   \"he whose sable arms    \"  whose sable arms\"!er, \"black as his purpose did the night resemble \"when he lay couch-ed in the ominous horse,\"hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\"with

\"old grandsire priam seeks \"so, proceed you fore god, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion ssssh!anon he finds him,striking too short at greeks, his antique sword,rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,repugnant to command  unequal match'd,pyrrhus at priam drives, in rage strikes wide,but with the whiff and wind of his fell swordhis unnerv-ed father falls then senseless ilium,seeming to feel this blow, with flaming topstoops to his base, and with a hideous crashtakes prisoner pyrrhus' ear for, lo! his sword,which was declining on the milky headof reverend priam, seem'd in the air to stick so, as a painted tyrant, pyrrhus stood,and like a neutral to his will and matter,did nothing but, as we often see, against some storm,a silence in the heavens, the rack

cyclops' hammers fallon mars, his armours forged for proof eternewith less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding swordnow falls on priam this is too long it shall to the barber's, with your beard  prithee,

down, threatening the flameswith bisson rheum, a clout about that headwhere late the diadem stood and for a robe, about her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,a blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,'gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her thenwhen she saw pyrrhus make malicious sportin mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,the instant burst of clamour that she made,unless things mortal move them not at all,would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven     and passion in the gods look, where he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes pray you, no more 'tis well i'll have thee speak out the rest soon applausegood my lord, will you see the players well bestowed?do you hear, let them be well used,for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time my lord, i will use them according to their desert god's bodykins, man, much better!use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?come, sirs  follow him, friends we'll hear a play tomorrow dost thou hear me, old friend?can you play the murder of gonzago?ay, my lord  we'll ha't tomorrow night you could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines,which i would set down and insert in't, could you not?ay, my lord  very well follow that lord, and pray you, mock him not er   no my good friends, i'll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord!ay, so, god be wi' ye now i am alone o, what a rogue and peasant slave am i!is it not monstrous that this player here,but in a fiction,in a dream of passion,could force his soul so to his own conceitthat from her workings all his visage wann'd,tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,a broken voice, and his whole function suitingwith forms to his conceit?and all for nothing!for hecuba!what's hecuba to him, or he to hecuba,that he should weep for her?what would he do,had he the motive and the cue for passionthat i have? he would drown the stage in tearsand cleave the general ear with horrid speech,make mad the guilty and appal the free,confound the ignorant, and amaze indeedthe very faculties of eyes and ears  yet i,a dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,like john a'dreams,unpregnant of my cause, and can say nothing no, not for a king,upon whose property and most dear lifea damn'd defeat was made am i a coward?who calls me villain?breaks my pate across?plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?tweaks me by the nose?gives me the lie i' the throat, as deep as to the lungs? who does me this? ha!'swounds, i should take it, for it cannot bebut i am pigeon-liver'd and lack gallto make oppression bitter, or ere thisi should have fatted all the region kiteswith this slave's offal bloody, bawdy villain!remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!o, vengeance!why, what an ass am i!this is most brave,that i, the son of a dear father,murder'd,prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,and fall a-cursing, like a very drab,a scullion! fie upon't! foh!about, my brain!i have heardthat guilty creatures sitting at a playhave by the very cunning of the scenebeen struck so to the soul that presentlythey have proclaim'd their malefactions for murder, though it have no tongue, will speakwith most miraculous organ i'll have these playersplay something like the murder of my fatherbefore mine uncle i'll observe his looks, i'll tent him to the quick if he but blench,i know my course the spirit that i have seenmay be a devil and the devil hath powerto assume a pleasing shape  yea, and perhapsout of my weakness and my melancholy,as he is very potent with such spirits, abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds more relative than this the play's the thingwherein i'll catch the conscience of the king and can you, by no drift of conference,get from him why he puts on this confusion?he does confess he feels himself distracted,but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded,but, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well?most like a gentleman  but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question, but, of our demands, most free in his reply did you assay him? to any pastime?madam, it so fell out, that certain playerswe o'er-raught on the way, of these we told him,and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it  'tis most true and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart, and it doth much content meto hear him thus inclined good gentlemen, give him a further edge, and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall, my lord i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england haply the seas and countries differentwith variable objects will expelthis something-settled matter in his heart,whereon his brains still beating puts him thusfrom fashion of himself  what think you on't?it shall do well, but yet do i believethe origin and commencement of his griefsprung from neglected love my lord, do as you please,but, if you hold it fit, after the playlet his queen mother all alone entreat himto show his grief  let her be round with him,and i'll be placed, so please you, in the earof all their conference  if she find him not,to england send him, or confine him whereyour wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go speak the speech, i pray you, as i pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue,but if you mouth it, as many of your players do,i had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hands, thus,but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest,and, as i may say, the whirlwind of passion,you must acquire and beget a temperancethat may give it smoothness o, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters,to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it out-herods herod  pray you, avoid it i warrant your honour be not too tame neither,but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word, the word to the action with this special observance,that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end,both at the first and last, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature,to show virtue her own feature,scorn her own image,and the very age and body of the timeis form and pressure now this overdone, or come tardy off,though it make the unskilful laugh,cannot but make the judicious grieve,the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir o, reform it altogether and let those that play your clownsspeak no more than is set down for them,for there be of them that will themselves laugh,to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too,though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go,

dear my lord he coughso, my offence is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upon't -a brother's murder pray can i not,though inclination be as sharp as will -my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and, like a man to double business bound,i stand in pause where i shall first begin,and both neglect what if this curs-ed handwere thicker than itself with brother's blood?is there not rain enough in the sweet heavensto wash it white as snow?whereto serves mercybut to confront the visage of offence?and what's in prayer but this two-fold forceto be forestalled ere we come to fall,or pardon'd, being down?then i'll look up my fault is past but, o, what form of prayercan serve my turn? \"forgive me my foul murder?\"that cannot be, since i am still possess'dof those effects for which i did the murder -my crown, mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardon'd and retain the offence?in the corrupted currents of this world,offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itselfbuys out the law, but 'tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action liesin his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,to give in evidence what then?what rests?try what repentance can o   what can it not?but what can it, when one cannot repent?o wretched state!o bosom black as death!o lime-ed soul, that, struggling to be free,art more engaged!help, angels!make assay!bow, stubborn knees,and heart with strings of steel,be soft as sinews of the newborn babe all may yet be well he mouthsnow might i do it pat,now he is praying and now i'll do't!and so he goes to heaven,and so am i revenged  that would be scann'd a villain kills my father, and for that,i, his sole son, do this same villain send to heaven?o, this is hire and salary, not revenge he took my father grossly, full of bread,with all his crimes broad blown, as flush as may and how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?am i then revenged,to take him in the purging of his soul,when he is fit and season'd for his passage?no!up, blade,and know thou a more horrid hent,when he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed,at gaming, swearing, or about some actthat has no relish of salvation in't then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,and that his soul may be as damn'd and blackas hell, whereto it goes my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days my words fly up,my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go he will come straight  look you, lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,and that your grace hath screen'd and stood betweenmuch heat and him  i'll silence me even here pray you, be round with him  knock at doori'll warrant you, fear me not  withdraw, i hear him coming mother! mother!mother!now, mother, what's the matter?hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended mother, you have my father much offended come, come, you answer with an idle tongue go, go, you question with a wicked tongue  why, how now, hamlet!what's the matter now?have you forgot me?no, by the rood, not so you are the queen, your husband's brother's wife,and - would it were not so! -you are my mother nay, then, i'll set those to you that can speak come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge you go not till i set you up a glasswhere you may see the inmost part of you what wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me!help, help, ho!what, ho! help, help, help! how now!a rat? dead, for a ducat, dead!gunshotwhat hast thou done?nay, i know not  is it the king?o, what a rash and bloody deed is this!a bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,as kill a king, and marry with his brother as kill a king!ay, lady, 'twas my word thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!i took thee for thy better  take thy fortune leave wringing of your hands  peace! sit you down,and let me wring your heart, for so i shall,if it be made of penetrable stuff what have i done, that thou darest wag thy tonguein noise so rude against me? such an actthat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,calls virtue hypocrite, makes marriage-vowsas false as dicers' oaths  ay me, what act,that roars so loud, and thunders in the index?look here, upon this picture,and   on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers see, what a grace was seated on this brow hyperion's curls,the front of jove himself an eye like mars, to threaten and command a station like the herald mercurynew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,a combination and a form indeed,where every god did seem to set his seal,to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband look you now, what follows here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear,blasting his wholesome brother  have you eyes?could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,and batten on this moor? ha! have you eyes?you cannot call it love, for at your agethe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,and waits upon the judgement and what judgementwould step from this to this? what devil was'tthat thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,or but a sickly part of one true sensecould not so mope o shame! where is thy blush?o hamlet, speak no more thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grain-ed spotsas will not leave their tinct nay, but to livein the rank sweat of an enseam-ed bed,stew'd in corruption, honeying and making loveover the nasty sty  o, speak to me no more!these words, like daggers, enter in mine ears no more, sweet hamlet!a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the titheof your precedent lord  a vice of kings,a cutpurse of the empire and the rule,who from a shelf the precious diadem stole,and put it in his pocket! no more!a king of shreds and patches  clock chimessave me, and hover o'er me with your wings,you heavenly guards!what would your gracious figure? alas, he's mad!do you not come your tardy son to chide,that, lapsed in time and passion, lets go bythe important acting of your dread command?o, say!do not forget this visitationis but to whet thy almost blunted purpose but, look, amazement on thy mother sits o, step between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works speak to her, hamlet how is it with you, lady?alas, how is't with you,that you do bend your eye on vacancyand with the incorporal air do hold discourse?forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep o gentle son, upon the heat and flame of thy distempersprinkle cool patience  whereon do you look?on him, on him! look you! how pale he glares!do not look upon me,lest with this piteous action you convertmy stern effects  then what i have to dowill want true colour, tears perchance for blood to whom do you speak this?do you see nothing there?nothing at all, yet all there is i see  nor did you nothing hear?no, nothing but ourselves why, look you now! look, how it steals away!my father, in his habit as he lived!look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!this is the very coinage of your brain this bodiless creation ecstasyis very cunning in ecstasy! my pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,and makes as healthful music  it is not madnessthat i have utter'd  bring me to the test,i the matter will re-word, which madness would gambol from mother, for love of grace,lay not that flattering unction to your soul,that not your trespass, but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place,whilst rank corruption, mining all within,infects unseen  confess yourself to heaven,repent what's past, avoid what is to come,and do not spread the compost on the weedsto make them ranker o hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain o, throw away the worser part of it,and live the purer with the other half good night,but go not to mine uncle's bed assume a virtue, if you have it not refrain tonight, and that shall lend a kind of easinessto the next abstinence once more, good night and when you are desirous to be bless'd,i'll blessing beg of you for this same lord,i do repent,but heaven hath pleased it so,to punish me with this and this with me,that i must be their scourge and minister i will bestow him,and will answer well the death i gave him so, again, good night i must be cruel, only to be kind thus bad beginsand worse remains behind one more word, good lady  what shall i do?not this, by no means, that i bid you do let the bloat king tempt you again to bed,pinch wanton on your cheeks, call you his mouse and let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,make you to ravel all this matter out,that i essentially

hearing something stir,whips out his weapon, cries, \"a rat, a rat!\"and, in this brainish apprehension,kills the unseen good old man o, heavy deed!it had been so with us, had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all to you yourself, to us,to every one alas, how will this bloody deed be answer'd?it will be laid to us,whose providence should have kept short,restrain'd and out of haunt, this mad young man but so much was our love, we could not understand what was most fit but, like the owner of a foul disease,to keep it from divulging, let it feed,even on the pith of life where is he gone? to draw apart the body he hath kill'd,o'er whom his madness weeps for what is done o gertrude, come! the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must, with all our majesty and skill,both countenance and excuse guildenstern!friends both, go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain,and from his mother's

besides, to be demanded of a sponge!what replication should be made by the son of a king?take you me for a sponge, my lord?ay, sir,that soaks up the king's countenance,his rewards, his authorities but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them,like an ape, an apple in the corner of his jaw first mouthed,to be last swallowedwhen he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you,and, sponge, you shall be dry again i understand you not, my lord i am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear my lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king the body is with the king, but the king is not with the body the king is a thing a thing, my lord! of nothing bring me to him hide fox, and all after i have sent to seek him, and to find the body how dangerous is it that this man goes loose!yet must not we put the strong law on him he's loved of the distracted multitude,who like not in their judgment, but their eyes and where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,but never the offence to bear all smooth and even,this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate cause diseases desperate grown by desperate measure are relieved,or

you?against some part of poland who commands them, sir?the nephew to old norway, fortinbras goes it against the main of poland, sir, or for some frontier?truly to speak, and with no addition, we go to gain a little patchof ground that hath in it no profit but the name to pay five ducats, five, i would not farm it why, then the polack never will defend it yes, it is already garrison'd two thousand souls and 20,000 ducats will not debate the question of this straw i humbly thank you, sir god be wi' you, sir how all occasions do inform against me,and spur my dull revenge i do not know why yet i

prince,whose spirit with divine ambition puff'dmakes mouths at the invisible event,exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune,death and danger dare,even for an egg-shell o, from this time forth,my thoughts be bloody,or be nothing worth!laertes, was your father dear to you?or are you but the painting of a sorrow, a face without a heart?why ask you this?hamlet comes back what will you undertake,to prove yourself your father's son in deed more than in words?to cut his throat i' the church no place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize,revenge should know no bounds but, good laertes, will you do this, stay close within your chamber hamlet return'd shall know you are come home we'll set on those who'll praise your excellence,and for your rapier most especially, bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he, being remiss, and free from all contriving,will not peruse the foils, so that,with ease, or a little shuffling,you may choose a sword unblunted,and in a pass of practise requite him for your father i will do it and, for that purpose, i'll anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebankso mortal that, but dip a knife in it,where it draws blood no cataplasm so rarecan save the thing from death that's scratch'd withal i'll touch my point with this contagion, that, if i but gall him slightly, it may be his death hm  let's further think on this if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance,'twere better not assay'd therefore this plot should have a back or second, that might hold, if this did blast in proof soft!i ha't when in your motion you are hot and dry - as make your bout more violent to that end -and that he calls for drink,i'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,if, by chance, he

willowgrows aslant a brook,that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream there with fantastic garlands did she comeof crow-flowers, nettles,daisies, and long purples - that liberal shepherds give a grosser name -but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them there, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang,an envious sliver broke,when down her weedy trophies and herselffell in the weeping brook her clothesspread wide, and,mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,as one incapable of her own distress,or like a creature native and indued unto that element,but long it could not betill that her garments, heavy with their drink,pull'd the poor wretch from hermelodious layto muddy death  alas, then, she is drown'd?drown'd drown'd too much of water hast thou, poor ophelia,and therefore,i forbid my tears, but yet   it is our trick,nature her custom holds, let shame say what it will  adieu, my lord i have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,but that this folly douses it let's follow, gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage now fear i this will give it start again is she to be buried in christian burialthat wilfully seeks her own salvation?i tell thee, she is and, therefore, make her grave straight well, how can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?why, 'tis found so it must be se offendendo,it cannot be else  for here lies the point if i drown myself wittingly, it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is, to act, to do, to perform argal, she drowned herself wittingly nay, but hear you, goodman delver  give me leave  here lies the water, good here stands the man, good if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes, mark you that but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life cudgel thy brains no more about it go, get thee to yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor # in youth, when i did love, did love# methought it was very sweet    #has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?custom hath made it in him a property of easiness  tis e'en so that skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder!it might be the pate of a politician,one that would circumvent god, might it not? it might, my lord and now my lady worm's,chapless,and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade here's fine revolution, an' we had the trick to see't there's another why, may not that be the skull of a lawyer?where be his quiddities now,his quillets, his tricks?why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel,and will not tell him of his action of battery? eh?i'll speak to this fellow whose grave's this, sirrah?mine, sir # o, a pit of clay for to be made# for such a guest is meet    #i think it be thine, indeed, for thou liest in't thou lie out of it, sir, and therefore it is not yours for my part, i do not lie in't, and yet it is mine thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine 'tis for the dead, not for the quick, therefore thou liest tis a quick lie, sir, 'twill away gain, from me to you what man dost thou dig it for?for no man, sir what woman, then?for none, neither who is to be buried in't?one that was a woman, sir, but, rest her soul, she's dead how absolute the knave is!how long hast thou been a grave-maker?of all the days i' the year, i came to't that day that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras how long is that since?cannot you tell that?every fool can tell that it was the very day that young hamlet was born, he that is mad, and sent into england ay, marry, why was he sent into england?why, because he was mad he shall recover his wits there, or, if he do not, it's no great matter there  why?'twill, a not be seen in him there  there the men are as mad as he how came he mad? very strangely, they say how strangely? faith, e'en with losing his wits upon what ground? why, here in denmark i have been sexton here, man and boy, 30 years how long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?i' faith, if he be not rotten before he die -as we have many pocky corpses now a days,that will scarce hold the laying in -he will last you some eight year or nine year a tanner will last you nine year why he more than another?why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade,that he will keep out water a great while,and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body here's a skull, sir i've lain you in the earththree and 20 years  whose was it?a whoreson mad fellow, he was  whose do you think it was?nay, i know not a pestilence on him for a mad rogue!he poured a flagon of rhenish on my head once this same skull, sir, was yorick's skull, the king's jester this? e'en that  let me see alas, poor yorick!i knew him, horatio a fellow of infinite jest,of most excellent fancy  he hath borne me on his back a thousand times,and now,how abhorred in my imagination it is!my gorge rises at it here hung those lips that i have kissedi know not how oft where be your gibes now?your gambols? your songs?your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar?not one now, to mock your own grinning quite chap-fallen now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her,let her paint an inch thick,to this favour she must come make her laugh at that prithee, horatio, tell me one thing what's that, my lord?dost thou think alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth? e'en so and smelt so? whoo! e'en so, my lord imperious caesar,dead and turn'd to clay,might stop a hole to keep the wind away 'twere to consider too curiously to consider so not a jot bells chimehere comes the king the queen, the courtiers  who is this they follow?and with such maimed rites this doth betokenthe corse they follow did, with desperate hand, foredo its own life 'twas of some estate couch we awhile, and mark what ceremony else? that is laertes what ceremony else?her obsequies have been as far enlarged as we have warranty her death was doubtful and, but that great command o'ersways the order,she should in ground unsanctified have lodged till the last trumpet must there no more be done? no more be done we should profane the service of the deadto sing a requiem and such rest to her as to peace-parted souls lay her i' the earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring!i tell thee, churlish priest,a ministering angel shall my sister be, when thou liest howling what, the fair ophelia!sweets to the sweet farewell!i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet's wife i thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,not have strew'd thy grave o, treble woe, fall ten times treble on that cursed head,whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,till of this flat a mountain you have made,to o'ertop old pelion, or the skyish head of blue olympus what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis?whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars,and makes them stand like wonder-wounded hearers?this is i,hamlet the dane  the devil take thy soul!thou pray'st not well  i prithee, take thy fingers from my throat for, though i am not splenitive and rash, yet have i something in me dangerous,which let thy wiseness fear  hold off thy hand!pluck them asunder  hamlet, hamlet! gentlemen  good my lord, be quiet why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag o my son, what theme?i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not, with all their quantity of love,make up my sum  what wilt thou do for her?o, he is mad, laertes for love of god, forbear him swounds, show me what thou'lt do  woo't weep?woo't fight? woo't fast?woo't tear thyself?woo't drink up eisel?eat a crocodile? i'll do't dost thou come here to whine?to outface me with leaping in her grave?be buried quick with her, and so will i and, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw millions of acres on us,till our ground, singeing his pateagainst the burning zone, make ossa like a wart!nay, an thou'lt mouth, i'll rant as well as thou this is mere madness  and thus awhile the fit will work on him anon, his silence will sit drooping hear you, sir what is the reason that you use me thus?i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may,the cat will mewand dog will have his day good horatio, wait upon him strengthen your patience in our last night's speech we'll put the matter to the present push good gertrude,set some watch over your son there's a divinity that shapes our ends,rough-hew them how we will that is most certain rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead why, man, they did make love to this employment, they are not near my conscience why, what a king is this! does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon?he that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,popp'd in between the election and my hopes,thrown out his angle for my proper life,and with such cozenage is't not perfect conscience, to quit him with this arm?but i am very sorry, good horatio, that to laertes i forgot myself for, by the image of my cause, i see the portraiture of his i'll court his favours but, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion peace! who comes here? your lordship is right welcome back to denmark i humbly thank you, sir dost know this water-fly? no, my lord thy state is the more gracious, for 'tis a vice to know him 'tis a chough sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, i should impart a thing to you from his majesty i will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use, 'tis for the head i thank your lordship, it is very hot no, believe me, 'tis very cold  the wind is northerly it is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion exceedingly, my lord, it is very sultry, as 'twere, i cannot tell how but, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir, this is the matter  i beseech you, remember nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith sir, here is newly come to court laertes,believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences,of very soft society and great showing indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry,for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see the concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?sir? what imports the nomination of this gentleman?of laertes? of him, sir i know you are not ignorant i would you did, sir  yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me  well, sir?you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is i dare not confess that, lest i should compare with him in excellence, but, to know a man well,were to know himself i mean, sir, for his weapon  but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed what's his weapon? rapier and dagger that's two of his weapons but, well the king, sir, hath wagered with him six barbary horses against the which he has imponed,as i take it, six french rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts,most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit what call you the carriages?the carriages, sir, are the hangers but, on  why is this \"imponed\", as you call it?the king, sir, hath laid,that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer how if i answer no?i mean, sir, the opposition of your person in trial sir, i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty 'tis the breathing time of day with me, i will win for him an i can,if not, i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits shall i re-deliver you e'en so?to this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will i commend my duty to your lordship yours, yours this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head he did comply with his mother's dug, before he sucked it you will lose this wager, my lord i do not think so  since he went into france, i have been in continual practise i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart but it is no matter  nay, good my lord it is but foolery  if your mind dislike any thing, obey it i will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit not a whit we defy augury there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now, 'tis not to come if it be not to come, it will be now if it be not now,yet it will come the readiness is all come, hamlet, come, and take this hand from me give me your pardon, sir  i've done you wrong but pardon't, as you are a gentleman this presence knows, and you must needs have heard,how i am punish'd with sore distraction what i have done, that might your nature, honour and exception roughly awake, i here proclaim was madness sir, in this audience, let my disclaiming from a purposed evilfree me so far in your most generous thoughts,that i have shot mine arrow o'er the house, and hurt my brother i am satisfied i do receive your offer'd love like love, and will not wrong it i do embrace it freely and will this brother's wager frankly play  give us the foils  come on  come, one for me i'll be your foil, laertes, in mine ignorance your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, stick fiery off indeed you mock me, sir no, by this hand give them the foils, young osric cousin hamlet, you know the wager?very well, my lord  your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side i do not think it  i have seen you both but since he is better'd, we have therefore odds this is too heavy, let me see another this likes me well enough these foils have all a length? ay, my good lord if hamlet give the first or second hit,or quit in answer of the third exchange,let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw,richer than that which four successive kings in denmark's crown have worn applauselet the kettle to the trumpet speak, the trumpet to the cannoneer without,the cannon to the heavens, the heavens to earth, now the king drinks to hamlet  come, begin and you, the judge, bear a wary eye come on, sir  come, my lord  no, judgment!a hit, a very palpable hit well, again  stay  give me the drink hamlet, this pearl is thine here's to thy health give him the cup i'll play this bout first, set it by awhile another hit - what say you? a touch, a touch, i do confess  our son shall win he's hot, and scant of breath here, hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows  the queen carouses to thy fortune, hamlet good madam! gertrude,do not drink i will, my lord i pray you, pardon me it is the poison'd cup it is too late  i dare not drink yet, madam, by and by come, let me wipe thy face my lord, i'll hit him now  i do not think't and yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience come, for the third, laertes, you but dally i pray you, pass with your best violence  i am afeard you make a wanton of me say you so? come on nothing, neither way have at you now!nay, come, again my lord! my lord!my lord! my lord, my lord!they bleed on both sides  how is it, my lord? how is't, laertes?why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, osric, i am justly kill'd with mine own treachery how does the queen? she swounds to see them bleed no, no, the drink, the drink o, my dear hamlet the drink, the drink!i am poison'd o villany!how?let the door be lock'd  treachery! seek it out it is here, hamlet hamlet, thou art slain no medicine in the world can do thee good, in thee there is not half an hour of life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unblunted and envenom'd the foul practise hath turn'd itself on me lo, here

years of memory memory strange that the mind will forget so much of what only this moment has passedand yet hold clear and bright the memory of what happened years ago,of men and women long since dead yet who shall say what is real and what is not?can i believe my friends all gonewhen their voices are still a glory in my ears?no, and i will stand to say no and no again,for they remain a living truth within my mind there is no fence nor hedge 'round time that is gone you can go back and have what you like of itif you can remember so i can close my eyes on my valley as it is today,and it is gone, and i see it as it was when i was a boy green it was and possessed of the plenty of the earth in all wales, there was none so beautiful everything i ever learnt as a small boy came from my father,and i never found anything he ever told me to be wrong or worthless the simple lessons he taught me are as sharp and clear in my mindas if i had heard them only yesterday in those days, the black slag, the waste of the coal pits,had only begun to cover the side of our hill,not yet enough to mar the countrysidenor blacken the beauty of our village,for the colliery had only begunto poke

sight is in the eye [whistle blows][singing in welsh]then came the scrubbing out in the back yard it was the duty of my sister angharadto bring the buckets of hot water and cold,and i performed what little tasks i could,as my father and brothers scrubbed the coal dust from their backs most would come off them, but some would stay for life this is the honorable badge of the coal miner,and i envied it on my father and grown-up brothers scrub and scrub,mr  coal would lie there and laugh at you aah!oh!there was always a baron of beefor a shoulder or leg of lamb before my father there was never any talk while we were eating i never met anybody whose talk was better than good food my mother was always on the run,always the last to start her dinner and the first to finish,for if my father was the head of our house, my mother was its heart after dinner, when dishes had been washed,the box was brought to the tablefor the spending money to be handed out no one in our valley had ever seen a bank we kept our savings on the mantelpiece my father used to say that money was made to be spent,just as men spend their strength and brains in earning it,and as willingly,but always with a purpose thank

they'll need you today 22 weeks the men were out, as the strike moved into winter it was strange to go out into the streetand find the men there in the daytime it had a feeling of fright in it,and

what the doctor said?yes, sir and you believed it?yes, sir you want to walk again, don't you?yes, sir then you must have faith,and if you have, you will walk againno matter what all the doctors say but he said nature must take her course \"nature is the handmaiden of the lord \"i remember one or two occasionswhen she was given orders to change her course you know your scriptures, boy yes, sir then you know that what's been done beforecan be done again, for you do you believe me, huw?yes, sir good you will see the first daffodil out on the mountain will you?indeed i will, sir then you will i could almost wishthat i were lying there in your place,if it meant reading this book again for the first time treasure island mr  gruffydd?i couldn't let you go without thanking you it was only my duty, girl no  it was more than duty yes, huw's a fine boy, and you're a fine family um, you'd better be going in now  you'll catch your death yes will you be coming to supper soon?uh, yes, later,when you're finished with doctors and such, huh?i will hurry them away, then good \"squire trelawney, dr  livesey,\"and the rest of these gentlemen,having asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure islandfrom the beginning to the end,keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island,and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted,i take up my pen in the year of grace 1785,and go back to the timewhen my father kept the admiral benbow inn   \"all the noble books which have lived in my mind ever since,and always i hoped and kept my faith for the first months,my mother was still upstairs,and we could talk to each other with tappings [chirp][huw whistling][cackling]spring?there you are, girl easy there you are wait it's the old snow got into it [singing in welsh]oh, gwilym there is a wife you have,resting in her bed and letting strangers care for her family there is a wife i have, then go along with you, boy [singing in welsh]will you say something, mother?go on  say something but what    what'll i say?you found plenty to say the last time you spoke it should be easier now, with friends well   well, come and eat, everyone smoke is it, boys lanto i haven't seen you in chapel lately i have been too busy what business, may i ask?mine only asking a civil question, i was and having a civil answer i have been busy with the union unions are the work of the devil you will come to no good end at least i am not sitting on it, talking rubbish in chapel look here    oh, leave it,or i'll say something to be sorry this is a matter that requires airing lanto, why do you think we at the chapel talk rubbish?my remark was not aimed at you then aim it very well because you make yourselves out to be shepherds of the flock,and yet you allow your sheep to live in filth and poverty,and if they try and raise their voices against it,you calm them by telling them their suffering is the will of god sheep, indeed are we sheep to be herded and sheared by a handful of owners?i was taught man was made in the image of god, not a sheep i haven't expressed my views around herebecause i haven't had any wish to interfere in a family disagreement you have my permission to speak very well, then  here is what i think first, have your union you need it alone, you are weak  together, you're strong but remember that with strength goes responsibility,to others and yourselves,for you cannot conquer injustice with more injustice,only with justice and the help of god are you coming outside your position in life, mr  gruffydd?your business is spiritual my business is anything that comes between man and the spirit of god the deacons shall hear that you've been preaching socialism!mr  parry!loose the old devil's teeth!he is our guest!beth, a pint of home brew for mr  parry i'll give him a clout with a frying pan!oh!miss jenkins! a sweet song! the harp, is it?come on, men  get in here now, look  a little song   angharad mr  gruffydd, will we always be in your debt,now you have made us a family again?here  let me oh, your hands there's a pity no matter have you ever been down the collieries?10 years 10 years?while i was studying a bit of soap now oh, don't bother, please there's a man for you, spoiling his good handkerchief look, now, you are king in the chapel,but i will be queen in my own kitchen you will be queen wherever you walk what does that mean?i should not have said it why?i have no right to speak to you so mr  gruffydd?if the right is mine to give,you have it [horn blowing]then the strike was settled,with the help of mr  gruffydd and my father work again,work to wipe out the memory of idleness and hardship the men were happy going up the hill that morning 1 and 9  1 and 9 1 and 10![horn blowing]but not all of them,for there

better than willie he get you a title fight or did he just bust you out,banging your head against other people's fists until you lost your eye?i had my shot i went out swinging and no man can say i didn't yeah, well, i remember  and excuse me if i didn't want my fighterspending the second half of his life cleaning up other people's spit yeah right right  you're the smart one you're the one learning greek it's gaelic well, you just protected yourself out of a championship fight how do you say that in gaelic?sorry thanks boxing is an unnatural act,cos everything in it is backwards you want to move to the left,you don't step left you push on the right toe to move right you use your left toe instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do,you step into it oh my god! he hits the champ with a right hand and the champ's down!ladies and gentlemen, the ref has ended the count and big willie jones is the new champion of the world!it's unbelievable how this has taken place

closed the door  i had to walk back two miles your conscience got the better of you, that's what hmm what the hell's that?it's her birthday you're not breathing right  that's why you're panting so, it's your birthday, huh?how old does that make you?i'm 32, mr  dunn    and i'm here celebrating the factthat i spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing, what i've been doing since 13 and according to you, i'll be 37 'fore i can even throw a decent punch   which after working this speed bag for a month and getting nowhere,i now realize may be god's simple truth other truth is, my brother's in prison,my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her babies is still alive,my daddy's dead, and my mama weighs 312 pounds if i was thinking straight, i'd go back home,find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some oreos the problem is, this is the only thing i ever felt good doing if i'm too old for this, then i got nothing that enough truth to suit you?this your speed bag?put yours behind the counter  wish i could say i wore it out ok just hold it, hold it i'll show you a few things, and then we'll get you a trainer no  sorry - you're in a position to negotiate? - yes, sir,because i know if you train me right, i'm going to be a champ i seen you looking at me yeah, out of pity don't you say that!don't you say that if it ain't true!i want a trainer i don't want charityand i don't want favors if you're not interested, then i got more celebrating to do stop, stop, stop goddamn it, stop what the hell are you doing?ok if i'm going to take you on   you won't never regret it look, just listen to me - if i take you on    - i promise i'll work so hard god, this is a mistake already mm-mm  i'm listening, boss if i take you on, you don't say anything you don't question me you don't ask why, you don't say anything except maybe, \"yes, frankie  \"and i'm going to try to forget the fact that you're a girl it's all i ask and don't come crying to me if you get hurt - all righty  - we got a deal no, not quite i'm going to teach you how to fight then, we'll get you a manager, and i'm off down the road i hate to argue with you, but   don't argue, it's the only way we're doing it i teach you all you need to know, and then you go off and make a million dollars i don't care you get your teeth knocked out, i don't care i don't want to hear about it either way, that's how it is  it's the only way i'll do it all right now, one of the things i've noticed around the gym is, you never move your feet you stand there just flatfooted  you've got to move your feet that's one of the best things i'm going to be able to teach you so, here's what you do  you get yourself   bend your knees a little bit get in an athletic position look like you're going to hit something - move 'em how boss? - uh, just, you go hit the bag - stop  - what'd i do wrong?ok, you did two things wrong one is you asked a question, and two is you asked another question now, what i want you to do   it's not about hitting it hard it's how good you hit it so, watch me and you can count with me if you want, just count;on a one count, i hit right through the bag - can you show me that again? - you just   just say \"one,\" please - one  - ok, one - one  - ok yeah, just say one  that's good  that's good then i move over to my right foot you'll see my weight is shifting to my right foot then i hit it with the back of my hand, sort of like i'm chipping ice with an ice pick then i come over,and i shift to my left foot, and i hit it with my right hand and ice pick maneuver again, and i come over on my right foot and hit it right, left don't watch anything but my feet one, two, three   just do it like that  just keep practicing need to show 'em how to stand, keep their legs under their shoulders to make a fighter, you got to strip 'em down to bare wood rest when you're dead come here you can't just tell 'em to \"forget everything you know  \"you got to make 'em forget it in their bones left uppercut, left, left make 'em so tired they only listen to you,only hear your voice, only do what you say and nothing else move your feet move your feet around  let's see you go show 'em how to keep their balanceand take it away from the other guy not so low  look at me right hook and just turn right over   how to generate momentum off your right toeand how to flex your knees when you fire a jab how to fight backing up,so that the other guy doesn't want to come after you then you got to show 'em all over again -over and over and over till they think they were born that way shift  shift away  shift away ok, that's enough for today good work  good girl think i'm ready for a fight, boss?hey hey come here you're not breathing hate to disagree with you every time you get under pressure, you're holding your breath now, stop doing that ok but other than that, i'm doing pretty good, right?i mean, for a girl i don't train girls think i might be ready for a fight, boss?well, we'll get a manager, and we'll find out, won't we?i'd like to, but you've been keeping me too busy got any family, boss?what?you been spending all this time with me  i didn't know if

back here?of course, if maggie loses, it wouldn't mean anything to sally might even help him lonnie's girl gets another win,lonnie might let sally's lightweight fight joey adagio for the title sally's trying to set a fight with adagio?hey, what do i know?i just come cos i enjoy the fights mother of god!ok, break!hey! come here, come here hey get over here!you're dropping your left hand  quit dropping your left hand hey, frankie, you mind if i talk to my fighter?you're doing a hell of a job of it  is this how you advise your lightweight?dunn, what the hell are you doing?- i'm talking  what you doing? - this your fighter?it's my fighter!it ain't fitting real well, sally fine  you take her  she can't fight worth a shit, anyway somebody tell me what's going on i was late  sally was just subbing for me you're telling me this is your fighter?yeah, this is my fighter then you got ten seconds i keep holding my left up, then i throw a punch and it drops - well, let it drop  - that'd be a lot easier she thinks she knows you, that's all every time you drop it, she comes right over the top,so you just wait for her, see?that's all she's thinking about and when she cocks that big right hand, you hear me?and when she does, you step to the side and come over with this big \"good night\" hook - got one? - got it right here ok - fight, or i'm calling it  - go give it to her the body knows what fighters don't - how to protect itself a neck can only twist so far twist it just a hair more and the body says\"hey, i'll take it from here cos you obviously don't know what you're doing  \"neutral corner two, three, four - see the way she did that? - yeah sugar ray would do that  girl's got sugar \"lie down now  rest and we'll talk about this when you regain your senses  \"it's called the knockout mechanism don't get all carried away, now  good girl thanks, boss you, uh    you forgot the rule - now, what is the rule? - keep my left up?it's to protect yourself at all times now, what is the rule?protect myself at all times good, good you gave me away  how's that protecting me?it wasn't it's ok i'll work on my left, boss drink your water other than that, how'd i do?fine  you did fine you gonna leave me again?never that place you work - do they have homemade lemon meringue pie there?sure not the kind with the canned filling crap?oh, big can, yea size  it says \"homemade\" on the label - i want you to take the weekend off  - it's only thursday you gonna argue with me?know better than to do that, boss good all fighters are pig-headed some way or other some part of them always thinks they know better than you about something can you uh    spare a few minutes for the immaculate conception?truth is even if they're wrong,even if that one thing is going to be the ruin of them,if you can beat that last bit out of 'em,then they ain't fighters at all thought i said i'd see you monday you sure did, boss that was last night you said not to argue with you damn woman won't do a thing i tell her you want my advice?what?where are your shoes?i'm airing out my feet you got big holes in your socks oh, they're not that big didn't i give you money for some new ones?these are my sleeping socks my feet like a little air at night how come you're wearing 'em in the daytime, then?cos my daytime socks got too many holes in 'em well, if i give you some more money, you buy some new socks please well, i'd be tempted, but i couldn't say for sure might find its way to the track oh!didn't take maggie long to hit her stride i got the breathing thing down no, you ain't breathing because you're knocking 'em out in the first round thought that was the point the point is to get good can't get good if you keep knocking 'em out in the first round how am i going to get you fights?nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed why am i still doing four-rounders boss?cos you haven't got the lungs for six rounds, that's why i do if i keep knocking 'em out in the first round frankie made her fight one more four-rounder,just to let her know who was boss three, four, five,six, seven sorry, boss maggie left no doubt about it her first six-rounder didn't go quite as smooth down!to the corner  three, four   five,six, seven,eight,nine, ten! it's over!maggie didn't knock her out till the end of the first round after that no manager wanted to put his fighter in with maggie frankie had to go into his pocket to get her decent fights,sweetening the purse by paying managers on the side but that only worked for so long then frankie did something he hated doing he took a chance he moved her up in class that could've been a mistake break  break  step back time - dang  - dang hey, give us two seconds, will ya? just two seconds - your nose is broke  - dang!- fix it  - i can't  i can't you can fix it - i can't  i've gotta call it  - i've seen what you can do  fix it i can snap it back into place, but i can't stop the bleeding the ring doctor's gonna call it please  if you can stop the blood, i can beat her bite down on this ok inhale - what? - inhale what?breathe in ok, huh?yeah, it's ok yeah  all right you got 20 seconds before this turns into a geyserand it's gonna spray all over the front row 20 seconds - that's all you've got get goin' go to your corner!two,three, four, five,six, seven,eight,nine, ten!\"mo cuishle  \"whatcha reading?what's she saying?wants to know what you're reading it's yeats keep your head back why don't you talk a little yeats to her?show her what a treat that is when the hell they gonna get to her?i'm ok, frankie what'd you learn tonight?always protect myself - what's the rule? - always protect myself - margaret fitzgerald? - here i'll be right here how you doin'?- me? - yeah, you i'm not the one who's hurt broken nose don't hurt that much why are you telling me that?no reason but some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone and no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding did you write your daughter?every week i've no idea why you come to church after her 12th straight knockout, frankie got a couple of real good offers the first was to fight billie, \"the blue bear\", osterman for the wba welterweight title billie the blue bear!billie was a former prostitute out of east berlin had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks didn't matter to her, something like that could kill a person and the crowds loved her he turned it down without even telling her the next was to fight the british champ, a jamaican girl billie just beat hello?not interested he turned that down too that's a lot of money, boss yeah  you're making money  what're you still working here for?it's a title match, right?are you british? it's a title you can't take away she's got nothing to lose, you got nothing to win might still be a good fight yeah  i ju    i just brought you up to welterweight too good to fight these contenders, you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?didn't notice i was fighting any contenders well, you can get yourself another manager any time you want in fact, if you'd learnt to protect your face a little better,i wouldn't have to turn down this money my face out there so much, it's a miracle i ain't been knocked out yet, boss no you can't work here anymore tonight i made us a reservation you um   you might want to shower here you go here you go what's this?well, ain't no big secret what you're wishing for go on and blow thank you 33 ain't so old i was still fighting at 39 fought for 23 years how's it going, scrap?ah, doin' good, mickey doin' good what are you having?coffee you two not speaking?don't hardly know him i met frankie right after my 37th birthday he was picking up cut work he used to patch me up when i thought it was impossible good man to have in your corner yes, he is he stayed with me through my last fight in san berdoo my manager was off getting drunk somewhere and   it was just frankie and me i was taking a hellacious beating everybody's got a particular number of fights in 'em nobody tells you what that number is mine was 109 i just didn't want to admit it fourth round, this   this cut opens up blood starts pouring into my eye they should've stopped the fight,but, hell, i was a black man in san berdoo -blood was what i was there for round after round, i kept getting frankie to patch me up he's talking about throwing in the towel,but he ain't my manager, he can't throw in nothing round after round, he's arguing with me and i'm almost laughing,cos, hell, it's getting more to him than to me i go 15 rounds, lose by decision next morning, i lose the eye in 23 years, he's never said a thing about it doesn't have to  i can see it in his face every time he looks at me somehow   frankie thinks he should've stopped that fight should've saved my eye spends his life wishing he could take back that 109th fight see, i wanted to go to 110 thing is      if you want to get to the title      maybe he's not the one to take you there you tell mr  mack we'd be here tonight?go on and eat your cupcake no  i got it it's the rule - always protect yourself people never take their own advice if she was going to leave frankiebetter she did it to him then mr  mickey mack?i'm maggie fitzgerald i hear you're a    a real good manager doing, uh, good things for big willie but i thought you should know i ain't never leaving mr  dunn,so you don't need to make any more excuses to bump into me sorry for interrupting your dinner maggie always did like taking 'em out in the first round the letters always came back marked the same way \"return to sender\" i will uh    make you some coffee what are you doing with your money?saving it good girl you know, you save enough of it, you ought to get yourself a little house cash, no mortgage it'll be a while 'fore i can do that yeah, well, it might be a stretch,but, uh, you gotta get yourself a place of your own go around wasting it on things that don't matter, what do you got?you understand?pretty soon, you wait long enough, you got nothing ok soon as i get the money well, i made a lot of mistakes in my life  i'm just trying to

very intelligent, handsome man you ain't gonna make me talk no more yeats, are you?no, i was      looking at this catalogue from city college i thought i'd get you a wheelchair, maybe the   the kind that operates by blowing through a straw i thought maybe you'd like to go back to school i got a favor to ask you, boss sure anything you want remember what my daddy did for axel?don't even think about that i can't be like this, frankie not after what i done i seen the world people chanted my name well      not my name, some damn name you gave me but they were chanting for me i was in magazines you think i ever dreamed that'd happen?i was born two pounds, one-and-a-half ounces daddy used to tell me i fought to get into this world      and i'd fight my way out that's all i want to do, frankie i just don't wanna fight you to do it i got what i needed i got it all don't let 'em keep taking it away from me don't let me lie here till i can't hear those people chanting no more i can't please please don't ask me i'm askin' i can't hello?in the middle of the night maggie'd found her own solution she'd bit her tongue stop  stop look at me  look at me nearly bled to death before they stitched her up she came round and ripped 'em out before frankie even got there they stitched her up again,padded the tongue so she couldn't bite you can't do it  you know that i do, father but you don't know how thick she is, how hard it was to train her other fighters'd do exactly what you say to 'em and   and she'd ask why this and why that and then do it her own way, anyway how she fought for the title, i   it wasn't by anything   well, it wasn't by listening to me but that   but now she wants to die,and i just want to keep her with me oh and i swear to god, father, it's   it's committing a sin by doing it by keeping her alive, i'm killing her know what i mean?how do i get around that?you don't you step aside, frankie you leave her with god she's not asking for god's help; she's asking for mine frankie, i've seen you at mass almost every day for 23 years the only person comes to church that muchis the kind who can't forgive himself for something whatever sins you're carrying,they're nothing compared to this forget about god   or heaven and hell if you do this thing, you'll be lost      somewhere so deep      you'll never find yourself again i think i did it already we're keeping her sedated so she won't try that again i went to see maggie this morning you must've been somewhere else yeah you got a fight i don't know about?it wasn't your fault i was wrong to say that you're damn right i found you a fighter,and you made her the best fighter she could be i killed her don't say that maggie walked through that door with nothing but guts no chance in the world of being what she needed to be a year and a half later, she's fighting for the championship of the world you did that people die every day frankie,mopping floors washing dishes and you know what their last thought is?\"i never got my shot  \"because of you, maggie got her shot if she dies today, you know what her last thought will be?\"i think i did all right  \"i know i could rest with that yeah yeah yeah  yeah i'm gonna get a cup of coffee yeah all right i'm gonna disconnect your air machine,then you're gonna go to sleep then i'll give you a shot, and you'll   stay asleep \"mo cuishle\"      means \"my darling, my blood  \"he gave her a single shot it was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over he didn't want her going through this again then he walked out i don't think he had anything left i went back to the gymand waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later and that's when a ghost came through the door i got to thinking what you said, mr  scrap what was that, danger?anybody can lose one fight that's the truth go on, put the gloves on you missed a lot of training will do, mr  scrap  sure thing frankie never came back at all frankie didn't leave a note and nobody knew where he went i'd hoped he'd gone to find youand ask you one more time to forgive him,but maybe he didn't have anything left in his heart i just hope he found someplace where he could find a little peace a place set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and goodbye but that's probably wishful thinking no matter where he is i thought you should know what kind of man your father really was "}, {"title": "The Sting", "year": "1973", "rating": "93", "actors": "Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Robert Shaw, Charles Durning", "director": "George Roy Hill", "subtitles": "no

make it a policy to talk to my new men now, i have a fine, smooth-running outfit if i like a soldier, he can get to be a noncommissioned officerquicker here than anywhere else but he has to show me that he's got it on the ball what kind of trouble were you in in the bugle corps?- no trouble, sir  - what made you transfer out then?it was a personal matter - something you wanted to ask, sergeant? - why, yes, sir prewitt, you was a corporal in the bugle corps you took a bust to buck private to transfer to an infantry outfit why? because you like to hike?or was it because you couldn't stand to bugle?it was a personal matter that's up to the company commander to decide well?i was first bugler for two years the topkick had a friend who transferred in from another outfit the next day, he was made first bugler over me i was a better bugler and you asked out on account of that?maybe it ain't sensible, but that's the reason his feelings were hurt  kids they send us now!well, we'll get your stripes back for you, maybe an extra one for good measure do you know why you were assigned to \"g\" company?no, sir i pulled a few strings  i'm the regimental boxing coach, you know yes, sir i saw your fight with connors in the bowl year before last - you should have won it  - thank you, sir our regiment got beaten in the finals last december,but i mean to win this year all i've needed was a

- yes, i heard about that it's too bad  i can understand how you feel  but those things happen that's why i decided i would quit, sir you might as well say stop war because one man got killed our fighting program is the best morale builder we have i've got a mighty sour company bugler - how'd you like the job? - not if it means fighting looks to me as if you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, prewitt you should know that in the army it's not the individual that counts well, you'll find that we won't put any pressure on you in my outfit just don't make any mistakes in it, that's all i've got to go into town  anything else for me today, sergeant?the company fund report has got to be made out, it's due tomorrow - you make it out  is that all? - no, sir well, whatever it

hawaiian hotel who is that?she's captain holmes' wife you'll fight, prewitt you'll fight because captain holmes wants to be major holmes he's got an idea he'll make it if he gets a winning team and if you don't do it for him, you'll do it for me 'cause my job is to keep him happy, see?the more he's happy, the less he bothers me and the better i run this company so we know where we stand, don't we,

soldiered at fort bliss with holmes,i heard plenty about this lady, plenty - you did, huh? - okay, not me but i know some of the guys she played around with, so don't tell me i ain't tellin' you

karen?- sorry i'm late  - it doesn't matter i got tied up with general slater - i bumped into him in the officer's club  - yeah?- what did the general have to say? - success, he said success in war, success in peace time and not a word about my promotion sometimes i think the old man's just waiting to ship me down well, if you'd spend less time buttering generalsand more time with your company, you'd get that promotion the company takes care of itself i went over there today, looking for you i had some business to attend to at kaneohe that was all right, wasn't it?of course  i have no right to inquire into your actions - that was our agreement  - then why bring it up?because i wanted you to know i'm not as stupid as you maintain all women are now, just what does that mean?- what are you accusing me of now? - of nothing it's no longer any of my business how many women you go out with, is it?but i wish you could just be honest about it once there's no reason i should try to hide anything, is there?the way things are between us now,what right have you to always be accusing me?what right?are you going back to that again?how long will it be, i wonder, before i'm allowed to live that down?how many times do i have to tell you it was an accident?please, dana  i'm going to bed please get out of my bedroom captain holmes says you don't want to come out and fight for us that's right we thought we'd buy you a beer and talk it over we're the company boxers i figured man, what i would not give to have this characterin the corner pool room in my hometown box as good as you used to, we'd be a cinch this year you ain't forget, division champs get 10-day furloughs, did you, son?i'm ike galovitch, platoon guide of your platoon and don't think you're a tough guy, prewitt you no talk now, but out in the field with us you sing different song listen, the guy don't have to fight if he don't want to without gettin' kicked around now, we're playing pool  why don't you take off?- you want busted head, maggio? - no then keep your big nose out altogether training season starts next week  you can pick up your stuff   look, i told holmes and i'm telling you i ain't fightin'  i quit fightin' you guys want to put the screws on, go right ahead!- i can take anything you can dish out  - okay, prewitt thanks i just hate to see a good guy get it in the gut you better get used to it, kid  you'll probably see a lot of it before you die you don't scare easy, do you, prewitt?do you know anything in army regulations says i gotta box?every boxer in this outfit's a noncom i guess you've never seen a bunch of 'em get together and give a man the treatment what do you mean \"chick\"? she's 45 she's still too young for you now, listen, warden, i'm a better man than you any day, and don't forget it i won't forget it what's the deal with him, anyway?with warden  i don't figure him warden?he ain't like the others he'll make it tough on you but he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair, and he won't come over it you don't see many topkicks like him no more he was with the 15th in shanghai when they saw their action i heard about it down in the philippines even all i know

\"waste,\" did you say?there's a subject i might tell you something about i know several kinds of waste, sergeant you're probably not even remotely aware of some of them would you like to hear?for instance, what about the house without a child?there's one sort for you then there's another you're doing fine, sergeant my husband's off somewhere,and it's raining outside and we're both drinking now

here, sergeant  i'll tell you the story you can take it back to the barracks with you i'd only been married to dana two years when i found out he was cheating and by that time, i was pregnant  i thought i had something to hope for i was almost happy the night the pains began i remember dana was going to an officer's conference i told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him and maybe he would have, if his conference hadn't been with a hat check girl he was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a m i was lying on the floor i begged him to go for the doctor, but he fell on the couch and passed out the baby was born about an hour later of course it was dead  it was a boy but they worked over me at the hospital  they fixed me up fine they even took my appendix out  they threw that in free - karen? - and one more thing  no more children sure, i went out with men after that, and if i'd ever found one that   karen, listen to me  listen i know until i met you, i didn't think it was possible either i enlisted, too  i came out here on my own to get away from my hometown in oregon how come?i had a boyfriend i was a waitress, and he was from the richest family in town he just married a girl suitable for his position after three years of going around with me it's a pretty story, isn't it? maybe they could write a book about it they did  thousands of them so i left and went to seattle i got there and i met a girl just back from hawaii,and she said she'd made a lot of money working there so i caught the first boat i've been here a year and two months you don't like it very much, do you?oh, i don't like it, but i don't mind it  anyway, i won't be here forever no  sure  i mean, why should you?i got it all figured out  in another year, i'll be home with a stocking full of money and i'll be all set for life who is it?i didn't hear no sounds of combat, so i thought you might want a drink - you've been hogging the whiskey, angelo  - not me, buddy it's that sandra  she's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish i hope there's a cop under that keep pourin'  keep pourin' no, thanks  i don't drink  i think it's a weakness i grant you that i don't like weakness  do you?no, i don't like weakness, but i like to drink hey, what are you gonna do, marry this guy?you're grinnin' at him like you're his wife get out of here okay, okay  i'm goin' back to old long-legged sandra  i love 'em tall acres and acres enjoy yourself, paisan  you need this more than i do tomorrow, you'll be back with the treatment what does he mean?hey, that was nice before, the way you snuggled up in front of him what's a \"treatment\"?oh, some of the guys puttin' me over the jumps 'cause i don't want to fight fight?yeah, on a boxing team  i don't want to box  i don't even want to think about it well, why should you have to box?well, see, i used to fight middleweight  and i was pretty good they know it  well, anyway   well, come on, tell me  i want to hear well, the thing is, see   i used to work out with this guy dixie wells he was a real good friend of mine loved to box  people on the outside had their eye on him he was gonna come out of the army and go right up to the top well, one afternoon, he and i were sparring around in the gym,you know, kind of friendly-like,and he must have been set pretty flat on his feet,because i caught him with a   no more than ordinary right cross   and he didn't get up, he didn't move he was in a coma for a week, and finally he did pull out of it only the thing was that he was blind well, i went to see him at the hospital a couple of times,then, finally, i just couldn't go back the last time, he and i started talking about fighting, and   he started to cry and seeing tears coming out of those eyesthat couldn't see anything i thought i oughta tell you  holmes spoke to his boxers last night from now on, it's no holds barred they aim to run you right into the stockade if they got to let 'em i'll help you as much as i can, but i can't get too far out on a limb i ain't riskin' losing my stripes  i like this outfit so do i  that's funny, ain't it?yeah  yeah, that is funny keep goin' in a straight line, prewitt keep

warden speaking  yes, sir yes, sir, i'll have his things in order he got it  six months i'm gonna escape from this dump gimbel's basement couldn't hold me, neither can no lousy stockade - shut up  - whatever you say, brownie prisoner, halt!hello, tough monkey this other girl and i were lucky to rent it this is a very fashionable district i have another key made for you you can use it any time you want to, even when i'm not here - hi  - hi this is prew, the soldier i told you about - this is georgette, my roommate  - well, welcome, friend there hasn't been a man around the house since the cat died i belong to the book guild club  i always take every book that's the way i get all the dividends she'll be great for your friend maggio when he gets out of the stockade yes, he'll be crazy about her just sit down and get comfortable i'll make you a martini and see what's to cook for dinner hey, this is like being married, ain't it?it's better you okay?glad you came?let's get out of here  don't look around it can't go on like this much longer even when we sneaked clear across the island tonight,we had to run out like jailbirds if there was only some way we   holmes would probably give you a divorce,but he'd never let me transfer out of his outfit there is a way i've been thinking about it  you've got to become an officer you can take the new extension course, the one they passed last may when you get your commission, they'd ship you back to the states an officer?yes  then i could divorce dana and marry you i hate officers! i've always hated officers!well, that's a fine, intelligent point of view suppose i said i always hated sergeants? that'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?you sure made a complete study of it okay, suppose i did it  and don't think it's a cinch then you'd be getting your divorce here while i was in the states we'd be apart maybe six months  we're sure to be into a war by then why don't you tell the truth?you just don't want the responsibility you're probably not even in love with me you're crazy! i wish i didn't love you!maybe i could enjoy life again so they were married and lived unhappily ever after i've never been so miserable in my life as i have since i met you neither have i i wouldn't trade a minute of it neither would i i'll probably make the lousiest officer in this man's army you ever saw you'll make a fine officer a remarkable officer thank you come here can't you wait until we finish dinner?- honey? - what?i want to marry you you're a funny one why? why is it funny if a guy wants to marry you?because i'm a girl you met at the new congress club that's about two steps up from the pavement well, what am i? i'm a private no-class dogface the way most civilians look at that, that's two steps up from nothing prew, i thought we were happy why do you want to spoil things?look, i've got a year to go before i reenlist if i can swing sergeant's stripes by then, they'll let me go back to the states then you and i can go back there together, if you'll wait how do you expect to become a sergeant under that captain holmes of yours?it's all you can do to keep out of the stockade i'll fight - no, you're not gonna fight  - it'd be worth it prew, it's true we love each other now,we need each other,but back in the states, it might be different that ain't the real reason - all right, it's not  - what is the real reason?i won't marry you, because i don't want to be the wife of a soldier well, that would be about the best i could ever do for you because nobody's gonna stop me from my plan  nobody  nothing because i want to be proper - proper? - yes, proper in another year, i'll have enough money saved,and then i'm gonna go back to my hometown in oregon,and i'm gonna build a house for my mother and myself,and join the country club and take up golf and i'll meet the proper man with the proper position,and make a proper wife who can run a proper home and raise proper children and i'll be happy because when you're proper, you're safe you got guts, honey i hope you can pull it off i do mean it when i say i need you,'cause i'm lonely you think i'm lying, don't you?nobody ever lies about being lonely and don't talk to me about a divorce why? because the scandal would spoil your chances for a promotion?i ask you once more i want to know who he is and where you met him i'm not going to tell you one thing i know  i know he's a civilian  you'd be too discreet to pick an army man i wonder which is hurt more, your pride or your curiosity?you can't expect to know how i feel about a thing like this i wonder why men feel so differently about it than women it's just not the same it's a lovely day  i think i'll go for a walk hey i hear you just got out of the stockade it was rugged  i kept my mouth shut, and i didn't get in no trouble did you see maggio?fatso's really got it in for maggio he's using a billy, too places where it won't show, in the back, in the chest he's got it down to a system he kicks him a lot, too you know how maggio's taking it?he just keeps spittin' in fatso's eye ain't he a hot one?he's a good man well, fatso can't make a dent in him but that fatso, he's smart he makes sure the o d  never sees nothing why doesn't maggio go to the o d  himself?we tried to get him to, but he won't peep that boy's about the toughest nut in the woods you think he's gonna be all right, huh?- well, maybe he's cracking, at that  - what do you mean?after fatso threw him in the hole, that's solitary,he started talking a couple of times about how he's gonna escape he said to tell you he'll look you up one of these nights still on your knees, huh, prewitt?well, boxing finals next month  december 15th you've still got time to help us win the championship are you proud to be in

same thing the face, prew! hit him in the face!- come on, galovitch, fight fair! - i'll fight any way i want!come on, prew! get him!why doesn't that officer stop that fight?- what's his name, major? -

well, don't mention it \"upon observing these incidents,\"an investigation was made by the inspector general's department\"over a period of several months \"it was found that captain holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty\"to the aforesaid private prewitt \"as mentioned, this included the instigation of wholly unauthorized tactics\"to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team \"i'm waiting for your reply i haven't any, sir holmes, the first thing i learned in the armywas that an officer takes care of his men it seems to be the first thing that you forgot my only regret is that we have to keep you in uniformuntil a court-martial is concluded if there were any way to avoid a court-martial, sir there is one alternative, general, if you are so disposed a resignation for the good of the service, under army regulations write a letter of resignation  have it on my desk this afternoon as far as i'm concerned,the quicker you're out of the army, the better for everybody,especially the army that's all, holmes i know what's been going on in this outfit i know how far some of you have been out of line if you want to remain noncoms, you'd better snap into it and another thing, from now on,no man's gonna earn his stripes by boxing - get rid of those  - yes, sir dismissed - about sergeant galovitch  - yes, sir bust him  sergeant galovitch is now private galovitch put him in charge of the latrine what are you grinning at?i think the company commander made a wise decision, sir company \"g,\" captain ross - just a minute  it's for you, sergeant  - thank

being sent back to the states  he's sailing next week he wants me to go with him  what'll we do?when do you think you'll get your commission?i didn't put it in i filled it out, but i didn't sign it i took it out of my desk a dozen times, but i couldn't sign it why?but it was the plan - i know, i know  - it's been weeks you can't just say you'll do a thing and then not do it karen, listen to me but why didn't you do it? why didn't you tell me?be back in a minute i'm sorry  i thought you were somebody else i thought it was a guy from our company, prewitt, the kid i was telling you about the one that got mixed up with one of the girls at the new congress club he's a w o l  probably in lots of trouble robert e  lee prewitt, a crazy, no good   karen, i'm no officer  i'm an enlisted man i can't be anything else if i try to be an officer, i'll be putting on an act i just can't do it  please don't ask me why i know why you don't have to become an officer now, milt,now that dana's out of the army you just don't want to marry me you're already married to the army i love you, karen i know  i know i don't want you to go back to holmes i don't want to either, but i am there's nothing else for

- twenty,sire  twenty minutes!twenty minutes of continuous music  no recitatives!sire,only opera can do this in a play,if more than one person speaks at once      it's just noise but with opera,with music      you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time it's not noise  it's a perfect harmony!mozart,music is not the issue here no one doubts your talent  it's your literary judgment that's in question even with the politics taken out,it would still remain a vulgar farce why waste your spirit on such rubbish?surely you can choose more elevated themes elevated! what does that mean,elevated?i am fed to the teeth with these      elevated things  old dead legends why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?because they do they go on forever at least what they represent: the eternal in us opera is here to ennoble us,mozart you and me,just the same as his majesty \"bello,bello,bello \" come on now,be honest!you'd rather listen to your hairdresser than hercules,horatius or orpheus people so lofty,they sound as if they shit marble!what!govern your tongue,mozart! how dare you!forgive me,majesty i'm a vulgar man      but i assure you,my music is not you are passionate,mozart      but you do not persuade sire,the whole opera is finished do you know how much work went into it?his majesty has been more than patient,\"signore\" how can i persuade if i can't show it?that will do,\"herr mozart\" just let me tell you how it begins may i just do that,majesty? show you how it begins? just that?please look   there's a servant on his knees  do you know why?not from oppression  he's measuring a space do you know what for?his bed  his wedding bed to see if it will fit!late late!on the beat good!yes!early!well,mozart is already rehearsing in that case,gentlemen,i think   i think we should help mozart all we can and protect him against the emperor's anger what anger?about the ballet what ballet?excuse me      but didn't his majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?- herr mozart! - yes?- a word with you  - certainly,\"herr direktor\" now,\"herr mozart\"!five minutes,please five minutes!yes?do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?- it's not a ballet,it's a dance  - exactly  a dance surely,his majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story it's dangerous to interpret his edicts  give me your score,please thank you what are you doing,\"herr direktor\"?taking out what you should never have put in please  please!i have no one else to turn to - what is it?

  by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country men      all this stuff you've heard about america not wanting to fight      wanting to stay out of the war      is a lot of horse dung americans      traditionally love to fight all real americans love the sting of battle when you were kids      you all admired the champion marble shooter      the fastest runner, big-league ball players, the toughest boxers americans love a winner      and will not tolerate a loser americans play to win all the time i wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed that's why americans have never lost and will never lose a war      because the very thought of losing      is hateful to americans now      an army is a team it lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team this individuality stuff is a bunch of crap the bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality      for the saturday evening post      don't know anything more about real battle than they do

until 0900 yes, i gathered that - you know my boy, dick jenson  - yes brad, tell me - what are you doing here? - ike wanted a report on kasserine meanwhile, i have to stay here as an observer      but i report directly to ike you're spying get me general eisenhower's headquarters tell me, brad      what happened at kasserine? i heard it was a shambles apparently, everything went wrong we'd send over a 75mm shell, the krauts would return an 88 their tanks are diesels even when we managed to hit one they kept on running  our tanks   the men call them \"purple heart boxes  \"one hot piece of shrapnel and the gasoline explodes i warned them about the tank i taiked to one of the soldiers about the half-tracks i asked them if the machine-gun bullets pierced the armor and he said, \"no, sir

know, but it doesn't become official until it's approved by the senate well      they have their schedule and i have mine george      if you were named admiral of the turkish navy      i believe your aides could dip into their haversacks      and come up with the appropriate badge of rank anyway, congratulations  premature congratulations you know   i think those stars look better on a green shirt did i ever tell you about the time i designed a uniform for tank crewmen?it was green leather, it had red stripes      and sort of a row of brass buttons down across here and topped off by a gold football helmet the army rejected it, of course goddamn, it was beautiful (whistle blows)lloyd fredendall is just leaving george, there's one other thing i put in my kasserine report some of our boys were just plain scared that's understandable even the best foxhound is gun-shy the first time out i can remember      when nothing frightened me as much as the idea of      a bullet coming straight for my nose i don't know why, but the image of a bullet coming right for my nose      was more horrible than any other possibility well, i can understand that, with such a handsome nose you want to know why this outfit got the hell kicked out of it?blind man could see it in a minute they don't look like soldiers  they don't act like soldiers why should they fight like soldiers?you're absolutely right  the discipline's pretty poor ln about 15 minutes we're going to start turning these boys      into fanatics, razors they'll lose their fear of the germans i hope to god they never lose their fear of me up bright and early, general? breakfast?have all my officers finished breakfast?we're open from 6 till 8 most of the officers are just coming in, sir please inform these officers the mess

can't use my stethoscope when i'm wearing my helmet well      then cut two holes in your helmet so that you can and get those yellow-bellies out of here, today hold it turn right, here the battlefield

supposed to let him win this one no matter what they're entitled to have their hero montgomery did push rommel clear across north africa what about the americans? don't they need a hero too?you have anybody in mind?air vice-marshal coningham is here with general buford excuse me, gentlemen      while i ask our british friends what's happened to our air cover bradley: harry how are you?george  good to see you - you know arthur coningham  - sir arthur delighted to see you i've heard so much about you gentlemen, it appears there's been a slight misunderstanding here      and ike thought we should fix it no, no  no misunderstanding we're supposed to have allied air cover and we don't german planes are strafing my troops if i may say so, general, i'm afraid your operation reports are inaccurate report? three days ago, the crowds took off after my command car      ran my ass into a ditch my staff has assured me, we have complete air supremacy      everywhere in the mediterranean patton: when i complained about air cover      you said our troops were not battleworthy you spoke of the discredited practice of using air force as an alibi      for lack of success on the ground i have to wet-nurse montgomery, i don't have to stand for that i sincerely apologize for that remark, whoever made it and i promise you one thing, general:you will see no more german planes (chicken squawks)we were discussing air supremacy, sir arthur (horn honks)(gunfire)damn door won't open!by god, that's enough!get that thing out of here!come on, you bastards, take a shot at me on the nose!get back in here, george! we need a corps commander, not a casualty coningham: how'd you manage to stage that?i don't know      but if i could find the nazis flying those things      i'd give them each a medal patton: can't get over how cold it gets in the desert awfully cold, sir patton: rommel's out there somewhere, waiting for me jenson: yes, sir patton: you know      if i had my way, i'd send that

paces  we'd get out, we'd shake hands      then we'd button up and do battle, just the two of us that battle would decide the outcome of the war it's too bad jousting's gone out of style it's like

prisoners good  very good you're not surprised, are you? after all, you trained that outfit - excuse me, general  - hm?this is interesting  we've discovered rommel wasn't present at el guettar - who says so? - g2, sir when we took 10th panzer, rommel was in berlin with an earache?severe nasal diphtheria, sir also, hitler probably retained rommel in berlin      because things were going badly for the africa corps he didn't want his favorite general to lose face i'm my favorite general, and i don't like to be told      that some second-stringer is up against me  then i lose face who the hell are you, anyway?carver: general, this is lieutenant colonel codman  your new aide codman  i pulled your name off the list because i know your family i'm glad you did, sir rommel is the best the krauts have, and i kicked the hell out of him now my own g2 section is telling me he wasn't even there but, general, he undoubtedly planned the german battle if you defeat rommel's plan, you've defeated rommel  lsn't that true?codman   - have a drink with me tonight  - yes, sir i have a plan for the invasion of sicily i want to make sure i get it approved  you can help me i want to give a dinner for general alexander get to him before montgomery does this will be strictly a formal affair, codman, but purely social by that i mean   -    purely political  - yes, sir i want the finest food, the best wine available  everything, comme il faut (speaks in french)(speaking in french)(speaks in french)thank you george, this is really splendid wine thank you, arthur thank you sir harold, i think it was alcibiades in the peloponnesian war      415 b c he said, \"if syracuse falls, all sicily falls, and then italy  \"he knew that syracuse was the jugular of the island old alcibiades always went for the throat i propose to take sicily in the same way - how's it going? - the old man has them in his pocket patton: now, according to my plan      general montgomery will land here i'll hit the beaches here, take palermo monty will drive north on the coast, i'll come due east      take messina and cut off the german escape route yes   it looks like an interesting plan well, gentlemen, to the conquest of sicily alexander: to the conquest of sicily officers: to sicily!george, you'd have made a great marshal for napoleon      if you'd lived in the 18th century but i did, sir  i did morning  is general smith in?man: i believe he's in the lavatory  - thank you - ah, there you are, bedell  - monty bedell, i've been giving a good bit of thought to the sicily operation yes?i assume we're alone georgie patton has already discussed his plan with alexander i realize that      but i have an idea that his plan may lead to an absolute disaster oh?bedell, look this is sicily now then, according to patton's plan      i will attack syracuse here and he would attack palermo up here now, obviously our forces would be divided and obviously, they could be chopped up piecemeal now then, what i propose, and what i shall insist on, by the way      is this (montgomery exhales)i will land at syracuse as planned but the americans- the americans will land here, at gela i will advance north to messina, the americans protecting my flank after all, messina is the key it's the reason for invading sicily i'll discuss your plan with ike i'm sure he'll give it serious consideration - amusing, isn't it? - what?that the plans for the invasion of sicily      should have been put forward in an algerian lavatory george, i have bad news for you about your sicily plan ike has turned it down since the italians will be defending their native soil for the first time      and the german resistance is stiffening, we shouldn't be divided - well, where do my people land then? - in the gulf of gela there's nothing there but a beach yes, but it puts you in a good position to support montgomery where does montgomery land?he'll land in syracuse and drive north to catania  possibly even messina and you'll be alongside, protecting his left i see ln other words, we get the burden again while good old monty gets the glory ike had to consider all points of view he made his decision not as an american, but as an ally had it been the other way around, i assure you, monty would protest no      i've been in the army 30 years when i get an order, i say, \"yes, sir  \" and i do my best to carry it out this is what happens when your commander stops being an american      and starts being an ally <font color=\"#ffff00\">here's the gangster patton, landing at gela with his seventh army

</font><font color=\"#ffff00\">he is most capable, yet unpretentious </font><font color=\"#ffff00\">unusual for a general </font><font color=\"#ffff00\">sorry   </font>i don't think i've made myself clear, sir it's true, montgomery met the toughest resistance there at catania however, if we're-perfectly clear old monty is as stuck as a bug on flypaper but this order from general alexander      directing you to turn over the vizzini-caltagirone road to montgomery well, then, old bradley will have to slug- slug, mind you      his way up center of the island over those tough mountain roads, won't he?yes, sir messina, bell messina      is the heart of it  if they'd followed my plan, i'd be there by now i'd cut off the retreat of every german on this island!now, you know what i'm gonna do?i'm gonna go to palermo i'm gonna beat that limey at messina if it's the last thing i ever do!hey, what's all this talk about taking the vizzini road away from 2nd corps?general alexander's orders  road goes to montgomery now, that road was assigned to me how can i get north without it? you know the terrain there i'm sorry, brad  but monty's run into tough opposition  very tough you wouldn't be taking advantage of this situation, would you?i don't know what you're talking about without that road, your army, except for my 2nd corps      would be out of a job free for you to go into palermo who said anything about palermo?i can read a map does alexander know you've pushed out this far?that's a reconnaissance in force george      are you saying i've got to slug it out in those mountains      with heavy resistance?just so you can make a bigger splash than monty?general      i just follow my orders like the simple old soldier i am general bradley sir, general alexander has heard we're moving west he says here, \"stop immediately  go no farther than agrigento repeat  stop, immediately  \"that's what you think it says i think it was garbled in transmission ask them to re-transmit the message that'll take half a day at least yes, sir now, brad where were we?we were talking about a simple      old soldier look at that, gentlemen compared to war      all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance let's go, sergeant  move out!give me that helmet come on, let's get out of here!what silly son of a bitch is in charge of this operation?i don't know, but they ought to hang him patton: afternoon, padre padre: these men are here from the states, looking over our program      for the spiritual welfare of the men we'll take you right into palermo col  david toured us around

came the arabs      spaniards, neapolitans now comes      the american army this is from general alexander, sir      reminding you that you are not to take palermo send him a message, cod ask him if he wants me to give it back patton: let me ask you a question for a change you've just come from washington how do they feel about our boys taking palermo?the general impression is, your army barreled through token resistance      while montgomery faced the brunt of the fighting don't they know we took on the hermann g\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdring division?toughest outfit in the german army the people at home are interested in you they're curious about your pearl-handle revolvers they're ivory  only a pimp from a new orleans whorehouse      would carry a pearl handle what about your language?when i want it to stick, i give it to them loud and dirty what do your troops feel about that?i don't want these men to love me  i want them to fight for me ernie pyle says you have a secret weapon here: general bradley ernie calls him \"the gi general  \"omar bradley is no secret  he's a damn fine commander man: what's your feeling about montgomery?patton: he's the best general the english have he seems more concerned with not losing than he does about winning he's not aggressive enough, is that correct?look, i've been getting into a lot of trouble lately yesterday, the office told me that my italian prisoners      didn't have enough latrine they didn't know what a latrine was till i showed them if i've said anything too critical of my british colleague      let's forget about it i will tell you one thing, though  off the record i'm gonna beat that      gentleman to messina ah, freddie  do you realize what this madman patton is saying?he's going to save our skins by taking messina this report might interest you here i am in these bloody marshes, fighting malaria and germans      while he's taking palermo and getting all the glory well!now he's up against three good german divisions and he's stuck he's not going to get messina that's reserved for the british 8th army and me (bombs exploding)it's time for a move, lucian  terry allen's 1 st division is bogged down you're bogged down too what we need is another end run just to break things loose - lucian  how's my fighter? - fine, george come in, come in  we need another one of your amphibious specialties lucian, i want you to send a reinforced battalion by sea      to make a landing up here at brolo behind the kraut lines you want me to do a land-based attack right  i want a coordinated attack the morning of the 11 th i don't think we can make it by the 11 th - hell, it's only 15, 20 miles  - my boys have been dying for yards hm maybe you better kick a few butts if you have to i recommended you for your dsm in your last promotion i know what you can do when you put your mind to it excuse me, sir i'm sorry, but i can't do the impossible you're too old an athlete to think you can postpone a scheduled match you're an old athlete yourself  you know matches are postponed if we can't back lucian up by land, our end run could be a disaster those men might get caught on the beach and cut to pieces - what's the matter? bradley: all we're saying is      not to rush in until we're ready give him an extra day just one more day the landing is on we're going to messina we're going to get there before montgomery does - what's so important about that? - general truscott      if your conscience won't permit you to conduct this operation      i'll find somebody who can general, it's your privilege to relieve me anytime you want to this match will not be postponed any questions?no, sir you're a very good man, lucian you want to guard against being too conservative remember what frederick the great said:''l 'audace, i'audace! toujours i'audace!''go on, have a drink excuse me, sir, i won't be drinking for the next couple of days if anything happens to those men, i'd like to be there with them you're not going, so forget about it you believe truscott's right?no but you're gambling with those boys' lives      just to beat montgomery into messina if you pull it off, you're a hero, but if you don't   what happens to them? the ordinary combat soldier he doesn't share in your dreams of glory, he's stuck here he's living out every day, day-to-day, with death tugging at his elbow there's one big difference between you and me, george i do this job because i've been trained to do it you do it because      you love it the men on the beach are catching hell, general the men are doing their best  we have no replacements i can't break through to the coast i'm going down there myself patton: colonel!how did he get over there?patton: what the hell are you waiting for?looking for a place to

wounded men shut up!don't admit this yellow bastard  nothing wrong with him i won't have sons of bitches afraid to fight stink up this place of honor you're going back to the front, my friend you may get shot, you may get killed, but you're going up to the fighting either that or i'll stand you up in front of a firing squad i should shoot you myself, you bastard! get him out of here!send him up to the front!you hear me? you goddamn coward!i won't have cowards in my army i had to kick a few butts      but truscott finally broke through to those people on the beach have you seen the casualty lists?yes, i've seen them what's the word from the coast road?the 3rd division's east of brolo, heading toward messina let's get over there  i want to go in with the troops you go ahead, george  i'm not very good at that general bradley      it's time to consider how many casualties we'd have      if we were still crawling on that goddamn road forward, march!don't smirk, patton  i shan't kiss you pity  i shaved close this morning to prepare for getting smacked by you forward, march!you wanted to see me, george?got a letter here from ike i was rereading caesar's commentaries last night in battle, caesar wore a red robe to distinguish him from his men i was struck by that fact because-\"despicable  \" first time anybody's ever applied that word to me well, at least it's a personal reprimand, it's not official the man was yellow  he should've been tried for cowardice and shot people have taken a lot worse than a little kick in the pants i ruffled his pride a bit  what's that compared to war?two weeks ago at palermo they said i was the greatest general   -    since stonewall jackson  - now they draw cartoons about you dirty bastard!they got me holding a little gl and kicking him with an iron boot you see that, what's on my boot? a swastika on my boot  an iron boot with a swastika!\"you will apologize to the soldier you slapped      to all doctors and nurses

i am as big a son of a bitch as some of you think i am i assure you i had no intention      of being either harsh or cruel in my treatment of the      soldier in question my sole purpose was to try to restore in him      some appreciation of his obligations as a man      and as a soldier if one can shame a coward      i felt one might help him to regain his self-respect this was on my mind now, i freely admit      that my method was wrong      but i hope you understand my motive      and will accept this      explanation      and this      apology - dismissed  - ten-hut!good evening, general  i want to report on a private poll i'm taking what poll?the fan mail eleven percent con, 89 percent pro and that 11 % of protest, in most cases, is both obscene and anonymous but the pro letters are mostly from relatives and servicemen \"i want you to know we're proud our son is serving in your army from the newspaper, we're not clear exactly what you did and why      but we want you to know we're for you keep going, and god bless you  \"keep going, huh?where?i thought you might like a sip of wine, general  it's new year's you didn't celebrate at all last night i'm sick of sitting around

army i don't believe it happy new year just a minute, sir since they're sure to give you another command      isn't it logical they'd relieve you here first?you mean command of all american troops going into europe?it's possible  i know it's been discussed from time to time the logic of it is so obvious, it couldn't mean anything else sir, i'm going to open this bottle of wine no, sir cod      but if you find a bottle of cognac, i'll help you drink it - how you feeling tonight, general? - not bad, not bad at all - get me some writing paper, will you? - yes, sir your wife ever give you the

yeah i just thought you might be feeling kind of low, sir your writing things, sir  here on the desk, sir yeah  thank you, george one little dog face one measly little slap  that's what done it ah, george i wish i'd kissed the son of a bitch (clapping)(patton speaks in french)he's paying tribute to the free french forces under degaulle and leclerc (speaks in french)and to the people of the resistance      who risk their lives to help destroy the germans \"france will be free again  i give you my word  \"\"just as free french troops liberated corsica, napoleon's place of birth      i

suggested      you take over gen  clark's italian campaign      but it was killed due to the incident - no comment  - can you say where you're going, sir?off the record, eisenhower's ordered me to

staff we want to stay with you, no matter what duty you're assigned to up in london, they're planning the invasion of europe i've trained my mind, body and spirit for that what, in god's name, am i

picked this cathouse?i think it was gen  smith, sir to spite me, that son of a bitch - welcome to london, georgie  - bedell  how are you?- is ike here? - he asked me to brief you would you excuse us, please?let me put you straight about ike we hear a lot about you criticizing his decisions not really  you know me  i'm just an old fool at times, i do wonder whether he isn't a limey at heart george, this is the toughest coalition ever attempted in history ike's trying to hold it together and lick the germans at the same time - it's a hell of a job  - i understand you have an important assignment connected to the normandy invasion good  i've studied the overlord plan and there's a number of flaws in it you can't depend on monty taking cannes by d-day  he'll never make it i've drawn up an alternate plan to land at calais   -    following an air bombardment- - will you just listen for a change?ike stood by you when everyone, i mean everyone      wanted patton with a rope around his neck we're gonna let it leak out that you are here undercover that you're preparing to invade at the pas de calais we hope to pin down the german 15th army there      so that they can't be used against us at normandy is that all i'm good for?we're going to build an army of 12 divisions around you all fictitious, of course dummy troop concentrations, dummy landing craft      simulated radio traffic the germans are convinced that you will lead the main invasion effort their agents will spot you soon      then we can move you to knutsford - what do i do there? - nothing  absolutely nothing frankly, george, you're on probation take my advice and behave yourself remember      your worst enemy is your own big mouth (band plays)look at this nasty-faced son of a bitch  ready for combat i'll call him william as in \"the conqueror  \"- sir, should we leave him in the car? - no  good afternoon, ladies good afternoon (willie barks)watch this, cod - sir, he'll kill that dog  - i'll hold him i'm terribly sorry, general  did abigail frighten your dog?that's quite all right, madam this way, sir your name isn't william it's willie woman: my dear friends general george s  patton, jr , has accepted our invitation      to say a few words to you      on the occasion of this inaugural ceremony general patton is not here in an official capacity      and i have assured him most earnestly      that nothing he says will be quoted may i present general patton - remember, sir, watch your language  - yeah my dear ladies until today      my only experience at welcoming has been      to welcome germans and italians to the infernal region at this i have been quite successful      since the troops, which i have had the honor to command      have, to date, killed or captured      some 170,000 of our enemies i feel that such clubs as these are of very real value      because i believe with mr  bernard shaw      that the british and the americans are two peoples      separated by a common language since it is the destiny of the british and americans to rule the world      the better we know each other      the better we will do it the russians, don't forget the russians i think that a club like this      is an ideal place for promoting mutual understanding because as soon as our soldiers meet and get to know the english ladies      and write home and tell our women just how lovely you truly are      then the sooner the american ladies will get jealous      and force this war to a quick termination and then i'll get the chance to go to the pacific and kill japanese narrator: all over the nation      mass meetings are held to protest general patton 's statement       that britain and america will rule the post war world that russia will have no say congressional leaders like senator clayburn foss are quick to react this man has insulted our russian allies      implying anglo-american world rule in my opinion, he should be severely disciplined this time i didn't do a damn thing they promised there wouldn't be any reporters i made a few remarks off the record ike told you to keep your mouth shut you know how suspicious the russians are of the british and us i was only trying to be polite to the old ladies if i'd seen the russians there, i'd have mentioned the sons of bitches bedell, i don't know anything about politics i have no political ambitions all i want to do is to command an army in combat well, it's out of our hands now ike sent a message last night to the chief of staff now it's up to general marshall whether you stay here as a decoy      or he sends you home he's a good man at least he's a fair man i'll let it sit with him patton: george      our war is over over, sir?it's just a question of waiting for the orders now i feel i'm   i'm destined to achieve some great thing  what, i don't know but this last incident is      so trivial in its nature and so terrible in its effect-it can't be an accident  it has to be the work of god yes, sir the last great opportunity of a lifetime      an entire world at war and i'm left out of it?no, sir god will not permit this to happen!i am going to be allowed to fulfil my destiny!his will be done narrator: in the greatest amphibious operation ever attempted      a predawn naval bombardment prepares the way      for allied soldiers to assault the normandy beaches      and claw out a desperate foothold on the continent of europe i knew montgomery couldn't take caen on d-day or d-plus-10  and i said so and here they are all hung up in the hedgerow country they should pivot the way von schlieffen planned it in world war i then we might get a chance to do some real broken field running but they don't listen to me what a way to enter the continent of europe along with all the rest of the spare parts sir, everything on this plane is high priority gen  bradley wouldn't send for you unless he had something in mind i'll tell you, cod  i've learned my lesson if i ever do get another chance, i'm gonna keep my mouth shut i'm gonna play the game if i forget, you remind me - i'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs  - give me a swift kick in the ass yes, sir welcome to france, sir hope the war's still on  where's the boss?right this way, sir patton, haven't seen you since messina how are you?you're doing a splendid job decoying the jerries you'll forgive me, i'm off to the front best of everything, old boy by the way      intelligence confirms that i'm against rommel again rommel hi, how are you, george?- pretty fair, brad  how are you? - fine well  my, my isn't this plush?looks like you're bucking for archbishop chet hansen had this rig built for me  george, sit down ike wanted me to talk to you since we can level with each other that's right we're making 3rd army operational when i take over 12th army group do i get it?i'll be honest with you i've had reservations you've been my senior ever since i left the academy you were the boss in north africa and sicily and i just thought      well, it might be a problem for us it wouldn't bother me there's one other thing we're different kinds of people goddamn it, brad, you're always right with your brains and my screwy ideas, we make a great team, like in sicily truthfully, if i had been your senior in sicily, i would have relieved you brad      i'm not crawling on my belly to get a command for god's sake, get me in this fight the only way out of the doghouse is to do something great i gotta get back in the war!hitler's own people tried to kill him a few days ago first thing you know, it'll be over and   i'll      keep my mouth shut  i'll behave myself i give you my word george      i've been working on a plan called cobra i'd like your opinion we've been slugging through hedgerow country      half an acre a day and we've got to find a way out i want to use this road the saint l\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd-periers road monty will pin down the enemy forces at caen we'll pulverize an area 31/2 miles wide with bombing then seven divisions will follow the 3rd army will swing around here, a sweeping end run right across france what do you think?i think you'll need a screwball old cavalryman to command the 3rd army george      ike came to that conclusion in london three months ago he what?why, that dirty-! i'm sorry  i'm sorry i promise to keep my mouth shut (speaking in german)<font

we're up against new priorities - i think i smell montgomery  - take it easy, george there are serious issues involved  political issues by god, it is montgomery the launching sites for the b-2 bombs are all in his area churchill wants those bases destroyed hitler kills more civilians in london than soldiers expect montgomery to do anything?you give me gasoline and i'll gain ground with it, kill germans too give me 400,000 gallons  i'll go to berlin george, i can't do it the siegfried line is an empty shell they stripped the equipment and sent it east it's crawling with cows  i can punch through in two days there's no use in arguing with me  it wasn't my idea why did you pick me to command?i didn't pick you ike picked you george, you have performed brilliantly you are loyal, dedicated you're one of the best i've got, but you don't know when to shut up george, you're a pain in the neck i have a lot of faults, brad but ingratitude isn't one of them i owe you a lot hell, i know i'm a prima donna  i admit it what i can't stand about monty is, he won't admit it (tank sputters)captain, the bailey's run out of gas the point tank has run out too and there's a kraut column up ahead yeah, i know patton: were you in command here, captain?i was in command my tank platoon was supporting an infantry company tanks ran out of gas, so we had to fight it out we started 11:00 last night finished a couple hours ago this morning the fighting was hand-to-hand i had a dream last night in my dream it came to me      that right now the whole nazi reich is mine for the taking think about that, cod  i was nearly sent home in disgrace now i have precisely the right instrument      at precisely the right moment of history and exactly the right place the saar?this will change too, very quickly like a planet spinning off into the universe a moment like this won't come again for 1000 years all i need is a few miserable gallons of gasoline right now, the weak spot is here in 10 days, we could be in berlin what about the fortifications that were done in metz?fixed fortifications, huh?monuments to the stupidity of man when mountain ranges and oceans could be overcome      anything built by man can be overcome you know how i'm sure they're finished out there?the carts they're using carts to move their wounded and the supplies the carts came to me in my dream  i couldn't figure it out then i remembered      that nightmare in the snow  the agonizing retreat from moscow how cold it was they threw the wounded and what was left of the supplies in the carts napoleon was finished not any color left  not even the red of blood only the snow look at this, cod i love it god help me, i do love it so i love it more than my life narrator: paris is liberated, and french troops lead the way the allies march into the city after four years of nazi occupation the hard-fighting french 2nd armored division      under major general jacques leclerc      gets an unforgettable welcome      as they enter their beloved paris in a powerful drive to the north       general montgomery cuts off and bypasses the french coastal towns      of boulogne, calais and dunkirk pushing on to capture the vital belgian port of antwerp meanwhile, the main body of patton 's army      resupplied now and rolling like a juggernaut, slashes toward the saar nazi resistance appears to crumble it seems that nothing can stop our troops from driving on into germany - sir, general bradley on your line  - good, good brad, listen, i've got a bridgehead across the saar i'm on my way to germany wait a minute, george  there's a lot of trouble up north i want you to transfer tank armor to middleton's 8th corps right away brad, you can't do that george, listen  i don't have time to argue there's a lot of enemy activity up around ardennes no, i don't know how serious it is      but ike wants us to meet with bedell smith tomorrow at verdun be there at 1100 yes, sir patton: there's absolutely no reason for us to assume      that the germans are mounting a major offense the weather is awful and their supplies are low the germans haven't mounted a winter attack since frederick the great therefore i believe that's exactly what they're going to do i want you to start making contingency plans      for pulling out of our eastward attack changing directions 90 degrees, moving up to luxembourg don't look so stunned, gentlemen i want you to plan for three possible axes of attack from diekirch, due north from orl\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdans to bastogne from neufch\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdteau against the german left flank we've identified four german armies:the 7th, the 5th panzer, 6th ss panzer and the 15th they've hit us with 26 divisions they've overran two regimens of the 106th division and 7500 of our men were forced to surrender our concern is that von rundstedt      has the 101 st airborne trapped here at bastogne bastogne, by the way, is the key to this entire area if we can hold it, we can break up the entire german offensive if they take it, we're in serious trouble ike wants to know if anybody can go      and relieve the 101 st before they're torn to pieces there's nothing montgomery can do at any rate, not for some weeks what about you, george?i can attack with three divisions in 48 hours i'd give myself some leeway ike wants a realistic estimate, george you're in the middle of a fight now  it's over a hundred miles to bastogne my staff's already working out the details frankly, i don't see how it's possible not in this kind of weather i should have thought you'd want to fall back and regroup not me  i don't like to pay for the same real estate twice tedder: but what about your men?you can't cart them off 100 miles, expecting them to attack without rest i trained these men they'll do what i tell them to do we hadn't realized you were so popular with your troops, general i'm not  they'll do it because they're good soldiers and because they realize, as i do, that we can still lose this war then i think i can speak for field marshal montgomery he'd say you're asking the impossible of your men of course he would cause he's never realized that's what we're in business for (bomb explodes)general mcauliffe refused a german surrender demand you know what he said?what?he said, \"nuts  \"keep them moving, colonel a man that eloquent has to be saved (silence)this is where it pays off the training and discipline no other outfit in the world pulled out of a winter battle, move a hundred miles going to a major attack with no rest, no sleep, no hot food god! god, i'm proud of these men!sir, von rundstedt's thrown another panzer division against bastogne 101 st airborne's barely holding on we need damned air cover  if we had decent weather, we might make it carver: general mason, sir hello, mase? listen, we're short on foot soldiers cannibalize your antiaircraft units and turn them into riflemen yes, every last one you can find good evening, general i just got the weather report for tomorrow  more snow there goes our air cover we may have to wait for better weather brave men dying up there  i won't wait, not an hour, not a minute going to keep moving is that clear?we're going to attack all night and attack tomorrow morning!if we're not victorious      let no one come back alive you know something, general?sometimes, they can't tell when you're acting and when you're not it isn't important for them to know it's only important for me to know - you want to see me, general? - oh, yeah, chaplain i'm tired of 3rd army having to fight germans      with supreme command, no gasoline      and now this ungodly weather i want a prayer, a weather prayer a weather prayer, sir?yes, let's see if you can't get god working with us gonna take a thick rug for that kind of praying i don't care if it takes a flying carpet i don't know how this will be received, general praying for good weather so we can kill our fellow man i assure you, because of my relations with the almighty      if you write a good prayer, we'll have good weather and i expect that prayer within an hour yes, sir \"almighty and most merciful father      we humbly beseech thee      of thy great goodness      to restrain this immoderate weather      with which we've had to contend grant us fair weather for battle graciously hearken to us      as soldiers who call upon thee       that armed with thy power       we may advance from victory to victory      and crush the oppression      and wickedness of our enemies      and establish thy justice      among men and nations amen

thinks that      you are a son of a bitch too okay  i'll drink to that one son of a bitch to another (speaks in russian)(cheering)is it true that roosevelt, before he died      promised you a command in the pacific?yes  but now that he's gone, i don't think there's much chance of that doug macarthur doesn't want me up there we're told of \"wonder weapons\" the germans were working on:long-range rockets, push-button bombing      weapons that don't need soldiers \"wonder weapon\"?my god, i don't see the wonder in them killing without heroics  nothing is glorified, nothing is reaffirmed no heroes, no cowards, no troops no generals only those that are left alive and those that are left      dead i'm glad i won't live to see it reporter: it's said you're still using former nazis in key positions despite the denazification policy well, if i'm supplied with trained personnel      i'll get rid of the nazis until then, i'll use them to keep the railroads and telephones working after all, didn't most ordinary nazis join the party      in about the same way americans become republicans or democrats?yes, that's about it you agree that national policy be made by civilians, not by the military?of course  but the politicians never let us finish they always stop short and leave us with another war you thinking about our russian allies?did you say if you found your army between the germans and the russians      you'd attack in both directions?no, i never said that i never said any such thing but i wish i had (laughing)sir, there's a call on your line from supreme headquarters, general smith bedell?ike is furious how could you compare republicans and democrats to the nazi party?and the statement that you refuse to denazify      has the russians, the british, everybody, screaming well, the hell with the mongoloid russians we've given them berlin, prague, god knows what else they gonna dictate policy too?george, don't be a fool the war in europe is over  washington dictates policy the war shouldn't be over  we should stop pussyfooting about the russians!we'll have to fight them anyway  why not do it now, when the army's here?instead of disarming germans let's get them to help fight the bolsheviks you better shut up  this line may be tapped i don't care  i'll tell you      we've been fighting the wrong people you and i don't have to get involved, you're so soft about it leave it to me  in 10 days i'll have us at war with them      and make it look like their fault!george, you're mad  you're absolutely out of your mind!well, i'm no diplomat i'm a combat soldier  that's all they understand get ike to give me the word, and i'll kick them back to russia!shall i call the artist back, sir?oh, the hell with it nobody wants to see a picture of me  i'm mad!don't you know that?field marshal montgomery, his majesty is prepared      to receive the next chief of the imperial general staff thank you thank you take care of yourself george well, gentlemen      all good things must come to an end and the best thing that's happened to me      in my life      has been      uh      the honor      and privilege      of commanding the 3rd army goodbye      and god bless you brad      they've taken the 3rd army away from me i know i thought we could have dinner together tonight thank you, brad that's damn thoughtful  i appreciate it right now, i think i'll take willie for a walk george, look out!after all i've been through      imagine getting killed by an oxcart no, brad, there's only one proper way for a professional soldier to die that's from the last bullet of the last battle of the last war at least the 3rd army earned its pay in our drive across europe, we liberated       12,000 cities and towns      and inflicted a million and a half enemy casualties i sense from now on, just being a good soldier won't mean a thing i'm afraid we're gonna have to be diplomats, administrators, you name it god help us george, i want to say one thing you've done a magnificent job here in europe that's right, george that soldier you slapped did more to win the war than any other private i'll see you for dinner six-thirty?patton: for over a thousand

throwed away you couldn't spend it better oh, this is irresistible  let's give 'im ten the missus wouldn't have the 'eart to spend ten, governor ten pounds is a lot o' money makes a man feel prudent-like, and then goodbye to 'appiness no, you just give me what i ask, governor  not a penny less, not a penny more i rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immorality, doolittle why don't you marry that missus of <i>yours</i>after all, marriage isn 't so frightening  you married eliza' s mother who told you that, governor?well, nobody told me  i concluded, naturally   if we listen to this man for another minute we shall have no convictions left - five pounds, i think you said  - thank you, governor are you sure you won't have ten?no  no, perhaps another time i beg your pardon, miss i won't say those ruddy vowels one more time blimey, it's elizawell, i never thought she'd clean up so good-looking she does me credit, don't she, governor?here! what are you doin'

trying to tell you that i want to call of the beti know you're a stubborn man, but so am i this experiment is over and nothing short of an order from the king could force me to recant you understand,

doolittle indeed  i'll bet you that damned gown doesn 't fit i warned you about these french designerswe should have gone to <i>an</i> english shop  they would've been on our side - have a glass of port - no, thank you are you so sure this girl will retain everything you've hammered into her?well, we shall see suppose she doesn 'ti lose my betthere's one thing i can' t stand about you, that 's your confounded complacency at a moment like this, with so much at stake   it's utterly indecent that you don't need a glass of portand what about the girl? you act as though she doesn 't matter at all rubbish, pickering  of course she matterswhat do you think i've been doing all these <i>months</i>what could possibly matter more than to take a human being   and change her into a diferent human being by creating a new speech for her?it's filling up the deepest gap that separates class from class   and soul from soul oh, she matters immensely miss doolittle, you look beautiful thank you,

off</i> <i>and never tell me where i'm going?</i><i>why can't a woman be like me?</i>you mean that after you'd done this wonderful thing for them   without making a mistake   they just sat there and never said a word?never petted you, or admired you, or told you how splendid you'd been?not a word they just congratulated each other on how marvelous they'd been the next moment, how glad they were it was all over   and what a bore it had all been this is simply appalling  i should not have thrown my slippers at him ishould have thrown the fire ironswho's that?henry  i knew it wouldn't be too long now, remember   you not only danced with a prince last night, you behaved like a princess mother, the most confounded thing    do you   you!good afternoon, professor higgins are you quite well?of course you are  you are never ill  would you care for some teadon't you dare try that game on me  itaught it to you get up, come home and stop being a fool you've caused me enough trouble very nicely put indeed, henry  no woman could resist such an invitation how did this baggage get here?<i>eliza came to see me this morning and i was delighted to have her if you don't promise to behave yourself lmust as you to leave you mean, i'm to put on my sunday manners for this   thing that i created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of covent garden?that 's precisely what i meahowever did you learn good manners with my son around?it was very dificult i should never have known how ladies   and gentlemen behave if it hadn't been for colonel pickering he showed me that he felt and thought about me   as if i were something better than a common flower girl you see, mrs higgins, apart from the things one can pick up   the diference between a lady and a flower girl isn 't how she behaves   but how she is treated ishall always be a flower girl to professor higgins   because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will i know i'll always be a lady to colonel pickering   because he always treats me as a lady and always will henry, don't grind your teeth the bishop is here, madam  shall i show him into the garden?the bishop and the professor? good heavens, no!ishould be excommunicated i'll see him in the library <i>eliza, if my son starts breaking up things   i give you full permission to have him evicted henry dear, i suggest you stick to two subjects: the weather and your health you've had a bit of your own back, as you say have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable or do you want any more?you want me back to pick up your slippers   and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you i didn't say i wanted you back at all indeed? then what are we talking aboutwell, about you, not about me if you come back you'll be treated as you've always been i can' t change my nature or my mannersmy manners are exactly the same as colonel pickering'sthat 's not true  he treats a flower girl as if she were a duchess and i treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl oh, i see  the same to everybody you see, the great secret is not a question of good manners   or bad manners or any particular sort of manners   but having the same manner for all human soulsthe question is not whether i treat you rudely   but whether you've ever heard me treat anyone else better i don't care how you treat me i don't mind your swearing at me  ishouldn't mind a black eye i've had one before this but i won't be passed over!get out of my way, for i won't stop for you you talk about me as though i was a motorbusso you are a motorbus all bounce and go and no consideration for anybody but i can get along without you  don't you think i can' ti know you ca i told you, you could you've never wondered, i suppose, whether   whether i could get along without you?don't you try to get around me  you'll have to so i can, without you or any soul on earth ishall miss you, eliza i've learned something from your idiotic notionsi confess that humbly and gratefully well, you have my voice on your gramophone when you feel lonely without me you ca turn it on  it has no feelings to hurtwell, i can' t turn your soul on oh, you are a devil!you can twist the heart in a girl just as easily   as some can twist her arms to hurt her what am i to come back for?for the fun of it that 's why i took you on you may throw me out tomorrow if i don't do everything you want yes and you may walk out tomorrow if i don't do everything you want and live with my father?yes, or sell flowers would you rather marry pickering?i wouldn't marry you if you asked me and you're nearer my age then what he isi'll talk as i like  you're not my teacher now that 's not what i want and don't you think it isi've always had chaps enough wanting me that way freddy hill writes me twice and three times a day  sheets and sheets in short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is, is that itno, i don't that 's not the sort of feeling i want from you i want a little kindness i know i'm a common, ignorant girl, and you're a book-learned gentleman   but i'm not dirt under your feetwhat i done    what i did was not for the taxis and the dresses   but because we were pleasant together and i come to    came   to care for you not to want you to make love to me   and not forgetting the diference between us, but   more friendly like well, of course  that 's how i feel and how pickering feels <i>eliza, you're a fool!that 's not the proper answer it's the only answer till you stop being a idiotif you want to be a lady, you must stop feeling neglected   if the men don't spend half their time sniveling over you   and the other half giving you black eyesyou find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?of with you to the sort of people you like marry a sentimental hog with lots of money   and thick lips to kiss you, and thick boots to kick you if you can' t appreciate what you've got, you'd better get what you can appreciate i can' t talk to you  you always turn everything against me i'm always in the wrong don't be too sure you have me under your feet   to be trampled on and talked down i'll marry freddy, i will, as soon as i'm able to support him that poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy   even if he had the guts to try for itwoman, don't you understand? i have made you a consort for a king!freddy loves me  that makes him king enough for me i don't want him to

on your side, mr  frodo i know, sam  i know trust me come, smeagol what time is it?not yet dawn i dreamed i saw a great wave   climbing over green lands and above the hills i stood upon the brink it was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet a light shone behind me   but i could not turn i could only stand there, waiting night changes many thoughts sleep, eowyn sleep   while you can the stars are veiled something stirs in the east a sleepless malice the eye of the enemy is moving what are you doing?pippin!pippin?pippin - what, are you mad? - i just want to look at it just one more time put it back pippin no!pippin he is here i see you pippin!help! gandalf, help!someone help him!pippin!fool of a took!look at me gandalf, forgive me look at me what did you see?a tree there was a white tree   in a courtyard of stone it was dead the city was burning minas tirith? is that what you saw?i saw   i saw him i could hear his voice in my head and what did you tell him?speak!he asked me my name  i didn't answer he hurt me what did you tell him about frodo and the ring?there was no lie in pippin's eyes a fool   but an honest fool he remains he told sauron nothing of frodo and the ring we've been strangely fortunate pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan sauron moves to strike the city of minas tirith his defeat at helm's deep showed our enemy one thing he knows the heir of elendil has come forth men are not as weak as he supposed there is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him sauron fears this he will not risk the peoples of middle-earth uniting under one banner he will raze minas tirith to the ground   before he sees a king return to the throne of men if the beacons of gondor are lit, rohan must be ready for war tell me   why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?what do we owe gondor?- i will go  - no!- they must be warned  - they will be you must come to minas tirith by another road follow the river  look to the black ships understand this:things are now in motion that cannot be undone i ride for minas tirith   and i won't be going alone of all the inquisitive hobbits, peregrin took, you are the worst hurry! hurry!where are we going?why did you look?why do you always have to look?- i don't know  i can't help it  - you never can i'm sorry, all right?- i won't do it again  - don't you understand?the enemy thinks you have the ring he's going to be looking for you, pip  they have to get you out of here and you   ? you're coming with me?merry?come on how far is minas tirith?three days' ride, as the nazgul flies and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail here something for the road the last of the longbottom leaf i know you've run out  you smoke too much, pippin but    but we'll see each other soon - won't we? - i don't know i don't know what's going to happen - merry  - run, shadowfax show us the meaning of haste merry!merry!he's always followed me   everywhere i went   since before we were tweens i would get him into the worst sort of trouble   but i was always there to get him out now he's gone just like frodo and sam one thing i have learned about hobbits:they're a most hardy folk foolhardy, maybe  he's a took take her by the safest road a ship lies anchored in the grey havens it waits to carry her across the sea the last journey of arwen undomiel there is nothing for you here   only death lady arwen   we cannot delay my lady!- tell me what you have seen  - arwen you have the gift of foresight what did you see?i looked into your future, and i saw death but there is also life you saw there was a child  you saw my son that future is almost gone but it is not lost nothing is certain some things are certain if i leave him now   i will regret it forever it is time from the ashes a fire shall be wokena light from the shadow shall springrenewed shall be blade that was brokenthe crownless again shall be kingre-forge the sword your hands are cold the life of the eldar is leaving you this was my choice whether by your will or not   there is no ship now that can bear me hence we've just passed into the realm of gondor minas tirith city of kings make way!it's the tree gandalf  gandalf yes, the white tree of gondor the tree of the king lord denethor, however, is not king he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne now listen carefully  lord denethor is boromir's father to give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise and do not mention frodo or the ring and say nothing of aragorn either in fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, peregrin took hail denethor, son of ecthelion, lord and steward of gondor i come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel perhaps you come to explain this perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead boromir died to save us   my kinsman and me - he fell defending us from many foes  - pippin i offer you my service, such as it is   in payment of this debt this is my first command to you how did you escape and my son did not   so mighty a man as he was?the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow   and boromir was pierced by many get up my lord, there will be a time to grieve for boromir   but it is not now war is coming the enemy is on your doorstep  as steward, you are charged   with the defense of this city  where are gondor's armies?you still have friends  you are not alone in this fight send word to theoden of rohan  light the beacons you think you are wise, mithrandir yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom do you think the eyes of the white tower are blind?i have seen more than you know with your left hand you would use me as a shield against mordor and with your right you'd seek to supplant me i know who rides with theoden of rohan oh, yes  word has reached my ears of this aragorn, son of arathorn and i tell you now, i will not bow to this ranger from the north   last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward the rule of gondor is mine and no other's come all has turned to vain ambition he would even use his grief as a cloak a thousand years this city has stood now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall and the white tree, the tree of the king   will never bloom again - why are they still guarding it? - they guard it because they have hope a faint and fading hope that one day it will flower that a king will come and this city will be as it once was   before it fell into decay the old wisdom borne out of the west was forsaken kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living   and counted the old names of their descent   dearer than the names of their sons childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry   or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars and so the people of gondor fell into ruin the line of kings failed the white tree withered the rule of gondor was given over to lesser men mordor yes, there it lies this city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow a storm is coming this is not the weather of the world this is a device of sauron's making a broil of fume he sends ahead of his host the orcs of mordor have no love of daylight   so he covers the face of the sun   to ease their passage along the road to war when the shadow of mordor reaches this city   it will begin well   minas tirith   very impressive - so where are we off to next? - oh, it's too late for that, peregrin there's no leaving this city help must come to us it must be getting near teatime leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime we're not in decent places mr  frodo?what is it?it's just a feeling i don't think i'll be coming back yes, you will  of course you will that's just morbid thinking we're going there and back again   just like mr  bilbo you'll see i think these lands were once part of the kingdom of gondor long ago, when there was a king mr  frodo, look the king has got a crown again come on, hobbits! mustn't stop now  this way so i imagine this is just a ceremonial position i mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting - do they? - you're in the service of the steward now you'll have to do as you're told, peregrin took ridiculous hobbit guard of the citadel thank you there's no more stars is it time?yes it's so quiet it's the deep breath before the plunge i don't want to be in a battle   but waiting on the edge of one i can't escape is even worse is there any hope, gandalf, for frodo and sam?there never was much hope just a fool's hope our enemy is ready his full strength's gathered not only orcs, but men as well legions of haradrim from the south   mercenaries from the coast all will answer mordor's call come on this will be the end of gondor as we know it here the hammer stroke will fall hardest if the river is taken, if the garrison at osgiliath falls   the last defense of this city will be gone but we have the white wizard  that's got to count for something gandalf?sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant   the one who will lead mordor's armies in war the one they say no living man can kill the witch king of angmar you've met him before he stabbed frodo on weathertop he is the lord of the nazgul   the greatest of the nine minas morgul is his lair the dead city very nasty place  full of enemies quick  quick they will see  they will see come away  come away  look, we have found it the way into mordor the secret stair climb - no, mr  frodo! - not that way!- what's it doing? - no - they're calling me  - no hide! hide!i can feel his blade we come to it at last the great battle of our time come away, hobbits  we climb  we must climb the board is set the pieces are moving up, up, up the stairs we go and then it's into the tunnel hey, what's in this tunnel?you listen to me, and you listen good and proper anything happens to him, you have me to answer to one sniff something's not right   one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over no more slinker  no more stinker you're gone  got it?i'm watching you what was that about?nothing  just clearing something up peregrin took, my lad, there is a task now to be done another opportunity for one of the shire-folk to prove their great worth you must not fail me it's been very quiet across the river the orcs are lying low the garrison may have moved out we've sent scouts to cair andros if the orcs attack from the north, we'll have some warning quiet we need 10 more kill him!they're not coming from the north to the river  quick  quick  go  come on faster draw swords hold! hold them!what?amon dinthe beacon  the beacon of amon din is lit hope is kindled the beacons of minas tirith! the beacons are lit!gondor calls for aid and rohan will answer muster the rohirrim assemble the army at dunharrow as many men as can be found  you have two days on the third, we ride for gondor and war - forward  - very good, sir - gamling  - my lord make haste across the riddermark summon every able-bodied man to dunharrow i will - will you ride with us? - just to the encampment it's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men the men have found their captain they will follow you into battle, even to death you have given us hope excuse me i have a sword please accept it i offer you my service, theoden king and gladly i accept it you shall be meriadoc, esquire of rohan horse-men i wish i could muster a legion of dwarves, fully armed and filthy your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war i fear war already marches on their own lands so it is before the walls of minas tirith   the doom of our time will be decided now is the hour  riders of rohan, oaths you have taken now, fulfill them all  to lord and land!faramir!we can't hold them  the city is lost tell the men to break cover  we ride for minas tirith nazgul take cover!nazgul!fall back  fall back to minas tirith!fall back!- retreat! retreat! - run for your lives!the age of men is over the time of the orc has come - keep going  - it's the nazgul take cover, my lord!it's coming!- it's mithrandir  - the white rider!pull!mithrandir they broke through our defenses they've taken the bridge and the west bank - battalions of orcs are crossing the river  - it is as the lord denethor predicted - long has he foreseen this doom  - foreseen and done nothing faramir?this is not the first halfling to have crossed your path no you've seen frodo and sam?- where? when? - in ithilien not two days ago gandalf, they're taking the road to the morgul vale and then the pass of cirith ungol what does that mean?- what's wrong? - faramir, tell me everything tell me all you know this is how you would serve your city?you would risk its utter ruin?i did what i judged to be right what you judged to be right you sent the ring of power into mordor in the hands of a witless halfling it should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe hidden dark and deep in the vaults   not to be used unless at the uttermost end of need i would not use the ring not if minas tirith were falling in ruin and i alone could save her ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious   as a king of old boromir would have remembered his father's need he would have brought me a kingly gift boromir would not have brought the ring he would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it  he would've fallen - you know nothing of this matter! - he would have kept it for his own and when he returned   you would not have known your son boromir was loyal to me!not some wizard's pupil!father?my son leave me careful, master  careful very far to fall very dangerous are the stairs come, master come to smeagol mr  frodo get back, you!don't touch him!why does he hates poor smeagol?what has smeagol ever done to him?master?master carries heavy burden smeagol knows  heavy, heavy burden fat one cannot know smeagol look after master he wants it he needs it  smeagol sees it in his eye very soon he will ask you for it  you will see the fat one will take it from you send forth all legions do not stop the attack until the city is taken slay them all - what of the wizard? - i will break him where are theoden's riders?will rohan's army come?mithrandir courage is the best defense that you have now what were you thinking, peregrin took?what service can a hobbit offer such a great lord of men?it was well-done a generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel you are to join the tower guard i didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me once belonged to a young boy of the city a very foolish one   who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies - this was yours? - yes, it was mine my father had it made for me well   i'm taller than you were then though i'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways never fitted me either boromir was always the soldier they were so alike, he and my father proud stubborn even but strong i think you have strength of a different kind and one day your father will see it here do i swear fealty and service to gondor   in peace or war   in living or dying   from   from this hour henceforth   until my lord release me   or death take me and i shall not forget it   nor fail to reward that which is given fealty with love valor with honor disloyalty with vengeance i do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses   defenses that your brother long held intact - what would you have me do? - i will not yield   the river in pelennor unfought osgiliath must be retaken my lord, osgiliath is overrun much must be risked in war is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?you wish now that our places had been exchanged   that i had died and boromir had lived yes i wish that since you were robbed of boromir   i will do what i can in his stead if i should return, think better of me, father that will depend on the manner of your return what are you up to?sneaking off, are we?sneaking?sneaking?fat hobbit is always so polite smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find   and they say \"sneak \"sneak?very nice friend  oh, yes, my precious - very nice, very nice  - all right  all right!you just startled me is all what were you doing?sneaking fine  have it your own way i'm sorry to wake you, mr  frodo we have to be moving on

lying rat! what did you do with it?!he doesn't eat it - he can't have taken it  - look what's this?crumbs on his jacketses  he took it!he took it i seen him  he's always stuffing his face when master's not looking that's a filthy lie!you stinking, two-faced sneak!- sam! - call me   stop it!sam!- i'll kill him! - sam! no!oh, my    i'm sorry  i didn't mean it to go so far  i was just so    so angry here, just    let's just rest a bit - i'm all right  - no no, you're not all right  you're exhausted it's that gollum it's this place it's that thing around your neck i could help a bit i could carry it for a while carry it for a while i could carry it    i could carry it share the load    share the load    the load    the load get away!i don't want to keep it i just want to help see? see?he

life to defend her beauty   her memory, her wisdom your father loves you, faramir he will remember it before the end can you sing, master hobbit?well   yes at least, well enough for my own people but we have no songs for great halls   and evil times and why should your songs be unfit for my halls?come, sing me a song home is behindthe world aheadand there are many paths to treadthrough shadowto the edge of nightuntil the stars are all alightmist and shadowcloud and shadeall shall fadeall shallfademarch! march!march! march! march!make way for the king make way the king is here my lord hail to you, sire grimbold, how many?i bring 500 men from the westfold, my lord we have 300 more from fenmarch, theoden king - where are the riders from snowborn? - none have come, my lord six thousand spears less than half of what i'd hoped for six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of mordor more will come every hour lost hastens gondor's defeat we have till dawn, then we must ride the horses are restless   and the men are quiet they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain that road there   where does that lead?it is the road to the dimholt, the door under the mountain none who venture there ever return that mountain is evil aragorn let's find some food there a true esquire of rohan i'm ready sorry it isn't all that dangerous it's not even sharp well, that's no good  you won't kill many orcs with a blunt blade come on to the smithy  go!you should not encourage him you should not doubt him i do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm why should merry be left behind?he has as much cause to go to war as you why can he not fight for those he loves?you know as little of war as that hobbit when the fear takes him   and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold   do you think he would stand and fight?he would flee and he would be right to do so war is the province of men, eowyn i choose a mortal life i wish i could've seen him   one last time sir?king theoden awaits you, my lord i take my leave my lord elrond i come on behalf of one whom i love arwen is dying she will not long survive the evil that now spreads from mordor the light of the evenstar is failing as sauron's power grows, her strength wanes arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the ring the shadow is upon us, aragorn the end has come it will not be our end, but his you ride to war, but not to victory sauron's armies march on minas tirith, this you know but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river a fleet of corsair ships sails from the south they'll be in the city in two days you're outnumbered, aragorn you need more men there are none there are those who dwell in the mountain murderers   traitors you would call upon them to fight?they believe in nothing they answer to no one they will answer to the king of gondor anduril, the flame of the west, forged from the shards of narsil sauron will not have forgotten the sword of elendil the blade that was broken shall return to minas tirith the man who can wield the power of this sword   can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth put aside the ranger become who you were born to be take the dimholt road i give hope to men i keep none for myself why are you doing this?the war lies to the east  you cannot leave on the eve of battle you cannot abandon the men eowyn   we need you here why have you come?do you not know?it is but a shadow and a thought that you love i cannot give you what you seek i have wished you joy since first i saw you just where do you think you're off to?not this time this time you must stay, gimli have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?you might as well accept it  we're going with you, laddie - what's happening? - where is he going?where's he going?i don't understand lord aragorn!why does he leave on the eve of battle?he leaves because there is no hope he leaves because he must too few have come we cannot defeat the armies of mordor no   we cannot but we will meet them in battle nonetheless i have left instruction the people are to follow your rule in my stead take up my seat in the golden hall long may you defend edoras   if the battle goes ill what other duty would you have me do, my lord?duty?no i would have you smile again   not grieve for those whose time has come you shall live to see these days renewed   and no more despair what kind of army would linger in such a place?one that is cursed long ago, the men of the mountains swore an oath   to the last king of gondor   to come to his aid   to fight but when the time came   when gondor's need was dire   they fled   vanishing into the darkness of the mountain and so isildur cursed them   never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge who shall call them from the grey twilight?the forgotten people the heir of him to whom the oath they swore from the north shall he come need shall drive him he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away the way is shut it was made by those who are dead and the dead keep it the way is shut brego!i do not fear death well, this is a thing unheard-of an elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not?oh oh, i'd never hear the end of it we must ride light and swift it is a long road ahead and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight little hobbits do not belong in war, master meriadoc all my friends have gone to battle i would be ashamed to be left behind it is a three-day gallop to minas tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burden i want to fight i will say no more ride with me my lady form up! move out!form up! move out!ride!ride now to gondor!what is it?what do you see?i see shapes of men and of horses where?pale banners like shreds of cloud spears rise   like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist the dead are following they have been summoned the dead?summoned?i knew that very good very good! legolas!do not look down who enters my domain?one who will have your allegiance the dead do not suffer the living to pass you will suffer me the way is shut it was made by those who are dead and the dead keep it

i thought i'd lost you so i took it only for safekeeping give it to me give me the ring, sam sam give me the ring you must understand the ring is my burden it will destroy you, sam come on, mr  frodo we best find you some clothes you can't go walking through mordor in naught but your skin we did it, mr  frodo we made it to mordor there are so many of them we'll never get through unseen it's him, the eye we have to go in there, mr  frodo there's nothing for it come on  let's just make it down the hill for starters frodo has passed beyond my sight the darkness is deepening if sauron had the ring, we would know it it's only a matter of time he has suffered a defeat, yes but   behind the walls of mordor, our enemy is regrouping let him stay there let him rot! why should we care?because 10,000 orcs now stand between frodo and mount doom i've sent him to his death no there is still hope for frodo he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth - we can give him that  - how?draw out sauron's armies empty his lands then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate we cannot achieve victory through strength of arms not for ourselves but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron's eye fixed upon us keep him blind to all else that moves a diversion certainty of death   small chance of success   what are we waiting for?sauron will suspect a trap he will not take the bait oh, i think he will long have you hunted me long have i eluded you no more behold the sword of elendil the city has fallen silent there is no warmth left in the sun it grows so cold it's just the damp of the first spring rain i do not believe this darkness will endure look, the orcs   they're moving off you see, mr  frodo   some luck at last move it, you slugs!come on! faster!come along, you coldhearted wretched scum   i'll whip you down to the bone, you   come on!what have i told you?no evation   now move it!get up!come on, you slugs!you two are going straight to

  i can't manage the ring, sam it's    it's   it's such a weight to carry it's   such a weight we're going that way  straight as we can there's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need mr  frodo look there is light   and beauty up there   that no shadow can touch take mine there's a few drops left there will be none left for the return journey i don't think there will be a return journey, mr  frodo frodo, get down!hide!frodo!where are they?let the lord of the black land come forth!let justice be done upon him!my master, sauron the great, bids thee welcome is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?we do not come to treat with sauron   faithless and accursed tell your master this: the armies of mordor must disband he is to depart these lands, never to return old greybeard i have a token i was bidden to show thee frodo frodo - silence  - no!silence!the halfling was dear to thee, i see know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?and he did, gandalf he did and who is this?isildur's heir?it takes more to make a king than a broken elvish blade i guess that concludes negotiations i do not believe it i will not pull back pull back!it's gone, mr  frodo the light's passed on, away towards the north something's drawn its gaze hold your ground! hold your ground sons of gondor, of rohan, my brothers!i see in your eyes   the same fear that would take the heart of me a day may come when the courage of men fails   when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship but it is not this day an hour of wolves and shattered shields   when the age of men comes crashing down but it is not this day this day we fight!by all that you hold dear on this good earth   i bid you stand, men of the west!never thought i'd die fighting side by side with an elf what about side by side with a friend?aye i could do that do you remember the shire, mr  frodo?it'll be spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket and they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields   and eating the first of the strawberries with cream do you remember the taste of strawberries?no, sam i can't recall the taste of food   nor the sound of water   nor the touch of grass i'm   naked in the dark there's    there's nothing no veil between me and the wheel of fire i can see him   with my waking eyes then let us be rid of it   once and for all come on, mr  frodo i can't carry it for you   but i can carry you come on!aragorn elessar for

fireworks the lights in the party tree rosie cotton dancing she had ribbons in her hair if ever i was to marry someone   it would've been her it would've been her i'm glad to be with you, samwise

accorded you a special honor   a place on the last ship to leave middle-earth frodo   any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again?the one i gave you i'm sorry, uncle i'm afraid i lost it oh pity

sea calls us home )i think i'm   quite ready for another adventure farewell   my brave hobbits my work is now finished here at last, on the shores of the sea   comes the end of our fellowship i will not say, \"do not weep\"   for not all tears are an evil it is time, frodo what does he mean?we set out to save the shire, sam and it has been saved but not for me you don't mean that you can't leave

man i came by to make it as clear as i possibly canthat i do not want that negro officer taken off this case negro officer?yeah, well, he, uh    he comes from up north, you see and he was, uh, kinda   - passin' through    - if it wasn't for him,your impartial chief of police would still have the wrong man behind bars i want that officer given a free hand otherwise, i will pack up my husband's engineers   and leave you   to yourselves mrs  colbert, now don't you worry about a thing believe me, we're gonna take care of everything bill?i wanna see you come through this now, you hear?even if we have to step on endicott's toes?even that but do it fast all right now, bill, how about this here negro officer?mrs  colbert seems to have confidence in him oh, he ain't nothin'  some kind of a   some kind of a homicide expert  but i don't need him you mean you don't want him  but you do need him now look, bill  suppose he turns up the killer he has no police power here  he's gonna have to hand him over on a platter, right?that's right and if he fails, you're off the hook,'cause it was mrs  colbert's idea in the first place see what i mean?oh, yeah works out all the way around, bill  for all of us excuse me any reason why you have to leave today?there's lots of reasons what would you say if i asked you to stay for a while?no this town needs a factory, virgil colbert come down from chicago to build it i hear they're gonna hire a thousand men  half of them'd be colored - know what that means? - probably got him killed that's what mrs  colbert thinks  she wants us to catch her a killer no killer, no factory well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta colored people  you follow me?- i'm going home, man  - they're your people not mine    yours  you made this scene - what do you want me

unless you could put us all to shame you wanna know something, virgil?i don't think that you could let an opportunity like that pass by jess?jess, this is, uh   this is virgil  he's workin' for me

root fern root? oh, is mr  endicott here?yes, sir  he's out in the greenhouse  would you follow me, please?- gillespie  - mr  endicott this here's virgil - mr  tibbs  - how do you do, sir?oh, may i have henry fetch you somethin'? some light refreshment?- no, thank you  we're all right    - i'll have something cold, soft  anything henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade  i'll have one, too yes, sir i didn't know it was possible to grow this species locally - oh, you like flowers? - i do mr  tibbs, do you know anything about orchids?- not very much, but i do like them  - well, let me show you endicott's folly - what do you think? - it's beautiful  it's breathtaking have you a favorite, mr  tibbs?well, i'm partial to any of the epiphytics why, isn't that remarkable!that of all the orchids in this place, you should prefer the epiphytics i wonder if you know why maybe it would be helpful if you'd tell me because, like the negro,they need care and feedin' and cultivatin' and that takes time that's somethin' you can't make some people understand that's somethin' mr  colbert didn't realize is this what the epiphytics root in?my point! they thrive on it take it away from them, they do poorly - what do you call this material? - that's osmunda  fern root well, we don't wanna take any more of your time, mr  endicott why'd you two come here?to ask you about mr  colbert let me understand this you two came here    to question me?well, your   your attitudes, mr  endicott,your points of view, are a matter of record some people    let us say the people who work for mr  colbert   might reasonably regard you as the person least likely to mourn his passing we were just trying to clarify some of the evidence was mr  colbert ever in this greenhouse? say, last night, about midnight?gillespie?yeah?- you saw it  - oh, i saw it what are you gonna do about it?i don't know i'll remember that there was a time    when i could have had you shot - you better clear out  and i mean fast! - what about that speech you gave me?i didn't know you'd slap any white man! least of all endicott!all right  give me another day  two days  i'm close i can pull that fat cat down  i can bring him right off this hill!oh, boy man, you're just like the rest of us ain't ya?it's all my fault but there's no point in ducking it it's gonna be tough to keep you in your job now now look bill

i'm in a hurry well, we'll see he's had an account with us for several years now that so?not a large account never more than    yeah $208 that was back in '62  september i am not interested in '62 september  i am interested in yesterday yesterday? well   well according to this, he made a deposit of    $632 - yesterday? - yes - thank you  - must have been when i was out to lunch a deposit that size, i'd remember oh, you'll send me that letter for the file, you hear?i'll tell you, baby brother, the chief didn't like him, not even from the first - morning  - where do you think you're goin'?it's all right  let him go i just talked to the fbi lab  we can prove colbert was in that greenhouse endicott's covering up i'm afraid you're too late  we already got the guilty man - who? - sam - sam? - that's right our man is endicott you just think a minute  didn't you catch sam in a lie last night?and yesterday he makes a big cash deposit at the bank if i told you once, i told you a hundred timesthat i won that matchin' quarters and halves  it took me three years!then why was it in big bills? i checked because whenever i got enough change, i'd trade it in on $20 bills and when i got up to $600, i took it down and put it in the bank the day colbert was killed, he cashed a check for $900, $600 of which is gone,$300 of which i believe you left in the wallet as bait for some kid like oberst!- what kinda man do you think i am?! - now, don't you push me, boy!now listen if you weren't suspicious of sam here,why did you question him last night when he changed his route?- i knew why he changed his route  - knew what?he was afraid i'd see some naked white girl down the block - what? - some girl named delores purdy she parades around in the nude at night to get her kicks  that's   - how do you know? - i know well, i know  do you understand?i know that colbert cashed a check for $900 i know that sam made a big cash deposit i know that you caught him in a lie  and i know that's enough for me c'mon, sam martin, lock him up well?well    you're making a mistake don't you bet against it you can catch your train now, virgil tibbs?do you think sam did it?- where do i find the chief? - what's it all about?my business hey, look, purdy now, you got a complaint? well, right here's where you file it what i got to say, i say to the chief it's about sam wood all right <i>yeah?</i>purdy's out here, sir  it's about sam all right  send him in she is gonna have a baby  sam wood's baby well, ask her yourself if you don't believe me!what are you doin' here?it's important that i hear this i ain't talkin' about this with him in the room - boy, you don't want trouble, you get! - you be sensible  i'm a police officer you gonna get him outta here, or do i gotta do it?!you

know how hot it's been  - yeah nights, they aren't any better my brother works nights he leaves me all alone this particular night, i go out on the porch i'm thinkin' how nice it'd be if i had a fountain drink sam comes down our road just like he comes every night passin' like a lord in that fine, big, shiny car only, this time he stops he's got a nice face, don't you think, chief?so he stopped -  he says    - what? i didn't hear what you said <i>he says   </i>\"hey, little girl,you know what the coolest spot in town is?\"and i said \"no, sam  i guess i don't \"and he said    \"the cemetery  that's where \"\"know why?\"\u00e2\u0080\u009ccause they got all of them big, cool tombstones \"\"ever stretch out on a tombstone, delores?\"\"feel all that nice, cool marble along your

they get a little bit outta line?come on now  is that what you're tryin' to say?come on, girl! is it or ain't it?- yeah, they went too far! - well, fine!now, i got one more question  very important

his wife made him uneasy      because she drew stares from men on the street -is that correct, mr  harding? -yes  uh, yes  that's correct he also thinks he may have given her reason      to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he wasn't abie to say how mr  harding has been heard to say to his wife:\"i hate you  i don't ever want to see you again you've betrayed me \"so does anyone care to

because she doesn't meet your mental requirements?hardlng: perhaps, but you see, the only thing i can really      speculate on, nurse ratched      is the very existence of my life, with or without my

what people are saying?people are saying that god himself had a hand      in this schoolhouse business that god stepped in on willie stark's side yes, sir  he does work in mysterious ways sometimes sometimes      he has somebody else do it sends over a fat man in a striped suit with a big car to do his will well, i have had some worse employers, i admit that what you want?well, i wanna work for you, mr  stark and you wanna work for the people, unless i been misinformed people vote me, i'd be privileged to serve them - what, as the county treasurer? - yes, sir mr  stark, you could run for mayor of mason city      and you could win without climbing out of bed in the morning you just put the word out      about willie stark, who tried to take on the crooks single-handed      willie stark, who tried to warn us      willie stark, who could have saved our kids if we'd have just listened now, i'm not talking about willie stark for the mayor of mason city  no, sir i'm talking about willie stark      as the next governor of the great state of louisiana now, you saw a man holding out a handful of cash to you      and you said no this is what i see i see a man in a booth      iooking down at a ballot, a working man and he sees three names there: harrison, macmurphy and stark now, what this man really sees      is that picture in the newspaper of them three little coffins      and the one man since the great governor stanton died      that had the guts to buck the powers that killed them now, that man, that voting man, he's got a pencil      he checks a box, you wake up governor and that little lady lying beside you      the one that don't favor liquor      she wakes up the governor's wife that's what i see now, why don't you take a minute with your orange pop      see if you can't see it too      governor you got your speech?all right willie stark!thank you, folks thank you kindly my name's willie stark from mason city yonder      and i'm pleased to have a chance to talk with you all here today now, friends      what i wanna talk about is something that's been troubling me - coffee, please  - yes, ma'am can i sit with you?or anything else no, thanks - you don't like my looks? - i don't care about anybody's looks      but i can't recall ever going for anyone      who reminds me of a box of spilled spaghetti miss burke, i'm sitting here having a cup of coffee i'm almost through, then you couldn't sit with me      which is what you asked for  - sorry not working for sen-sen puckett anymore - now, he wasn't a bad-iooking fellow  - heel well, sure, politically and elsewise who didn't know that?i guess i'm slower on some things than others - like you  - am i?- i think so  - i think not not on this charade that's the topic of the interview then tell me, if you're so smart all right  harrison's a city man, macmurphy's a cracker not a cracker precisely, but enough of one to worry harrison      that crackers won't know the difference so harrison looks for someone to split the cracker vote hears about an honest man up in crackerville      where some cracker kids go down with a fire escape      that was supposed to be stuck with more than spit to their schoolhouse sends his man tiny duffy up there to romance him      and then sadie burke to romance him some more both telling him how good he is      how he has better than a chance in hell to change things in this state      where nothing will ever change because you and tiny and the rest of them      don't care how much of a fool you make a man and you do care, i suppose?i didn't say that  i don't care if i did, i'd do something about it, wouldn't i?no, i'd rather watch from here like passing a car crash i know you all can't see this from all the way back there      but i've got a pie chart representing it and you can see here where public welfare and hospitals end up they should be the same rather, the ratio     we should go not yet let's go in again you don't wanna swim?how you think we doing?fine, i guess you think?that how you reporting it?sure seems to me they listen less and less the further i get from home well, that makes sense, don't you think?maybe      you trying to say too much i'm telling them what they need to know:taxes, wages, highways well, maybe it's how you're telling them maybe if you told them the way you tell lucy or tiny or me      or anyone face to face, they'd listen better i don't know how that is hard to know how you sound to somebody else mad, fed up, like you mean business is how you sound but not on the platform  you climb three steps      you sound like the rest of them  like a man who wants to win an election willie     yeah?what?nothing well, a man don't have to be governor i don't deny wanting it i won't lie to you, i lie awake wanting it but sometimes a man can want something so bad      be so full of want      he plain forget what it is he want i could have been a good governor a lot better than them other fellas but i ain't gonna be governor hi come on in  why not?oh, mr  stark sadie what's up?willie here was just telling me how he's not gonna be governor you told him?no, i didn't, as a matter of fact, no told me what?told me what?oh, yeah, well, that makes sense i see so that's true? i'm being used so they tell me i saw it in his eyes the first time he come to see me, tiny but i just pushed it out of my head pushed it clean out i should've known better mr  stark?mr  stark?you thought you were the little white lamb of god, didn't you?just waiting for the chance to stand on your hind legs and make a speech they would have paid you to play the part  they pay me but you were too stupid to see even that you did it for free you're just their dumb sacrificial sap and i'm     i'm sorry i let them your stomachaches, your colics, your bloats, your diarrhea you're looking a little peaked i can't imagine slept like a baby got your speech?all right, then  let's go  it's time \"hail, hail, the gang's all here \"what?the song yeah  that's what it is hello  hello how are you?here's that speech you was just asking about my name is willie stark from mason city yonder i had a speech      about this state and what it needs there's no use in me telling you about it, you are the state you know what you need look at the knees of your pants look at your crops look at your kids you got holes and rot      and ignorant offspring on account of this state well, i had a speech, but i ain't got it no more mr  duffy got it now in his fat little hands don't you, tiny?go ahead, show the people  hold it up well, since he got it      i'm gonna have to say something else it's all right because i got something else to say i got a story about a redneck hick he's like yourselves, if you please well, this fella, a while back, this hick      started thinking about all the other hicks      what he could do for them well, one day      it came down with the powerful force      of god's own hand      when the only brick schoolhouse ever built in his parish      collapsed on account of it was built with politics-rotted brick and it killed and mangled a batch of poor, young scholars oh, you know this story you heard it he fought the politics that built that schoolhouse      with rotten brick and bolts but he lost he lost and it fell it fell well, it wasn't long      before some public officials from the city      rode out in their big fine car      and told this hick how they wanted him to run for governor them in them striped pants, they told me      macmurphy was a limberback      joe harrison, he was just a tool of the city machine and they wanted this nobody, do-gooder hick      to step in, give them some honest government you know who they were?in that big fine car?they was joe harrison's own lickspittles      coming in to split macmurphy's hick vote!that's right! your hick vote!there he is!there he is right there there's the judas iscariot lickspittle nose-wiper from

him lie!let that hog lie in his own filth!let him lie, but listen to me, you hicks that's right, i'm not the only one here  you hicks too they fooled you, too, just like they fooled me a thousand times but it's time i fooled somebody it's time i fooled them them big-city, striped-pants lickspittle hick-haters i'm running for governor on my own i'm coming for them and i'm coming for blood!first thing i'm gonna do is build me a road out      across the swamps and alligators and anything else that gets in my way a thousand miles of concrete, if that's what it takes      so i can come out here and visit with my fellow hicks on a regular basis then i'm gonna build me a bridge across that mighty mississippi name it after myself because i'm the one who built it then i'm gonna build you all new schools send your kids home with free tablets and pencils and books      to study and learn on the way to the new university i'm gonna build      where every one of them can go same as rich folks' kids now, i hope you're listening, you hicks because i don't wanna drive all the way back home      just to drive back out here next week to tell you again and this is it:if you don't vote      you don't matter  you don't matter!you don't matter!and then you're just as ignorant as them in the city say you are      while they stealing food off your table      and every nickel out your pocket, saying, \"thank you \"because then you are just a bunch of ignorant hicks who got nothing      because you deserve nothing so listen to me listen here lift your eyes      and look on the god's blessed and unflyblown truth:you are a hick and ain't nobody never helped a hick but a hick hisself it's up to you to nail these parasites up - up to you and me and god  - amen!- nail up joe harrison! - nail

brilliant record as an administrator      and high integrity as a statesman why can't you put that in your column, a little less of stark's raving madness?listen, jack  i know stark's a friend of yours but--he's not a friend of mine  personally, i don't care who's governor are you telling me what to write, or am i mistaken?<i>- you know the chronicle line  - all right </i>what do you mean, \"all right\"?i mean it the way i said it i, willie stark, do solemnly swear      that i will support the constitution and laws of the state of louisiana <i>willie didn't need me to get himself elected </i><i>he won by a landslide </i><i>by the biggest margin in the history of the state </i>- all the duties incumbent upon me as governor so help me god <i>which isn't to say everyone voted for

promises to the poor   </i><i>    to build roads and bridges and schools   </i><i>    were a declaration of war on the rich </i><i>they wanted him out </i>you jack burden?i've come at the behest of the boss who?the boss? the governor?governor, let me put it in simple words so you understand:there's no money for all these things you wanna do for the poor oh, there's money, senator you're wrong there  there's plenty of money every kilowatt comes out of the river, every barrel of oil from the ground but that doesn't belong to you, sir that's right  don't belong to you either or them  belongs to the state how about the state don't tax just 5% to build my roads, we take it all?these are some powerful companies you talking about taking money from - they ain't gonna stand for it  - they ain't the power the power's in the hands of the powerless      and those hands have handed it to me realistically, they'll approve half the money, maybe and that's after we beat them up so we build them half a highway mile of concrete, mile of dirt, mile of concrete, mile of dirt      all the way to shreveport now, how's anybody gonna drive on that?people ain't gonna stand for that they like their roads finished that's right what's right?hey, jack  sadie, take tiny out of here, explain it to him - he just said it and he don't get it  - come on, tiny - you want something to eat? - no, thank you - well, sit down  - hi, sadie hey i heard you got fired oh, you heard wrong  i quit that's smart  when i get done with that outfit, they won't be able to pay you      nor the nigra who sweeps the floor - you want a job? - working for whom?- the state? - hell, no me you, me, sadie, tiny tiny? i was surprised to hear tiny was back well, somebody gotta be lieutenant governor yeah, sure i keep tiny around      to remind me of something i never wanna forget and that is?when they come around sweet-talking, don't listen never again what would i be doing for you?sweet-talking all right,

fella giving away the state  free this, free that, free the other every wool-hat jackass thinking the world is free who's gonna pay? that's what i wanna know who's he think's gonna pay?standard oil and the utility companies, i imagine and anyone else that can afford to pay their share you and me, george  we'll pay government's committed these days      giving services we never heard of back when and he's gonna tax this state to death  drive business right out you don't think it boils down to this:if the government, for quite a long time now      had done anything for the people      they wouldn't have got fed up and elected mr  stark well, you ask him this next time you see him:ask him how much grabbing there is, all that money flowing then you ask him what's he gonna do when they impeach him there's a constitution in this state      or was, before he blew it to hell - i'll be sure to ask him  - you do that jack, miss dumonde plays the piano that's nice you weren't like yourself today, son, like you used to be mother, if i'm ever like i used to be, do me a favor and shoot me who was that at lunch anyway?mr  peyton  you've known him all your life he builds electrical plants or some such the girl, mother  miss dumonde that's mr  orton's sister's child and she will inherit his money somebody ought to wait until she inherits it, then marry her      and drown her in her bathtub oh, don't worry, i'd like to drown her but i won't was mr  peyton saying those people you're with      are mixed up in some sort of graft?graft's what you call it when who's doing it      doesn't know which fork to use  - well, whatever you call it - because i worry to think that-- - i don't know how would i, careful as i am not to know what anybody anywhere      is doing at any time?oh, jack, make a note find out where they got senator tucson's boy locked up - what's his name? - the boy? hell, i don't remember find out when's the trial, get a lawyer down there - who? evans? - not evans find somebody with less oil in his hair      and don't look like he sing with a band put one of your pals on it you have any idea who it was got cut?i don't care if it was the sainted aunt of the apostle paul well, i just happen to know fella's son of a doctor, paper said they're pretty important around here, you know, a doctor in the country they think they're somebody and maybe it gets out you're trying to fix it to get the boy off wouldn't do you any good - now, it appears to me, maybe-- - you don't know a goddamn thing had you been listening      i told jack to prime the lawyer through a pal find somebody who don't need to see his name in lights that way, nobody knows who picked him wasn't me might as well been the pope himself far as anybody knows all right i get you yeah, just barely - hey, there, pop  - how you doing, son?- how you making out? - oh, i'm getting along good to see you  you looking good - i brought the infantry here  - how are you?- more prettier than ever  - hey, grandpa how you doing, buddy? how's the arm?- he gonna be all-american  - i know he is  i know he is all right, governor, sir, here we go  one, two     bastard give me a slug pa don't favor drinking used to be lucy didn't favor it i don't know what she do or don't favor no more not that it matters yeah, i must have poured 10,000 gallons of swill in them troughs still doing it  pouring swill some things never change hey - what's up? - judge irwin judge irwin what?- spill it  - i'll spill it when i have my breath you're using it up explaining you don't have it you think it's funny? you won't when i tell you - you tell me later  - byram rang up he said the afternoon papers have got the judge saying      the allegations warrant a full-on investigation two-timing bastard that two-timing bastard clear them out tiny was figuring on having supper up here clear them all out which way up there?jack, tell sugar how to get to the house it's your people live down here suppose he don't open up?make him  what i pay you for?- yeah, who is it? - it's jack jack?well, i'll be hey, come on in you're not in any trouble, are you?no, jack's not in any trouble matter of fact, he doing all right, all things considered i trust you don't mind if jack pours me a slug i didn't know his duties ran to those of manservant      but if i'm mistaken, i'm sorry  - oh, hell sometimes jack pours me a drink, sometimes i pour him one sometimes i pour myself one i could pour you one no, thank you this today's?yeah, i don't get much time to read the papers      rushing around the state doing the good work well, perhaps, i can relieve your curiosity on one point somewhere in there's my opinion on the severity      of the allegations against you, if that's of interest somebody told me that but you know how rumor hath a thousand tongues and how them newspaper boys, they can exaggerate some it's no exaggeration yeah, i see if you're clear on that and finished with your drink      i'd appreciate it if you'd just get out hey, thank you, judge, i think i will have just one more spot so i see it there in the paper, and i hear you say it      but are you sure you took it to the lord in prayer?i settled it in my mind see, that's unsettling because if i recollect right, i recollect that      when we had our conversation in town that time      you sort of felt like what macmurphy and his boys were saying about me      was beneath contempt i made no commitment to you or to them, only to my conscience - i beg your pardon, your what? - i beg yours you been toiling around politics too long to use a word like conscience      so easily no, my change of conscience came when certain features of your      public services, shall we say, came to my attention somebody dug something up for you? in the dirt?yeah, not just one thing and not very deep well, dirt's a funny thing ain't nothing but dirt on god's green earth except what's under the water and that's dirt too, come to think of it dirt makes the grass green      let it breathe the diamond on my wife's finger ain't nothing but dirt got awful hot what are we, but dirt blowed off the hands of god almighty?you and me and george washington and jack there still doesn't alter the fact i'm not trying to alter anything, just illuminate it yeah you saying macmurphy and his bunch, yelling for my impeachment      they're responsible, law-abiding men?yeah, they're responsible all right, to alta power and oil companies      and the rest of them thieves i wouldn't know about that only way to not know is to not wanna know i'm retired, mr  stark  a reporter asked my opinion and i gave it if you was retired, no reporter would wanna ask you anything what you say matters a lot more than you pretend it don't so i'm asking you      call off the dogs asking is different than telling and that sounded like telling to me didn't it to you, jack?you been a judge a long time yes, i have how would it feel, do you think      to not be one no more?no man has ever been able to intimidate me i said what i said and i see no reason to say or think anything different despite your expositions on laws and men, sir suit yourself you're right, jack  he don't scare easy judge, it's more in pain than wrath i go let's go  it's past sugar boy's bedtime your employer is calling you, jack i wouldn't go around advertising this visit to anyone in case you change your mind bastard well, jackie, you got a job cut out for you - macmurphy  - no, the judge you bring down the lion      the rest of the jungle will quake in fear and they'll all fall into line - i won't find anything  - oh, yes, you will a man is conceived in sin and born in corruption      and passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud you'll find something and make it stick <i>apart from pleasing the boss, i could see little advantage   </i><i>    in finding anything beyond what was already known about judge irwin </i><i>what was known was that he was kind to you   </i><i>    when your father left you and your mother without saying why </i><i>what was known was that he taught you   </i><i>     the things your father should have:</i><i>how to be a gentleman </i><i>how to firmly shake a hand </i><i>how to safely load a shotgun and lead a duck if you wanted to hit it </i><i>what was known   </i><i>    was that he was more of a father to you than your real father   </i><i>    who you didn't know at all </i>hold it, please governor's penthouse how you doing digging something up on judge irwin?nothing nothing  found nothing or done nothing?there was nothing to find  i could dig to china, wouldn't find anything - and i'm not framing him  - framing?ain't nobody talking about framing that's never necessary the truth is always sufficient  you just find the truth it's a waste of time and money jesus, doesn't anybody listen to what i say anymore?you don't wanna do it, don't do it  or are you just looking for a raise?i'm gonna give you $ 100 raise whether you want it or not if i wanted more money, i'd make it you gonna tell me you work for me for love?i don't know why i work for you, but it ain't for love or money well, that's right, it's not and you don't know why but i do why?boy, you work for me because i'm the way i am      and you the way you are      and that's just an arrangement founded in the natural order of things she sure could skate right now      hidden away in chambers      not out here in the open like you and me      there's a legislature full of hyena-headed      belly-dragging sons of bitches      setting around trying to figure out how to impeach me now, they say it's because i got crooks on the payroll i say, \"is that all?\"of course i got them  i got a can of oil in the garage too      because there ain't a machine made by man      don't need a squirt of that from time to time just to keep running!but my crooks      unlike theirs      are all atremble      to be too crooked they're itty-bitty compared to their crooks in there the standard oil and the power companies besides, i got my eye on mine ain't nobody watching over these crooks ain't nobody got their eye on them      while they rob the resources of this state!who made that son of a bitch what he is? who made him governor?and he goes and two-times me? i'll kill him no, he's two-timing lucy you need some other kind of arithmetic for what he's doing to you lucy, she's a fool  she's     - i don't know what  - his wife a hick with a college degree from some baptist hole in the ground what was she like?- i didn't know lucy any further back-- - the slut on skates i don't know, i was looking at her skates sure you were - was she pretty? - look, just forget it how young was she?- who cares? - look at me he'll be back  the world is full of sluts on skates skates, grass skirts, geisha outfits contortionists <i>every man a king every man a king</i><i>for you can be a millionaire</i><i>but there's

beautiful time we all had here once?you sure that's what it was?- yes  - then why did it turn into this time?with me drinking myself to death      adam getting more reclusive and strange      and you

everything is the seaboard bank in savannah?not since 1938 what happened in '38?bought out by georgia fidelity got any idea who was president then?franklin roosevelt ma'am, of the bank lemoyne carruthers was my friend a dear friend and his daughter, mabel, well, i did what i could for her      even after her financial reversal the year of her financial reversal was roughly what?she threw that inheritance away two or three notes i paid myself for the memory of lemoyne, my dear friend but she'd come back at me without shame and say, \"i want money \"for parties and balls and to adorn herself for she was plain, to be kind then she was broke when she met the judge so was he  this is when he was still attorney general      under governor stanton pulling down 3400 a year      while paying off liens on his place on the row to the tune of 42,000 well, you see there, you are a detective you dug and chinked the metal box      and are enjoying the sound of it a bit, if i'm not mistaken might still be empty no, it's full crawling with maggots by now, maybe      but still a little something they was chewing on  just have to look still have to find the key  and that ain't gonna be easy well, there's nothing easy that means anything you'll do it  i have faith i like this one, slade now, they all is yelling that i got no right to what's on their table what's on their table is theirs i'm not trying to take it \"go ahead, sit down at that table,\" i tell \"have all you want to eat  eat till you can't eat no more now, what's left on that table      when you can't eat no more, even if you tried      leave that there because that's for the rest of us \"and for that, they're trying to ruin me for taking what they left on the table      and using it to build something for you!to build 3000 miles of paved highways      a hundred and eleven new bridges, 208 new schools      60,000 brand-new jobs!now, they wanna ruin me      because they wanna ruin you but your will is my strength your need is my justice and i won't let them!it come to me in a dream whilst you were up in savannah with your pail and shovel, eating oysters what did?i'm gonna build me the best-staffed, best-equipped      biggest goddamn health center this state ever saw this country ever saw  the all-father hisself you want me to do what to further this noble enterprise?deliver me my chief of staff fine  you give me a list of who you're thinking to run it only one name on it:dr  adam stanton that's my boy, tom! that's the way! you see that?that's an all-american pass  goddamn it  attaboy, tom!well, somebody gotta run this hospital he's gotta be the best, don't he?- adam stanton is not the best  - well, he is for what i need they'll never approve the money otherwise willie, adam's an old friend of mine as i certainly know, else i wouldn't be asking i know him and i know you  he won't do it what's wrong with me?to him, what isn't?you're everything his father fought against he hates what you represent, if not you yourself i'm not asking him to love me - i'm asking him to run a hospital  - your hospital the people's hospital, where any poor redneck and nigger can get the best      without paying a dime  he ought to like that no  what you're asking is for him to put his family's name next to yours so you can trot him out in front of senators and say:\"lookie here, lookie who i got standing next to me the son of the most honorable man who ever served this state \"just get him not easy being the son of a great man it don't look so hard for my boy tom out there far as you know we should go not yet  let's go in again <i>the friend of your youth   </i><i>    is the only friend you'll ever have </i><i>for he doesn't really see you </i><i>he sees in his mind a face, which doesn't exist anymore </i><i>and speaks a name- -</i><i>spike, bud, red, rusty, jack </i><i>- that belongs to that now nonexistent face </i><i>he's still the young idealist you used to be </i><i>still sees good and bad in black and white   </i><i>    and men as sinners or saints, but never both </i><i>- hey, adam  - feels superior in the knowledge    </i><i>    that you no longer can distinguish the two </i><i>- jack  - that's what drives you to it   </i><i>-     try to stick the knife in  - come on in </i><i>for there's a kind of snobbery in failure </i><i>like the twist to the mouth of a drunk </i>you're looking good, jack thank you  i'll take that as a compliment been playing much?who wants to know, my sister?it was just a question - everything good? - yes, jack, everything's good all right  i'm gonna tell you something i don't want you to start yelling at me until i'm finished governor stark wants you as director      of the medical center he's building  whatever you want      all you have to do is say, it's yours - money? - i didn't say that what do i want money for? i got everything i want  look around i didn't say money then what? what's next when that doesn't work?- a threat of some kind? - of course not that's how he gets things done? what he relies on?the bribe and the threat?i would never do that to you or let anyone else  you know that i don't know what you think he's thinking, jack      or what you're thinking, but couldn't be flattery he's thinking what he thinks about anybody he wants something from      who doesn't wanna give it  - something from their past - you just said he wasn't  - not their past, their weakness - same thing  - no, it isn't i'm not gonna debate it with you, jack  we're not in school anymore i don't care if you know i'm right  i don't care if i am right  but i am then what is it, jack? what is my weakness?you can't look at anybody with something broke      without wanting to fix it - and that's a weakness? - some would say you would say - it's no disgrace  - well, then tell me, jack tell me, please  how is that a weakness?- i don't need to tell you  - i think you do if you don't know, i'll leave you to think about it  it'll come to you no, it won't, jack  and you'll have to go to your boss      and tell him you failed without taking out the big guns so tell me, for your sake, how is that a weakness?because it makes you do things you don't wanna do if they're good and this is  he may not be      but this is it was good to see you, adam now, before i tell y'all the story about how this great university      changed the life of a boy from mason city      who, by all rights, should still be swilling hogs      first, i'm gonna set your minds at ease on another point of interest i brung my checkbook with me - you own one share? - i do  i just bought it now, that gives me the right as a stockholder      to view the company's equity records, doesn't it?governor, sir?miss littlepaugh?you're from the insurance company no, no, i'm not but i know about your brother's insurance policy not that there was much left on it to collect he borrowed against it almost down to nothing  didn't he?which means you lied      for almost nothing now, don't you go jumping out a window it wasn't the money      it was the disgrace i wanted him buried in the good part of the cemetery      not in the back, with all the sinners why did he kill himself?they drove him to it  to make room for that thief, irwin my brother went to the justice department      and told them he knew all about their man irwin      and the bribes      but they wouldn't listen - are you lying to me? - no, that's what killed him he wrote the letter to me and told me and then that night he     all right, wait  what letter?the letter he wrote me explaining it all the lawsuit irwin was paid to let up on      and how the power company hid the payoffs      by firing my brother and giving irwin his job where's the letter now? what happened to it?oh, i have it kept it all this time?you have the letter here?<i>you bring down the lion   </i><i>    the rest of the jungle will quake in fear   </i><i>    and they'll all fall into line </i>your employer is calling you, jack thank you hello hello, anne - what's that? - orange soda two straws - i think i might want something else  - i didn't say one of them was for you it's the way it's drunk  tradition - i know you went to see adam  - i did  what of it?what did you say to him?i went there and i offered him a job  no use blaming me - i'm not blaming you  - well, that's what it sounds like that's what you sound like  if you could hear yourself i want him to take it  i want you to go back      and ask him again jack, you know how it is  my brother is the son of a governor      the grandson of a senator, the great-grandson of a general <i>she wasn't telling me anything i didn't already know about adam </i><i>but she was doing it walking next to me   </i><i>    which is all that mattered </i><i>so i let her go on as long as she wanted </i><i>i knew that adam had already made his decision </i><i>he had decided to take the job when i first brought it up </i><i>he was just putting some time between my visit and now   </i><i>    out of pride </i>he needs to do this to be part of something himself      before he disappears <i>but something about what she was saying bothered me </i><i>the way an off-stage noise bothers you </i>what kind of life is that?<i>something you hear- -</i>he's a guardian of dead men <i>- but not clear enough to catch the meaning of </i>i want him to take it  he has to do it <i>so you push it aside </i>i guess that's one of your gunmen i've heard about sugar boy, hell, no he just carry that peashooter for decoration i tell you one thing, though  ain't nobody can drive like him so, what do you think, doc?i think it'll do the people of the state some good      and get you some votes there's a lot of ways to get votes  cheaper ones so i understand because there are some things i understand and some things you don't  just like there's some i don't what i do know is what makes the mare go and that you can always make goodness out of badness - that would be two things  - them's the two things i know, then and both of them wrong no, neither one of them, sir  i beg your pardon you can always make good from bad, in all things in politics, poetry      everything in between  makes no difference a man writes a sonnet      and it's good is it less good if it turns out      the dame he wrote it about is married to someone else?that his passion was illicit?come on, i wanna show you something i wouldn't mind understanding something, actually lf, as you say, there's only bad to start with from conception on      and that good must be made from bad      then how do you ever know what the good is?well, that's simple  you just make it up as you go along make up what?the good  what else are we talking about?make it up as you go along?yeah  just like folks have been doing for a million years since we fall out of trees, crawl out the swamp they just cook up what is right if nobody likes that, well, just cook it up again      a little different with a lid on and you know what?things under a lid don't look no different than things      not under a lid when there's one on it you don't have to convince me of anything, mr  stark you've already done that  i'm here, aren't i?that's right  and you're a good boy too, doc a lot better than you think so goddamn it don't let none of them bastards tell you no different i got a question since everybody's trying to understand everything      all of a sudden back when we met      at slade's old place, when we shook hands--do you remember that moment?like it was yesterday did you or did you not give me a wink?a wink?well, that's just gonna have to remain a mystery - you don't remember  - sure i do then   ?you know, i     i just do recall giving you a wink but then, maybe i got something in my eye      which would make it more of a blink did you have something in your eye?what if i didn't?what would that mean?that maybe you figured you and me      had something in common the others didn't well, i'm not gonna tell you and deprive you of the mystery there's just too few honest-to-god mysteries left to go around and long after i'm dead and gone      and long after these sons of bitches are dead and gone      i'm talking eternally now      the willie stark hospital will still be standing where every man, woman and child      who's sick or in pain can go in      knowing they'll get all a man can do not as charity, but as a right, as your right!as it is that every child shall have a complete education!that no person, aged or infirm, shall want or beg for bread!that no poor man's land or house will be taxed!that you shall not be deprived of hope!and if any man      stands between me      and fulfilling your rights      i will strike him down      so help me god!hip, shin, thigh and neck bone, i will hit him i will hit him with a meat ax somebody give me a meat ax      and bring me another one for my friend and ally!because it's not only god's only son with us on this one it's the son of the last great leader of this state:governor joe stanton's boy, dr  adam stanton!all right  see there?it's not so bad  it's not gonna kill you what's up?sadie now he's done it he's done it again, and i swear this time     - done? - don't act so dumb or any dumber than you are  he's two-timing me again or four or one or whatever timing you wanna call it      because you're such a smartass - she skate? - shut up you and your friends  your highbrow friends all the money and privilege and everything else      you pretend means nothing  to someone with it, it means nothing don't look so dumb  i said it annoys me i have no idea what you're talking about      or what it was tangled you two up in the first place, love or hate you know what i'm talking about maybe you fixed it up  i'm sure you did surely he's fixed you up, like that pathetic      crazy brother of hers, to say thanks \"thanks, jack  she is a looker, i do declare i'm naming you sdp, yes, sir state director of pimps \"what are you saying?are you saying   ?thank you are you s--?<i>i love you </i>we're gonna walk some more all right hello

about to be taken from us   </i><i>    leaving in its place something we didn't know </i><i>which didn't make her sad   </i><i>    but it did me </i><i>you only get a couple of moments that determine

burden i'll wait in his study until he comes down fire this marble watch the chandelier okay, you can fire hello, jack  i didn't know you were at your mother's - you just get in? - last night yeah  it's a bit early in the day, but what do you think?a touch of bourbon never hurt anyone least not you and me we're indestructible, aren't we, you and me?- no, thanks  - \"no, thanks,\" he says begging the question, as the old man pours just one drink      what's on your mind?out with it you know who i work for how could i forget?but let's just sit and pretend that i have come sit over here with me the truth is i don't hold the same low opinion of him      as many of our friends on the row i was almost for him at one time he was busting out windowpanes and, yeah, letting in some fresh air but now i am worried about him knocking down the whole house so you threw in with his enemies after you said you wouldn't oh, jack what is politics but a matter of choices?you make a choice knowing there's a chance it's the wrong one you've made a choice and you know how much it's cost you there's always a price for everything we do when we came by that night and were leaving      you said you would think about it about calling off the dogs? no, i did not say that your memory is faulty, sir  he said, \"think about it\"      which i don't have to i don't have to think about things i already know you should think it over  even now      because it's not too late too late for what?hey, jack jesus - what is it? - just say you'll back stark      against these attacks  - no!now, that has the sound of finality, don't it?- yes, it does  - yeah you know, i find this difficult to believe for me too and that your boss would even think he could pressure me could blackmail me - the first word is better  - the first word is prettier, not better don't you know that this stuff wouldn't stand up? not in any court it happened almost 25 years ago you couldn't get any testimony      except from that woman who is related      and whose testimony, if she gave it      would be worthless and everybody else, jack      everybody else is dead you're not you're not dead  and you don't live in any court you live in the world, where people think you're a certain kind of man i am a certain kind of man you know, when i was a kid it seemed natural      that a grown man would stay up nights with catgut      and steel wire, pliers and scissors, and make little catapults read books about them will you change your mind?you know, i could hurt you, jack like you're trying to hurt me i could say something i could tell you something      that would hurt but i won't think it over  i'll be by tomorrow my mind's made up now i'll come back tomorrow made up now mother  mother - mother  mama  - you! you! you

friend of the family      growing up, all that, so i'm sorry the old bastard shot himself      but we still got macmurphy and his boys to deal with and that didn't work out the way we hoped you need

him      about me about you?about you and the governor  you can say it, anne it doesn't hurt any more to hear it than to know it he told him what i'd done      and he said that i'd do anything to help the governor      get what he wanted  even if that meant      sacrificing my brother to some kind of fraud which is all the hospital was nothing but a scheme to rob the state and that when the truth came out      and it would, adam would take the blame he'd go to prison  for every scheme needs a fall guy and he's it - whoever said that is lying  - i know i tried to tell him that's not the way it was  that he was wrong but he wouldn't listen he grabbed me and said that he would not be made a fool that everything else could be filthy and corrupt      but that a man didn't have to be and then he said that      he wouldn't be a paid pimp to his sister's whore he said that to me well, neither will i why did you do it?- you knew what it would do to me  - it had nothing to do with you - then what? - i don't know!- well, you better think of something! - i wasn't thinking--!yes, you were! yes, you were was it because of me or in spite of me?i'd never hurt you like that you would and you

using our ibm machines to figure the odds the day before the kentucky derby i called in the vice squad, who raided him - the vice squad? - that's right what's that got to do with me? i'm not running any bookie joint - just what kind of joint are you running? - sir?a key is floating around from kirkeby to vanderhof to eichelberger to dobisch it's the key to a certain apartment - know who that apartment belongs to? - who?loyal, resourceful, cooperative c c  baxter - oh  - are you going to deny it?no  i'm not going to deny it  if you'd just let me explain you'd better well      about a year ago, i was going to night school, studying advanced accounting one of the guys in our department    lives in jersey    had to go to a banquet in town he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo, so i gave him the key word must've gotten out because all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another  it all got out of hand baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming   how many charter members are there in this little club?just those four  out of a total of 31,259 so actually we can be very proud of our personnel    percentagewise that's not the point  four rotten apples in a barrel, however large the barrel   - do you realize if this ever leaked out    - it won't!believe me  never again  nobody is gonna use my apartment from now on - where is your apartment? - west 67th street you have no idea what i go through with the neighbors, the landlady and the

picnic's over  goodbye the kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife      and the girl   they don't make these shrimp like they used to i never said goodbye, fran for a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man then one day he keeps looking at his watch      and asks you if any lipstick's showing      then rushes out to catch the 7:14 to white plains so you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee      and you sit there by yourself and you think      and it all begins to look so    ugly how do you think i felt riding home on that 7:14 train?why do you keep calling me, jeff? what do you want from me?i want you back, fran sorry, mr  sheldrake  i'm full up  you'll have to take the next elevator you're not giving me a chance, fran  i have

help it  you can't suddenly walk out on one man      because you have a date with another man - you did the decent thing  - don't be too sure just because i wear a uniform, that doesn't make me a girl

drink while driving you're so right  by the power vested in me, i declare this elevator out of order shall we join the natives?- why not? they seem friendly enough  - don't you believe it there'll be

water - i'll be right back! - i'll be right here hi!how's the branch manager from kansas city?- i beg your pardon? - i'm miss olsen mr  sheldrake's secretary so you don't have to play innocent with me

vigil will not be of long duration  please continue let us commend our brother george to the mercy of god,our maker and redeemer long live the king i hope i will make good as he has made good - what on earth was that? - poor wallis now, i'm trapped and in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years,if there is one thing that king george has taught,it is the art of the leader who is also e brother to his followers as long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation - dad? - mmm-hmm?- when he died    - time for a shake, dad?   the little children cried in the streets - you sure? - go on put your thinking caps on - i bet it's the scottish play  - no, it's othello  it's always othello art thou afeard?- be not afeard  - caliban oh, for heaven's sake  that was a lucky guess

voices, that, if then i had waked after long sleep,will make me sleep again  all right, clever clogs, so what comes next?and then, in dreaming, methought the clouds would   - the clouds methought  - the clouds methought would open,and show riches ready to drop upon me,that when i waked, i cried to dream again that's such a sad thought my next patient must be a bit early  you better go, lads, i'm sorry won't be a moment, clifford bertie?they told me not to expect you i'm sorry about your father - i don't wish to intrude  - not at all  please, come in  come in i've been practicing  an hour a

father i was informed, after the fact,that my father's   my father's last words were      \"bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together \"couldn't say that to my face my brother what about him?try singing it - i'm sorry? - what songs do you know?- songs? - yeah, songs - swanee riven - i love that song - it happens to be my favorite  - sing me the chorus no  certainly not you

throne?to tell the truth, it was a relief knowing i      wouldn't be    king but unless he produces an heir, you're next in line and your daughter, elizabeth, would then succeed you \u00e2\u0099\u00aa you're barking up the wrong tree now, doctor, doctor \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa lionel \u00e2\u0099\u00aasee? you didn't stammer of course i didn't stammer, i was singing well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts - your boy    won't mind? - no, not at all david and i were    very close young bucks, you know did you chase the same girls?david was always very helpful in    arranging introductions we shared the      expert ministrationsof paulette in the palace not at the same time, of course - did david ever tease you? - oh, yes, they all did \"b-b-b-bertie \"father encouraged it said, \"get it out, boy!\" said it would make me stop he said, \"l was afraid of my fatherand my children are    damn well gonna be afraid of me!\"are you naturally right-handed?left i was    punished, and now i use the right yes, that's very common with stammerers - any other corrections? - knock knees metal splints were made worn    worn day and night - must have been painful  - bloody agony straight legs now who were you closest to in your family?nannies not my first nanny  she   she loved david  hated me when we were      presented to my parents for the daily viewing,she would    she'd pinch meso that i'd cry and be handed back to her immediately and then she would   sing it \u00e2\u0099\u00aa then she wouldn't feed mefar, far away \u00e2\u0099\u00aatook my parents    three years to notice as you    as you can imagine, caused some stomach problems still what about your brother, johnnie?were you close to him?johnnie    sweet boy

lifeand how little he knows of mine - thank you  - what are friends for?i wouldn't know i sifted seven      thick-stalked thistles through a strong, thick sieve - i sifted seven thick-stalked    - that's enough now, darling listen, i have to keep doing this, it's awful  i sifted seven   - oh, no  -    thick-stalked   one-hundred-year-old spruces removed to improve the view?who does she think

thick sieves    i sifted seven   three, two, one and   their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of york oh, how lovely to see you both welcome to our little country shack i came at the invitation of the king your majesty - you all right? - sorry we're late very nice to see you    mrs  simpson very nice hello, david  making some      changes to the garden, i see yes, i'm not quite finished yet don't tell me i behaved badly, mr  churchill on the contrary, your royal highness etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host,in this case, the king  not a commoner thank you - what is her hold on him? - i've no idea apparently, she has certain skillsacquired in an establishment in shanghai david just be a sec, darling  would you excuse me?- david, i've been trying to see you  - i've been terribly busy - doing what? - kinging really? kinging is a      a precarious business these days  where's the russian tsar?- where's cousin wilhelm? - you're being dreary ls kinging laying off 80    staff and buying more pearls for wallis,while people are marching across europe singing the red flag?- herr hitler will sort them out  - who will sort out herr hitler?where's the bloody 23?and you put that woman in our mother's suite!- mama's not still in the bed, is she? - that's not funny here it is  wallis likes the very best i don't care what woman you carry on with at night,as long as you    show up for duty in the morning wallis is not just some woman i'm carrying on with we intend to marry - excuse me? - she's filing a petition for divorce good god can't you just give her a nice house and a title?- i'm not having her as my mistress  - the church doesn't recognize divorce,- and you are the    head of the church  - haven't i any rights?- many privileges  - not the same thing your beloved common man may marry for love  why not me?if you were    a common man,on what basis could you    possibly claim to be king?sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution - sounds like you haven't  - that's what this is about brushing up  hence, the elocution lessons - that's the scoop around town  - i'm trying to   yearning for a larger audience, are we, b-b-bertie?don't    what's that?i'm sorry, i   younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne p-p-positively mediaeval wallis ah  where have you been all this time?- who have you been talking to? - never you mind what a very complicated little king you are i try to be all that work    down the drain my own brother i couldn't say a single word to him in reply why do you stammer so much more with david than you ever do with me?because you're bloody well paid to listen - bertie, i'm not a geisha girl  - stop trying to be so bloody clever what is it about david that stops you speaking?what is it about you that bloody well makes you want to go on about him-the whole bloody time? - vulgar but fluent - you don't stammer when you swear  - bugger off!- ls that the best you can do? - well, bloody      bugger to you, you beastly bastard oh, a public school prig could do better than that shit shit, shit, shit shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue - because i'm angry! - do you know the \"f\" word?- fornication? - oh, bertie fuck  fuck!fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck! fuck, fuck and bugger!bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!- fuck, ass! - yes!- balls, balls, fuckety shit  - you see? not a hesitation willy, shit and fuck! and tits - dad, what's going on? - sorry just finish your homework well, that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often no no, we're not supposed to, really  not publicly - let's get some air  - no, i don't think that's a good idea what's the matter? why are you so upset?logue, you have no idea my    my brotheris infatuated with a      woman who's been married twice she's asking for a divorce, and he's determined to marry her - jesus  - mrs  wallis simpson- of baltimore  - that's not right - queen wallis of baltimore  - unthinkable - can he do it? - absolutely not but he's going to anyway  all hell's broken loose - can't they just carry on privately? - if only they would where does this leave you?i know my place  i   i    i will do anything      in my power to keep my brother on the throne is it that serious?- your place may well be on the throne  - i am not an alternative to my brother - you can outshine david  - don't take liberties!- that's bordering on treason  - i'm just saying you could be king - you could do it  - that is treason i'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear i've had enough of this - what are you so afraid of? - your poisonous words!why did you come to me? you're not some middle-class bankerwho wants elocution lessons so you can chitchat   don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!i am the son of a    king and the brother of    of a king you're the disappointing son of a brewer a jumped-up jackeroo from the outback you're a nobody  these sessions are over through here, sir it's not because she's an american  that is the least of it it's because she's a soon to be twice divorced american and the king, as head of the church of england,cannot marry a divorced woman and, sir, i apologize for the nature of this according to scotland yard,the king has not always possessed exclusive rightsto mrs  simpson's    favors and affections      sharing them with a married used car salesman,a certain mr  guy trundle in addition, it is also rumored hitler's ambassador,count von ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day should his majesty continue to ignore the advice of his government,he must abdicate otherwise, his government has no choice but to resign prime minister, you'd leave a country without a      a government?does the king do what he wants?or does he do what the people expect him to do?as crowds in downing street watch ministers come and go,can a king separate his personal life- from his public duty    - what's the matter, love?i'm just having trouble with a patient that isn't like you - why? - he's scared he's afraid of his own shadow isn't that why they come to you?this fellow could really be somebody great he's fighting me perhaps he doesn't want to be great perhaps that's what you want i might have overstepped the mark apologize  do you both good i'm very sorry, mr  logue, the duke is busy i'm happy to wait  or i could come back later as i said, the duke is terribly busy thank you thank you parliament will not support the marriage but there are other reasons for concern he was careless with state papers  he lacked commitment and resolve,and there are those who are worried about where he will standwhen war comes with germany - we're not coming to that? - indeed we are, sir prime minister baldwin may deny this, but hitler's intent is crystal clear war with germany will come and we will need a king whom we can all stand behind, united i fear my      brother is not of sound mind      at this time have you thought what you will call yourself? hmm?certainly not albert, sir  too germanic what about george? after your father?george the sixth has a rather nice continuity to it don't you think?david  thank god you look exhausted how are you bearing up?bertie, the decision's been made  i   i'm going - i can't accept that    - i'm afraid there's no other way i must marry her my mind's made up  i'm    sorry that's a terrible thing to hear nobody wants that i, least of all at long last,i am able to say a few words of my own i have never wanted to withhold anything,but until now it has not been constitutionally possiblefor me to speak a few hours ago, i discharged my last dutyas king and emperor,and now that i have been succeeded by my brothel;the duke of york,my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him this i do with all my heart you all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne,but you must believe me when i tell youthat i have found it impossible to carry the heavy burdenof responsibility and to discharge my duties as king,as i would wish to dowithout the help and support of the woman i love and i want you to know,this decision has been made less difficult to meby the sure knowledge that my brother,with his long training in the public affairs of this country,and with his fine qualities,will be able to take my place forthwithwithout interruption or injuryto the life and progress of the empire i meet you today      in      in circumstances which are   - i'm sure you'll love it  - there you go thank you, darling  saddles  margaret - there's montezuma  - oh, here's one - mama, here's a horse and saddle  - thank you  oops - don't worry, sally  we'll get you    - mama?- yes? - will we have space for our horses- in our new home? - course we will, darling we'll have a palace of rooms curtsey your majesty how was it?i was trying to    familiarize myselfwith    what a state paper looks like it's a      dispatch from mr  baldwin, which i don't understand a word of david's finances christmas    broadcast - think that would be a mistake  - no, don't worry about that oh plans for the coronation think that would be an even bigger mistake - i'm not a king  - oh, shush i'm a naval officer  that's all i know i'm not a king  i'm not a king - i'm sorry  - no - i'm sorry  - no, don't be silly  please oh, my dear my dear, dear man - i'm sorry  - you know,i refused your first two marriage proposals,not because i didn't love you,but because i couldn't bear the idea of a royal life couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours, public duty, of   well, a life that no longer was really to be my own but then i thought, he stammers so beautifully, they'll leave us alone waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait i'm afraid we're slightly late this is home myrtle's at bridge  i made sure the boys were out it's lovely  absolutely lovely - oh! may i sit down? - yes, of course - would you like some tea, ma'am? - yes, i'll help myself now, off you go  or must i knock your heads together?here's your shilling i understand      what you were trying to say, logue i went about it the wrong way i'm sorry so, here i am is the nation ready for two    minutes of radio silence?every stammerer always fears going back to square one i don't let that happen if i fail in my duty,david could come back  i've seen the placards \"god save our    king \"they don't mean me every monarch in historyhas succeeded someone who's deador just about to be my predecessor is not only alive, but very much so it's a bloody mess couldn't even give them a christmas speech - like your dad used to do? - precisely he's not here anymore yes, he is  he's on that shilling i gave you easy enough to give away you don't have to carry him around in your pocket or your brother you don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid ofwhen you were five you're very much your own man, bertie am i?- your face is next, mate  - lionel, dear!myrtle - is this your wife? - yes bertie  come here - are you all right, logue? - yes - shouldn't we go through? - trust me, it's important - what is it? - oh!- you're    - it's \"your majesty\" the first time after that, it's \"ma'am \" as in \"ham \"not \"malm\" as in \"palm \"i haven't told her about us sit down, relax i'm told your husband calls my husband bertie and my husband calls your husband lionel i trust you won't call me liz your majesty, you may call me mrs  logue, ma'am very nice to meet you, mrs  logue - logue, we can't stay here all day  - yes, we can - logue! - i need to wait for the right moment - logue, you're being a coward  - you're damn right get out there, man hello, myrtle, darling you're early i believe you two have met, but i don't think you know   -    king george the sixth  - it's very nice to meet you will their majesties be staying to dinner?we'd love to, such a treat, but alas a      previous engagement  what a pity - archbishop  - welcome, your majesty what a glorious transformation, sir i hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations?now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony we begin, of course, at the west door into the nave i see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, archbishop ah, yes  wireless it is, indeed, a pandora's box,and i'm afraid i've also had to permit the newsreel cameras the product of which i shall personally edit without momentary hesitations this is dr  logue of harley street he's    my speech therapist - your grace  - had i known that your majestywas seeking assistance, i should have made my own recommendation dr  logue will      will be attending the coronation of course i'll speak to the dean, but it will be extremely difficult i should like the      doctor to be seated in the      king's box but members of your family will be seated there, sir that is why it is suitable and now, if you don't mind, your grace, we need the premises my dear fellow, this is westminster abbey the church must prepare his majesty my preparations are equally as important with complete privacy, if you don't mind those are my wishes, your grace i will place the abbey at your majesty's disposal,this evening  your majesty i can't believe i'm walking on chaucer and handel and dickens everything all right? let's get cracking i'm not here to rehearse, dr  logue call me lionel true, you    never      called yourself doctor  i did that      for you no training no diploma, no      qualificationsjust    a great deal of nerve the star chamber inquisition, is it?you asked for trust and    total equality bertie, i heard you at wembley  i was there my son laurie said, \"dad, do you think you could help that poor man?\"- what, as a failed actor? - it's true i'm not a doctor  and yes, i acted, a bit well, i recited in pubs  i taught elocution in schools when the great war came,all our soldiers were returning to australia from the front,a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak somebody said, lionel, \"you're very good at this speech stuff do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?\"i did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation,but i knew i had to go deeper those poor young blokes had cried out in fear no one was listening to them my job was to give them faith in their own voice,and let them know that a friend was listening that must ring a few bells with you, bertie you give a very noble account of yourself - make inquiries  it's all true  - inquiries have been made you have no idea who i have breathing down my neck i vouched for you, and you have no   -    credentials  - but lots of success i can't show you a certificate  there was no training then everything i know, i know from experience and that war was some experience my plaque says, \"l  logue, speech defects \"not \"doctor \" there are no letters after my name - lock me in the tower  - i would if i could - on what charge? - fraud with war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless      king  you've destroyed the happiness of my family,all for the sake of ensnaring a star    patient you couldn't      possibly hope to assist it'll be like mad      king george the third i'll be    mad king      george the stammerer      who let his people down so badly in their hour of need what are you doing? get up! you can't sit there! get up!- why not? it's a chair  - no, it    that is not a chair!that is    that   - that is saint edward's chair  - people have carved their names on it that chair is the seat on which every king   - it's held in place by a large rock  - that is the stone of scone!- you are trivializing everything  - i don't care how many royal assholes- have sat on this chair  - listen to me! listen to me!- listen to you? by what right? - by divine right, if you must - i am your king! - no, you're not you told me so yourself  you said you didn't want it why should i waste my time listening to you?because i have a right to be heard! i have a voice!yes, you do you have such perseverance, bertie  you're the bravest man i know you'll make a bloody good king - what on earth is going on, sir? - it's quite all right, archbishop mr  logue, you must know thati've found a replacement english specialist with impeccable credentials hence, your services will no longer be required - i'm sorry? - your majesty's functionis to consult and be advised  now, you didn't consult,- but you have just been advised  - and now i advise you in this personal matter, i will make my own decision my concern is for the head on which i must place the crown i appreciate that, archbishop but it's my head your humble servant thank you, bertie shall we rehearse? come on  up on your perch now, when you and elizabeth enter through the west door,you will be greeted by the hymn \"i was glad when they said unto me \"actually, you won't be that glad because they do sing it for a very long time then your friend, the archbishop, will ponce up the stairs towards you,and say, \"sir, is your majesty willing to take the oath?\"- \"l am willing \" - well, of course you are i'm gonna see what this sounds like in the cheap seats,so even your old nanny can hear \"will you govern your peoples, great britain, ireland, canada,australia and new zealand,according to their lands and customs?\"- \"l solemnly promise to do so \" - louder - i can't hear you up the back  - \"i solemnly promise to do so \"very good  \"and will you, to your power,cause law and justice, in mercy to be executed in all your judgments?\"\"i will  i will!\"then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith  it goes on,rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, to which you finally say   \"the things which i have    here before promised,i will perform and keep  so help me god \"and that's all you say  four short responses kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're king easy you nearly crowned him backwards, archbishop someone had removed the thread marking the back of the crown, sir try not to lose the thread, archbishop archbishop, we're missing papa - god save the king  - very good very good, archbishop well, i hope your majesties are thrilled with the result - you can switch that machine off  - no, wait  keep going - nazism has held its great convention  - do take a seat, archbishop masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye,and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audienceof the fuhrer - papa? papa, what's he saying? - hmm?i don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well sir    i have asked to see you todayin order to tender my resignation as prime minister i'm so sorry to hear that, mr  baldwin neville chamberlain will take my place as prime minister it's a matter of principle  i was mistaken i have found it impossible to believethat there is any man in the worldso lacking in moral feeling as hitler,that the world may be hurled for a second timeinto the abyss of destructive war churchill was right all along this was always hitler's intention i'm only very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis i'm very much afraid, sir, that your greatest test is yet to come i am speaking to you      from the cabinet room at 10 downing street this morning, the british ambassador in berlinhanded the german government a final notestating that unless we heard from them by 11:00,that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from poland,a state of war would exist between us i have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received,and that, consequently, this country is at war with germany at last, sir, here is your speech you are on air at six i have timed it to just under nine minutes the wording is fully approved the prime minister will be joining you for the broadcast,which will go outlive across the nation, the empire- and to our armed forces  - get logue here immediately - there's the barrage balloons  - yes - they got them up there quickly  - yeah - shall we pull over and find a shelter? - no, no  go straight there we'll be all right - yes, sir? - lionel logue major hartley is expecting me  this is my son, laurie - thank you, laurie  - good luck, dad - the king's speech  - thank you, sir we have about 40 minutes to the broadcast thank you very much  thank you there may be dark days ahead   -    and    - try again there may be dark days ahead, and   turn the hesitations into pauses and say to yourself, \"god save the king \"i say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening long pauses are good  they add solemnity to great occasions then i'm the solemnest king who ever lived you know, if i'm a king, where's my power?can i    can i form a government?can i    can i    levy a tax?declare a    a war? no and yet i'm the seat of all authority  why? because      the nation believes that when i    i speak,i speak for them  but i can't speak let's take it all again from the top  \"in this grave hour \"in this grave hour    fuck, fuck, fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history    bugger, shit, shit \u00e2\u0099\u00aa i send to every household of my   you see, \"p\" is always difficult,

but it has been    in vain we have been forced into a conflict,for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle,which, if it were to prevail,would be fatal to any civilized orderin the world such a principle,stripped of all disguise,is surely the mere      primitive doctrine that might      is right for the sake of all that we ourselves hold deanit is unthinkablethat we should refuse to meet      the challenge it is to this high purposethat i now callmy people at home,and my peoples across the seas,who will make our cause their own i ask them to stand calmand firm and unitedin this time of trial the task will be hard there may be dark days ahead,and war can no longer be confinedto the battlefield but we can only do the rightas we see the right,and reverently commitour cause to

-nearly healed sir, this is commander shears of the united states navy -good  -how do you do, sir?we found him and an australian all that's left of the prisoners who built the camp u s  navy? out here?for a sailor, i am sort of landlocked -you lost your ship? -the houston i made it ashore, but l got separated from the other survivors and your group here?mostly aussies  some lime--some british  indians, burmese, siamese and what happened to them?they died      of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene other causes of death:famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites      saito then there were some who just got tired of living has clipton seen you?just about to, sir  come over here, commander, you can shave later all right you'll stay with the officers we'll scrape up some decent clothing don't bother about me i'm not anxious to get off the sick list besides, this is working kit  it's the fashion out here the officers in your party did manual labor?i think you could call it that i raised that very point with colonel what's-his-name saito -l think he understands now  -ls that so?yes  l must say he seems quite a reasonable type well, l must be pushing on there's an officer's meeting at 7 -give me a list of your requirements  -yes, sir anything we can do oh, thank you, sir -what is it? -never mind go on, say it i can think of a lot of things to call saito      but reasonable, that's a new one perhaps colonel nicholson defines the word differently any other points?-by your leave, sir? -yes, jennings?about the escape committee  i've spoken with commander shears--there won't be any escape committee i don't understand, sir  lieutenant jennings has a plan yes, yes, i'm sure jennings has a plan, but escape?where? into this jungle? that fellow, saito, is right no need for barbed wire here  one chance in 1 00 of survival i'm sure a man of commander shears' experience will back me up on that i'd say the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one -right  -but may l add another word?please the odds against survival in this camp are even worse you've seen the graveyard  they're your real odds to give up hope of escape      to stop thinking about it, is like accepting a death sentence why haven't you tried to escape, commander?i'm biding my time  waiting for the right moment, the right company i understand how you feel of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape but my men and i are involved in a curious legal point      of which you are unaware in singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters ordered, mind you therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law -interesting? -yes, sir, interesting point i'm sorry, sir, i didn't quite follow you you intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?without law, commander, there is no civilization that's just my point  here, there is no civilization then we have the opportunity to introduce it i suggest we drop the subject of escape is there anything else?i think we're all clear on the program i want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning and remember this:our men must always feel they are still commanded by us      and not by the japanese so long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves are you with me there, commander?well, l    i hope they can remain soldiers, colonel as for me, i'm just a slave a living slave queer bird  even for an ameri--he's been in isolation too long, poor chap cut off from his unit  it should be a lesson to all of us english prisoners!notice l do not say english soldiers from the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers you will finish the bridge by the 12th day of may you will work under the direction of a japanese engineer time is short  all men will work your officers will work beside you this is only just      for it is they who betrayed you by surrender your shame is their dishonor it is they who told you      better to live like a coolie then die like a hero it is they who brought you here, not i therefore, they will join you in useful labor that is all officer prisoners, collect your tools bradley, back in your place i must call your attention, colonel saito      to article 27 of the geneva convention \"belligerents may employ prisoners of war      who are fit, other than officers--\"give me the book by all means  you read english, l take it?-do you read japanese? -i'm sorry, no if it's a matter of translation, i'm sure it can be arranged you see, the code states that--stand fast in the ranks you speak to me of code?what code?the coward's code!what do you know of the soldier's code?of bushido? nothing!you are unworthy of command!since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world      we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you my officers will not do manual labor we shall see all enlisted prisoners to work sergeant major! take the men to work battalion, take up tools move to the left in columnar route  left turn!\"a\" company, by the right, quick march eyes right eyes front eyes right quick march, eyes right \"c\" company, by the right what's he up to?looks like he doesn't want any witnesses now, you will be reasonable you will order your officers to work no i will count three if by the third count      you and your officers are not on the way to work      l will give the order to fire he's going to do it believe me, he's really going to do it one i warn you, colonel saito two stop!colonel saito, i've seen and heard everything so has every man in the hospital there are too many witnesses you can't call it a mass escape  most of those men can't walk is this your soldier's code? murdering unarmed men?you see, jennings, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list i'll say this for the old man  he's got guts \"into the valley of death rode the 600 \"how's that, sir?that kind of guts also the kind they had in 1914      when officers fought with only a swagger stick -l see what you mean  -you don't see what l mean at all the kind of guts that can get us all killed excuse me, sir, i'd like to go along too arm's almost healed, sir, really it is what about him?he didn't order us not to escape, he suggested listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order here we go again colonel saito says all officers to punishment hut tell them to go not you come leave him alone!they're gonna put him in the oven for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellowfor he's a jolly good fellowand so say all of usand so say all of us and so say all of usfor he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellowfor he's a jolly good fellowand so say all of ustimber!one, two, three, four no, no, no!let go!you wish to see me?i've been trying to see you for three days it's about colonel nicholson  he's been shut up in that hut--i could have you shot those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge i knew nothing about the escape it does not matter one must even respect those who tried for a brief moment, between escape and death      they were soldiers again but it is insane to try and escape two soldiers shot, the third drowned to what end?it was an escape from reality there is your reality this shows the position work should have reached by noon today and this shows the position of actual progress because of your colonel's stubbornness      we are far behind schedule that is not all enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work yes, l have seen it  i could have them all shot then who would build your bridge?besides, are you sure it's sabotage?perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers my officers will direct them  your officers will work beside them that's for colonel nicholson to decide  as he said, it's against the rules do not speak to me of rules this is war!this is not a game of cricket he's mad, your colonel      quite mad sit down, please i have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel thank you tell him that if his officers will not work      i'll be forced to close the hospital      and your patients will work in their place and many will die, and he will be responsible go and speak to him  you have five minutes hey, the doc's going to see the old man sir    it's clipton, sir i brought you a few things -how are the men? -fine, sir, fine we scraped together a little meat and a coconut and the officers?oh, they're not so good  they're still in detention and lieutenant jennings     jennings is dead -what? -killed, attempting to escape also two others, corporal weaver and the american jennings  poor, brave lad i warned him, didn't l, clipton?look, sir, we haven't much time i'm going to clean you up a little while l talk i've got something to tell you i've just had a word with saito that man is the worst commanding officer i've ever come across actually, i think he's mad  carry on blackmail i know, sir, but he means it  i'm sure he does it's a question of face, pure and simple  and he can't give in it's still blackmail sir, you can't stand much more of this wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?the men are doing a wonderful job  they're going as slow as they dare but saito's cut their food rations      and if he makes the sick men work    well, they're going to die  that's all there is to it yes, clipton, l understand  truly but don't you see? it's a matter of principle if we give in now, there'll be no end to it  no sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere we're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way principle!no one will ever know or care what happens to us give in, sir  please!i'm adamant i will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie -time  -all right please thank those concerned everybody in the hospital contributed one piece reynolds stole the coconut we'll be able to get you something from time to time we've bribed one of your guards goodbye, sir  and good luck many thanks -clipton! -yes, sir?did you say that american chap was killed?yes, sir  shot and drowned it's insane to plan escapes three men killed, and to what end?-time! -here -here is where we must win through  -time, time!the doc just looked at us and shook his head  whatever that means means only one thing, colonel won't give in well?it's like this colonel nicholson won't give in to force it's a question of principle as medical officer, i protest to the way he's being treated it's a wonder he's still alive should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder he is responsible not i you sick?are they both mad?or am l going mad?or is it the sun?attention!battalion, attention english prisoners let us ask the question      why does the bridge not progress?you know why, because your officers are lazy!they think themselves too good to share your burden this is not just therefore, you are not happy in your work therefore, the bridge does not progress but there is another cause i do not hide the truth with deep shame and regret      l admit to you the failure      of a member of the japanese staff i refer to lieutenant miura he is a bad engineer he is unworthy of command therefore, i have removed him from his post tomorrow we begin again i shall be in personal command today we rest all work and no play make jack a dull boy as token of regard for your efforts in the future      l give presents to you all let us be happy in our work company, dismissed battalion, dismissed hey, take a look at this red cross! he's given us our--hey, he's given us our own red cross parcels \"tomorrow we begin again \"hey, harry, look they're letting the old man out most likely gonna give him another pasting good evening, colonel do you mind sitting over here?i am having rather a late supper english corned beef no, thank you produce of scotland i prefer it to sake i spent three years in london, you know i studied at the london polytechnic cheers sorry later, perhaps?perhaps i was not a good artist my father disapproved he felt l belonged in the army so l changed from art to engineering i must tell you, colonel saito i intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp i do not think you quite realize my position -l must carry out my orders  -oh, quite, quite my orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of may -l have only 1 2 weeks more  -no doubt therefore, i am compelled to use all available personnel but no officers, except in an administrative capacity but officers are working along the entire railway you know it  l know it i'm not responsible for the actions of other officers personally, i'm appalled let's not get excited will you have a cigar?no  thank you when i said all officers must work      naturally, l never meant you, the commanding officer my orders were only intended for officers below--none of my officers will do manual labor please! i was about to say:i've been thinking the matter over and have decided      to put majors and above on administrative duties      leaving only junior officers to lend a hand i'm afraid not  the convention's quite clear on that point do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?i haven't the foggiest i'd have to kill myself what would you do if you were me?i suppose if l were you      i'd have to kill myself cheers i warn you, colonel      if i am to die, others will die before me do you understand that?-major clipton did mention that  -well?that won't solve your problem but i'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution please sit down now, tell me, colonel      do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?-of course  -good now    take this bridge of yours it's quite an enormous undertaking frankly, i have grave doubts whether your lieutenant-- what's his name?-miura  -miura --is capable of tackling a job of such importance on the other hand, l have officers, reeves and hughes for instance      who have built bridges all over india the men respect them it's essential for an officer to have that respect, i'm sure you agree if he loses it, he ceases to command and what happens then? demoralization and chaos a pretty poor commander i would be if l allowed that to happen perhaps you are not aware      that the bridge is now under my personal command really? and may l ask, are you satisfied with the work?-l am not! -you've proved my point i hate the british!you are defeated but you have no shame you are stubborn but have no pride you endure but you have no courage i hate the british!pointless, going on like this stay there!stand down  stand down!battalion, attention!battalion, stand at ease please    do you know what is the date today, colonel?i'm afraid i've lost count it's the anniversary of our great victory   -   over russia in 1905  -oh, yes throughout east asia we are celebrating this date in honor of this occasion      l have given your troops a day of rest many thanks i am declaring a general amnesty you and your officers may return to your quarters as part of this amnesty      it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor he's done it!somebody deserves a medal, sir how many men in your party?well, l don't really know, sir -you don't know? -sir, 1 2, usually but, well, one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning, sir it took three or four to help him to the hospital and-- he took terrible sick, sir a corporal should always know how many men he has under him oh, yes, sir have you a nervous affliction? if not, stop making those faces at once it may be funny to you, but it's not military behavior no, sir we must put a stop to these demonstrations yes, sir -l say, reeves? -yes, sir?you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the kwai?yes, sir, half a dozen of them, in madras, bengal    if this were your bridge      how would you get it under way?get it under way, sir?well, first of all, i wouldn't build it here oh, why not?as l was trying to tell you      the japanese couldn't have picked a worse location  there's no bottom you see those piles?they're sinking our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold where would you build it?why, further downstream, sir  across those narrows then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?well, sir, not the way they're doing it  it's utter chaos, as you can see it's a lot of uncoordinated activity no teamwork some of those parties are actually working against each other yes i tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands thanks to the japanese, we now command a rabble there's no order, no discipline -our task is to rebuild the battalion  -yes, sir which isn't going to be easy but fortunately, we have the means at hand  the bridge -the bridge, sir? -the bridge we'll teach them a lesson in western efficiency that will put them to shame we'll show them what the british soldier is capable of yes  l see your point, sir i realize how difficult it's going to be here      where you can't find what you need -but there's the challenge  -l beg your pardon, sir you mean, you really want them to build the bridge?you're not usually so slow on the uptake, evans i know our men  you've got to keep them occupied fact is, if there weren't any work, we'd invent some, eh, reeves?-that we would, sir  -so we're lucky but it's going to be a proper bridge here again l know the men it's essential that they take pride in their job -right, gentlemen? -yes, sir reeves, you're the key man in this situation, as engineer tell me what you want and we'll organize it  can we make a go of it?-we'll do our best, sir  -fine we must draw up our plans      then arrange a conference with saito      and set him straight well, l think that takes care of all the procedural matters  now    oh, yes the next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned, i'm afraid sorry to tell you, we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastily      and, l have to add, incorrectly incorrectly?unfortunately, yes our engineer has made a study of the site      and has concluded that the river bottom there is too soft too soft?mud  all the work up to now has been useless -reeves, will you carry on? -yes, sir colonel, i've made tests those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold that bridge would collapse under the first train the pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch just a moment, reeves, before you get too involved colonel, do you suppose we could have a cup of tea?then l take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster      we build a new bridge, at the site picked by reeves      400 yards downstream so let's proceed to the next point i've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men -alter? -yes, i've increased it from a yard and a half of earth moved to two i was sure it would meet with your approval major hughes has all the facts  hughes, would you take over?i've done a time study, colonel saito, of the entire project as you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed i would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties just a moment  colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner would it be possible to have a meal served here?of course if we---carry on, hughes  -yes, sir if we increase the number of squads and specialize their functions      i'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent now, colonel saito, i have one more point    now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed as most of the british will work on the bridge      only a small number will be available for railway work i must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang      so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible i have already given the order we must fix the daily work quota for your men i thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire them      but isn't it best to be the same as ours?that would also create a healthy competitive spirit i have already given the order -we'll try to surpass that, won't we? -yes, sir i think that completes the agenda for this evening thank you, colonel saito, for your kind attention and are there any other questions?one question can you finish the bridge in time?frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible but we'll certainly give it a go we mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement      for which l was not to blame is there anything else?no thank you  the meeting is closed -good night  -good night i hope these japanese appreciate what we're doing for them for the moment, i'm not concerned with their appreciation -good night, clipton  -good night, sir by the way, l meant to tell you      there are trees in this forest very similar to elm and the elm piles of london bridge lasted 600 years -six hundred years, reeves? -yes, sir six hundred years that would be quite something good morning  i'm looking for an american named commander shears -oh, yes, down on the beach  -oh, thank you very much kiss!too many eyes you give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas      when all l need is love it's true  all you really need is love what makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?because i'm a civilian at heart, lover and l always follow my heart kiss how's that, commander?don't call me commander it's unromantic you're an officer yourself how would you like it if l called you lieutenant lover?let's be democratic  just call me \"sir \"yes, sir brass ahoy he wants to see you  he's all yours -i'm going for a swim  -don't leave me -commander shears? -yes my name's warden -how do you do? -sorry to intrude--that's okay, major  i'm used to it by now like a martini?that's very kind, but l think not -mind if l have one? -no how did you get that?where there's a hospital, there's alcohol oh, yes, of course  jolly good well, i'll be as brief as possible i belong to a rather rum group called force 31 6 our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens -protecting rare plants from the enemy? -not quite -sure you won't have a martini? -no, thanks we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on you could give us no end of valuable information well, i'm leaving for the states in a few days      and i've already told your people everything i know but you could help us in a rather special sense i know it's a terrible imposition      but l wonder if you could possibly come out and see us well, if you want to go over the whole thing again oh, that's very kind  lord louis will be grateful -lord who? -mountbatten -we're one of his special pigeons  -oh, i see shall we say this evening, then? about 8  i'll send a car for you this evening? out of the question well, tomorrow morning then? about 1 0?-okay, 1 0:00  -thanks very much -cheerio  -cheerio good luck thanks i know, you're terribly sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight you couldn't be more wrong general salute!present arms!-may i see your pass, sir, please?

-yes?very good of you to come -l hope they took care of you  -they certainly have thank you, staff  well, come along, then colonel green is looking forward to meeting you -fascinating place, isn't it? -utterly charming didn't realize it was a commando school we're trying to discourage the use of that word  such a melodramatic air what do you do here?sabotage, demolition, that line of country we're using p e , plastic explosives  it's wonderful stuff that pop was made with a lump half this size it's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight  here it's quite harmless until it's detonated thanks for telling me it's completely waterproof and actually plastic see? you can do what you like with it this is my place go ahead oh, i'm dying for a cup of tea -would you care for one? -no, thanks -a drink? -no, thank you -pot of tea for one, please, peter  -very good, sir do you read this?oh, l taught oriental languages at cambridge before the war i never congratulated you on your escape  lt was a good show i was lucky  if your sea-rescue plane hadn't spotted me, l wouldn't be here no, i suppose not would you like to see where you were?all right our information's rather scanty  it's mostly based on your report but we think the camp is about here say, do your people have any idea what happened to colonel nicholson?he had guts  they were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye if you're about to be shot there's not much you can do here is the river kwai, and here is the village where you were helped and here is the railway but then you must be fairly familiar with all this area not really, l was out of my head half the time the railway starts down here in singapore  malaya      bangkok, rangoon  their idea is to drive on through, into india -where was i picked up? -oh, about here the japanese aim to open the bangkok- rangoon section by the middle of may naturally, we'll try to prevent them it's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load we'll have to go smash it on the ground -how will you get there? -parachute drop, then march with demolition equipment through that jungle?our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge you see, none of us have ever been there -l don't want to discourage-- -lt should be interesting colonel green's given me the kwai bridge i'm gonna take a team in and blow it up lucky you sure you won't have tea?no, thanks  l don't want to be rude, but i've got a luncheon date at 2 -so if there are any questions     -of course, i'm sorry well, there is only one question, actually how would you feel about going back?come again?i know, under the circumstances, it's a bit much      but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose and we'd love to have you with us that's why you brought me here?to ask me this?well, frankly, yes major, i just got out of there  my escape was a miracle now you want me to go back? don't be ridiculous!this is embarrassing--i can't go back! l don't belong to you  i belong to the american navy actually, colonel green has taken the matter up with your people -with my people? -your navy's turned you over to us a signal arrived yesterday morning from your clnc pacific      authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to force 31 6 -they can't do this to me  -i'm afraid they have it was difficult to know how to break it to you but they can't do this to me  i mean it  my navy's made a mistake look  i'm not a navy commander  i'm not even an officer the whole thing's a fake  i'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class when the houston sunk, l made it ashore with a real commander later on, we ran into a japanese patrol  he was killed i figured it was just a matter of time before l was captured--so you changed uniforms with a dead man i thought officers would get better treatment that's very sensible but at saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest yes, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?i kind of got used to being a commander      so when l arrived here at the hospital      l took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward      and l said to myself, \"let's let it ride along for a while \"there were certain advantages i saw one of them on the beach anyway, that's the whole story the point is, you can't use me  you want an officer      an american commander named shears who doesn't exist when the navy learns the truth, they'll say:\"ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer \"-once that happens, i've got it made  -got it what?-made  i'd like that drink now  -of course i'll apply for a medical discharge i'll tell them i impersonated an officer      because i went off my rocker in the jungle i'm getting worse, you know  sometimes i think i'm admiral halsey it's quite a clever plan it's not only clever, it's foolproof if my navy finds out who l am      those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on this is your photograph, isn't it?-where did you get this? -lt took a bit of doing      because your people couldn't identify you finally your clnc pacific sent us a copy of your service record the photograph, fingerprints  would you care to have a look?no you see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week your navy's in an awkward position in one sense you're a blasted hero      for making an escape from the jungle but at the same time, they can't bring you home      and give you the navy cross for impersonating an officer i suppose that's why they were so happy to hand you over to us you see?hot potato as far as your present rank is concerned      we're fairly informal about those things in force 31 6 you'd have the simulated rank of major simulated major  that figures well    as long as i'm hooked, i might as well volunteer good show!oh, colonel green, sir this is major shears  he volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge really?good show!jolly good show, major!get up to sick bay, baker  this foot's infected the colonel might think i'm malingering i'm the medical officer, baker  get cracking will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?don't you worry about old nick  he knows what he's doing hello, clipton  about time you paid us a visit fine job our chaps are doing  first-rate yes  how's he behaving?he's been most reasonable since we took over -l wonder what he's thinking  -l haven't the foggiest -thanks, reeves  -right, sir what do you think?quite a challenge, isn't it?sir, are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?-are you serious? -yes, sir a good idea? take another look you don't agree morale is high? discipline has been restored?their condition has been improved?-are they a happier lot or aren't they? -yes, sir, but--they feed better and they are no longer abused -that's all true  -well, then honestly, clipton, there are times when l don't understand you at all i'll try to make myself clear, sir the fact is, what we're doing could be construed as      forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy perhaps even as treasonable activity we're prisoners of war  we haven't the right to refuse to work i understand that, sir  but must we work so well?must we build them a better bridge than they could have themselves?if you had to operate on saito, would you do your best or let him die?would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?it's important to show these people they can't break us in body or in spirit take a good look, clipton one day the war will be over i hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come      will remember how it was built, and who built it not a gang of slaves, but soldiers  british soldiers, even in captivity -yes, sir  -you're a fine doctor      but you've a lot to learn about the army hold him! hold him!use your boot! get your boot in there, will you?good morning what on earth are you people staring at?get on with your jobs!now get him with your boot!i'm awfully sorry i'm late, sir four minutes late, to be exact  you were in need of medical attention?-sir? -l was referring to the nurse oh, yes, very ingenious  warden was right sit down i asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team -ask mr  joyce to come in  -yes, sir chapman here wants joyce, but i have my doubts about him i think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation as i've told you before      in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do he's the best swimmer in the school, sir i'm well aware of your evaluation  the opinion i want is shears' all right, at ease these gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungle yes, sir you were an accountant in montreal?yes, sir  not really an accountant, sir that is, l didn't have my charter exactly what did you do?well, sir, i just checked columns and columns of figures      which people had checked before me      and then other people checked them after i had checked them -sounds a frightful bore  -sir, it was a frightful bore how did you happen to wind up here?in '39 l came over to london to enlist about two years later i volunteered for this work -you volunteered! -yes, sir  see, the regular army--go ahead, you can be frank well, the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian life they don't expect you to think think about this are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?i know how to use it, sir that's not what l meant  could you use it in cold blood?could you kill without hesitation?that's a question i've often asked myself, sir  it's worried me quite a bit and what was the answer?i don't honestly know, sir i've tried to imagine myself    i suppose i find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime it's an old army problem well, l think that's all  thank you, joyce am l to go with the team, sir?we'll let you know you see what i mean well, at least he was honest none of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises what's your opinion, shears?well, sir, he's canadian and that's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit if he wants to go, he can even take my place well, if you're all agreed on joyce, he's yours i had a report from air reconnaissance on that village there's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light -you've had parachute training? -no, sir blast  this is awkward silly, it never occurred to me well, maybe--he's right  arrange some practice jumps for him i'll pop over and check right away -all right, chapman, you can run along  -yes, sir well, feel like a sniff of air?yes, sir you don't realize what a plum you are for us your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village it's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind by the way, here's something that'll interest you  the new l pill -l pill? -l for lethal  instantaneous, painless much better than the old ones  for capture, of course you're telling me not to be taken alive i wouldn't recommend it if any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind the objective comes first in our work you want my honest evaluation of this team?i didn't want to speak out in front of them i understand, go ahead well, chapman will be fine  ice water in his veins joyce is     he'll be okay -lt's warden i don't get  -oh, why not?cambridge don and all of that it's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers--he's not without experience, you know when we lost singapore, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges and many other installations before the japs caught him -caught him? -yes -fascinating story  he-- -sir, it's most annoying in view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worthwhile -no? -if you make one jump      you've only got 50 percent chance of injury two jumps, 80 percent  three jumps, you're bound to get your packet the consensus is, the most sensible thing for major shears to do      is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best with or without parachute?oh, very good!with or without!he's in the trees!yai says we can't reach the kwai by the route you took there are too many japanese patrols  we'll swing north through heavy jungle -who's gonna lead the way? -yai himself he hates the japanese  they took all his men which means we shall have to use women bearers -women bearers  -they're very capable, i'm told he says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village there's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle -what about chapman? -yai will bury him and his chute is there something wrong?i was just thinking  you speak yai's language  i don't he's gonna lead you back to the river by a route i never took will someone tell me why i'm so indispensable to this outfit?i know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?tell that to chapman let's get cracking you're lovely lovely be happy in your work yes, sir leeches she's telling you to hold still  she'll take the leeches off your back what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?i'll teach you to say that in siamese no, that would spoil it  too much talk always spoils it what's wrong with that thing?it's taken an awful beating  i can't get a strong signal i'll tell you what's wrong it's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten  like everything else in this jungle you might as well dump it!this is radio tokyo signing off this is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy      and never volunteer for anything if we stay, we'll be up to our necks -i've got it all decoded, sir  -read it yes, sir  \"one, original bridge works reported abandoned new construction downstream from first site two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train      bangkok for rangoon with troops and v l p estimated to arrive target, a m  13th three, synchronize demolition with passage this train four, good hunting  have fun \" that's all, sir a train and a bridge!yes, sir  can we get there in time, sir?yai says we're two to three days' march from the kwai if we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 12th it's worth it for the train oh, by all means  good hunting  good show jolly good fun  jolly, jolly good if you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train well, there's always the unexpected, isn't there?heave!heave! heave!-half a pint, sir  -quinine well, we'll complete this later -clipton, we're facing a crisis  -yes, sir?i spoke with reeves and hughes  we won't finish the bridge on time we just haven't the manpower i've asked the officers to lend a hand, but even that won't do it the officers are going to work?i explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough why not ask saito for some of his men?this is our show  we must make the most of our resources that's what l came to talk to you about  the sick list there's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there don't jump to conclusions  no reflection on you      but there are always a few malingerers be honest  keep an open mind is all i ask come along, let's see don't move, don't move what's the matter with haskins?he's got amoebic dysentery and blackwater fever  temperature of 1 04 right  i see and this man?leg ulcers  l may be able to save the leg if i do more cutting tonight really want to send him out to work, sir?don't talk rot, clipton -and that man there? -his arm's infected most of their wounds won't heal properly i wonder, in his case, if fresh air and light duties      might do more good than being cooped up -light duties? -lt's not our policy to keep a man   -   just because he scratched his arm  -not our policy?well, is it?a man may not be on top of his form, but he can still make himself useful trimmings and finishing jobs  stand easy, baker tell me, you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?-anything you say, sir  -good show what about you? nothing difficult -i'll try, sir  -good man now, look here, men  lt goes without saying i'm proud of all of you but we're facing a crisis  for those of you who feel up to it      how about lending us a hand?

-yeah you're in command again now, you know thank you, major i can't understand it  it's such a solid, well-designed job not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together look those poor devils down there imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in they've got a british officer working on his knees the japanese seem to be enjoying it too if he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little if not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow      we'll have to do the job manually we'll set the charges against the piles      about three feet under the water, i should think      and run the main wire downstream to the plunger the problem is where to hide it our side of the river is quite obviously used by the japanese they'd spot it at once look  do you see those fallen tree trunks?and the grey rock just below them on that little beach?-yes, sir, l see them  -that's our key position it's on the wrong side of the river      but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance as soon as the bridge goes up      whoever's there will have to swim back it's not likely to be a pleasant swim sir, l was the best swimmer in my course yeah it looks like your line of country, then thank you, sir shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover joyce yai will be with you so you can occupy the nips   -   if they make any trouble for joyce  -right on the theory that there's always one more thing      i'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion perhaps i might even take a few potshots at the train all clear?any questions? right, we'll start as soon as it's dark they're sure to have sentries on the bridge      so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver      which means building a raft yai yai will take three women to help you build the raft one will stay here with me  all right, now get cracking shears you know, if it wasn't for my ankle, i'd take joyce's assignment i know you think he'll be all right?i think so  want me to handle it?i'd let you stay up here with the mortar if l could i'm sorry when it's over, i hope you get that medical discharge      and not the hard way thanks load beautiful yes, beautiful a first-rate job i had no idea it would turn out so well yes a beautiful creation i've been thinking tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that i've been in the service twenty-eight years in peace and war i haven't been at home more than 1 0 months in all that time still, it's been a good life i love india i wouldn't have had it any other way but there are times      when suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning and you wonder    you ask yourself      what the sum total of your life represents      what difference your being there at any time made to anything      or if it made any difference at all, really particularly in comparison with other men's careers i don't know whether that kind of thinking's healthy      but l must admit i've had some thoughts on those lines      from time to time but tonight    tonight    blast i must be off the men are preparing some sort of entertainment lovely i'm sure l speak for all of us      when i say this has been a most enjoyable evening as you know, most of you move on tomorrow      to a new camp and new construction it's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of this bridge however, you'll be glad to know that the completion      of this link in the railway      will enable us to transport the sick and disabled      to the new camp by train colonel saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind      with major clipton and the sick men      and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time now that your work here is finished      l suppose many of you feel somewhat let down that's quite understandable it's a very natural reaction but one day, in a week, a month, a year      on that day when, god willing, we all return to our homes again      you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here      in the face of great adversity what you have done should be      and l think will be      an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike you have survived with honor that, and more here in the wilderness      you have turned defeat into victory i congratulate you well done to the king and you're in business now, you got everything? sten, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife yes i'll be directly across the river the professor says there's always one more thing to do i can't think of what it could be except to wish you a long and happy life thank you what's happened?the river's gone down you can see the wire the charges!don't wait for the train do it now!if saito is correct, the train should be along in five or 1 0 minutes if you don't mind, i'll watch from up on the hill why? you'll get a better view from the bridge it's hard to explain, sir  i'd rather not be a part of it as you please  honestly, sometimes i don't understand you at all well, as you once said, sir, i've got a lot to learn about the army good morning river's gone down in the night what's he doing?colonel, there's something rather odd going on i think we better have a look around before that train comes across he's gone mad he's leading him right to it our own man!i was right  there is something going on you've got to do it, boy  you've got to do it now colonel, have you a knife? i've just realized the bridge has been mined mined?good boy!officer, sir  british officer  here to blow up the bridge -blow up the bridge? -yes, sir  british commando orders -blow up the bridge? -yes, sir  there's no time!no, no! help!help!kill him! kill him!let me go, sir! you don't understand, sir!kill him! kill him!help!kill him, joyce! kill him!you!what have l done?madness i had to do it i had to do it  they might have been captured alive it was the only thing to do!madness "}, {"title": "The Best Years of Our Lives", "year": "1946", "rating": "96", "actors": "Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Harold Russell, Myrna Loy", "director": "William Wyler", "subtitles": "no link"}, {"title": "The Silence of the Lambs", "year": "1991", "rating": "96", "actors": "Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "subtitles": "starling!starling!crawford wants to see you in his office thank you, sir - clarice  - hey     so there shouldn't be any problem if you could    - you looking for crawford?

go back to my old job, 40 cents an hour?i thought maybe i'd go to college under the gi bill of rights but my brother freddie wanted to get married and i had three unmarried sisters in an italian house, that's a terrible thing so i just went to pieces i used to walk the streets till three, four o'clock in the mornin' my poor mother    used to be so worried about me god forgive me what i'm gonna say now, but   i used to think of doin' away with myself i used to stand on the subway and, god forgive me what i'm gonna say, i   i used to feel the tracks suckin' me down under the wheels yes, i know i'm catholic, you know  even to think about suicide is a terrible sin yes, i know so then mr otari, he offered me this job in his butcher shop and   everybody pleaded with me to take it so that's what happened i didn't wanna be a butcher there's nothing wrong with being a butcher well, it's not an elegant profession it's in the lower social scale  people look down on butchers i don't well, the point is mr otari wants to sell his shop now because   it's a nice little shop  i handle his bookswhich is not unreasonable takes home net maybe $100, $150 a week point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets there's two in the neighbourhood and an a&p comin' in, at least that's the rumour marty, it's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop well, that's true  i do but it means i gotta take a loan out in a bank of $8,000 that's a big note to carry marty, i've known you for three hours, but i know you're a good butcher you're an intelligent, decent, sensitive man,and    well, i have a feeling about you like, well, like sometimes one of my kids comes to see me about something,and some of these kids, marty, in my classes, they   they have so much warmth and so much capacity well, that's the feeling i have about you if you were one of my students, i'd say to you\"go ahead and buy the butcher shop  you're a good butcher \"well, there's lots of things i could do with this shop i could organise my own supermarket get a bunch of neighbourhood merchants together that's what a lot of them are doin' what do you think?i think anything you wanna do you'll do well i'm catholic  are you catholic?yes, i am look, i only got about $3 on me now, but i only live about eight blocks from here why don't we go back to my house, i'll get some dough and we can go somewhere?i    i really should get home it's only a quarter of 12  the clock's right up there i    i really should get home  i told my father   well, i    i suppose a little while longer   do you suppose there's someplace around here i could put on some makeup?oh  hey, mac! you got a ladies' room around here?- in the back  - in the back - she told me, at the risk of her life  - she always had thin hips she told me the doctor told her, if she had more babies, it'd be at the risk of her life when she told me that, she already had six!every time i saw her, she was either goin' to the hospital or comin' from it - she was hatchin' 'em out like eggs  - her husband's a skinny fella well, i bumped into her on the street and she was as big as a barrel - i said to her \"mary   \" - lou, seen marty?- no, i ain't seen him all night  - where's everybody?\"didn't you say if you had another it'd kill you?\"and her husband's a little bit of a man well, last week on tuesday she gave birth to her baby in st elizabeth's hospital - a fine, healthy boy  nine pounds  - that's fine  so the doctor was wrong oh, no  she died right there in the hospital oh, that's a sad story - and her husband's that little fella? - that's the one that's a sad story    moving out to port chester  it's silly to think of commuting i'd have to take the subway down to 125th, then take the bus to the railroad,and then take the new york, new haven and hartford out to port chester then i think i have a 20-minute bus ride out of port chester somebody suggested that i buy a car, but i'm terrified of cars i'm always afraid i'll kill someone of course, it is a fine opportunity for me i could never hope to be the head of a department in the new york city system,especially not in the science courses of course, i'm not sure i want to be a department head it's mostly executive and administrative work on the other hand   well, anyway i told you about my fatherand, well, he depends on me a great deal well, let me tell ya, clara  i think you're kiddin' yourself i mean, i used to think about leavin' home, you know and that's what i used to say: \"my mother needs me \"but when you really come down to it, that ain't it at all we're just afraid to go out on our own  it's a big step when you go out on your own and i think you're kiddin' yourself when you say your father needs you actually, you need your father  you know what i mean?well, you know what i mean you're livin' at home now and you've got your father and mother there you could go on like that, be a little girl all your life i'm afraid of being lonely you won't be so lonely  you'll make friends right away well, actually, i don't make friends easily what are you talkin' about? you're a real likeable person you'll make friends in port chester one-two-three you'll have people visitin' you all the time  i'll visit you i'll get my brother freddie's car or you can call me up when you feel blue or i'll call you up and   it'll be real nice  don't be so afraid hey, marty!hey, marty! hey, over here!- hello, ralph  - hey, marty  come over here a minute - excuse me a minute  - sure - you'll like this guy  he's nice  - who?

we have him killed, and we feel pretty good about it or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better that's not power, though that's justice  it's different than power power is when we have everyjustification to kill,and we don't you think that's power?that's what the emperors had  a man stole something,he's brought in before the emperor,he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy he knows he's going to die and the emperor pardons him this worthless man  he lets him go i think you are drunk that's power, amon that is power amon the good i pardon you  (laughs)<i>goeth:

could you give a few words about lawrence?what, more words?the revolt in the desert   played a decisive part in the middle eastern campaign yes, sir, but about colonel lawrence himself no, no  i didn't know him well, you know mr  bentley, you know as much about lawrence as anybody yes, it was my privilege to know him and to make him known to the world he was a poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior thank you he was also the most shameless exhibitionist since barnum and bailey you, sir  who are you?my name is jackson bentley i overheard your last remark and take the gravest exception - he was a great man  - did you know him?no, i can't claim to have known him i had the honour to shake his hand in damascus knew him? i never knew him he had some minor function on my staff in cairo michael george hartley   this is a nasty, dark little room that's right we are not happy in it i am  it's better than a nasty, dark little trench - then you're a big noble fellow  - that's right here is william potter with my newspaper - here you are, tosh  - thanks would you care for one of corporal hartley's cigarettes?- is it there? - of course headlines but i bet it isn't mentioned in the times \" bedouin tribes attack turkish stronghold \"i bet that no one in this headquarters even knows it happened or would care if it did  allow me to ignite your cigarette - mr  lawrence? - yes - flimsy, sir  - thank you you'll do that once too often  it's only flesh and blood michael george hartley, you're a philosopher and you're balmy!- it damn well hurts! - certainly, it hurts what's the trick, then?the trick, william potter, is not minding that it hurts by the way, if captain gibbon should enquire for me   tell him i've gone for a chat with the general - he's balmy  - he's all right lawrence yes?you're supposed to be   do you usually wear your cap in the mess?always you should be on duty  where are you going?mustn't talk shop, freddie, not in the mess i'm going for a powwow with the general i'm not asking as your superior, but as the secretary of this mess we don't want chaps in here who should be on duty where are you going?i must say, lawrence!- sorry  - you're a clown, lawrence ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers sorry it's an intrigue, dryden i do not propose to let an overweening, crass lieutenant   thumb his nose at his commander and get away with it it doesn't sound as though he'd be any great loss don't try that, dryden  there's a principle involved there is, indeed he's of no use here in cairo he might be in arabia  he knows his stuff, sir knows the books, you mean i've already sent out colonel brighton, who's a soldier if brighton thinks we should send some arms, we will well, what more do you want?that there would be no question of lieutenant lawrence   giving military advice by god, i should hope not it's just that the arab bureau would like its own man on the spot to   to what?to make our own appraisal of the situation i'll tell you, it's my considered opinion and that of my staff   that time spent on the bedouin will be time wasted they're a nation of sheep-stealers they did attack medina and the turks made mincemeat of them we don't know that we know that they didn't take it  a storm in a teacup, a sideshow in my opinion, this whole theatre of operations is a sideshow the real war's being fought against germans, not turks not here, but on the western front in the trenches your bedouin army, or whatever it calls itself   would be a sideshow of a sideshow big things have small beginnings, sir does the arab bureau want a big thing in arabia?does the bureau think they'll sit down under us when this war is over?the bureau thinks the job of the moment, sir, is to win the war don't tell me my duty, mr  dryden - lawrence, sir  - send him in good morning, sir salute if you're insubordinate, i shall put you under arrest - it's my manner  - your what?my manner  it looks insubordinate, but it isn't i can't make out whether you're bad-mannered or just half-witted - i have the same problem, sir  - shut up the arab bureau thinks you would be of use to them in arabia why, i can't imagine you can't perform your present duties properly \" i cannot fiddle, but i can make a great state from a little city \"- what? - themistocles, sir - a greek philosopher  - i know you've been well-educated it says so in your dossier you're the kind of creature i can't stand, lawrence but i suppose i could be wrong all right, dryden  you can have him for six weeks who knows? it might even make a man of him  come in!yes, what is it?the convoy will be in port said tomorrow night - is that certain? - yes, sir there doesn't seem to be any artillery but there must be artillery!sir, this is something of an expedition he has to get to yenbo, find a guide, find the arabs and then get back he can't do that in six weeks - two months, then  - three all right, three  now, will you let me do some work, mr  dryden?thank you, sir i'd like to say, sir, that i am gratef ul for this shut up and get out sir?how can i fight a bloody war without bloody artillery?- how did you do it? - might better ask why i bothered to - because i'm the man for the job  - i just wonder about that of course i am  what is the job, by the way?find prince feisal good  and when i've found him?find out what kind of a man he is find out what his intentions are  not his immediate intentions that is colonel brighton's business, not yours i mean, his intentions in arabia altogether that's new where are they now?anywhere within 300 miles of medina they're hashemite bedouins they can cross 60 miles of desert in a day thanks  this is going to be fun lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert:bedouins and gods, and you're neither  take it from me for ordinary men, it's a burning fiery furnace no, dryden  it's going to be fun it is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun here you may drink one cup you do not drink?no i'll drink when you do i am bedu truly, now, you are a british officer?yes from cairo?yes - you did not ride from cairo? - no thank heaven  it's 900 miles  i came by boat and before?from britain?yes truly?from oxfordshire is that a desert country?no  a fat country  fat people you are not fat?no i'm different here   take it first i take you to lord feisal, then you give it to me take it now bedu food good

be difficult  the situation's bloody awf ul their morale, if they ever had any, which i doubt   the turks knocked out of them in front of medina, with howitzers they're fading away by dozens every night what i want to say is this:wherever you are and whoever you are with   you're a british officer  here's an order when we get into that camp, you're to keep your mouth shut - do you understand what i'm saying? - i understand what you're saying you'll make your appreciation and get back to--oh, my god not again i've told him! god knows i've told him \" move south, \" i've said  \"you're still in range \"they simply will not understand what modern weapons do!stand and fight  stand and fight fire back at them - who are you? - lieutenant lawrence, sir seconded to the arab bureau this is a bloody mess, sir  we'll have to move south yes, colonel, 50 miles south you were right and i was wrong we must take some thought for the wounded - we can take care of them at yenbo  - lf they can get to yenbo they can hardly come with us no  they must try to reach yenbo  lieutenant   ?lawrence you understand, lieutenant lawrence   my people are unused to explosives and machines first the guns, and now this cigarette?i'm sorry cigarette, your excellency?umph off please, your excellency  just one for two?hold it, jenkins!jenkins!lawrence?you have no servant - i don't need a servant  - no?we can do everything  light fires, cook food, wash clothes - yes, everything  - i don't doubt it - it will be very nice for you  - i can't afford it recite, then, as much of the koran as may be easy to you god knoweth that there be some among you sick   while others travel through the earth in quest for the bounties of god others do battle in his cause recite, therefore, as much as may be easy and observe the prayers this will be best and richest in the recompense seek ye the forgiveness of god verily, god is forgiving, mercif ul--greetings, ali - my lord  - sherif ali lieutenant lawrence, you have met sherif ali, i think yes, my lord and now, selim, \"the brightness \"\" by the noonday brightness   and by the night when it darkeneth   thy lord hath not forsaken thee   neither hath he been displeased and surely the future shall be better for thee than the past \"\"and in the end shall your lord be bounteous to thee   and thou be satisfied \"so?yes, colonel - i want a decision, sir  - you want me to fall back on yenbo well, you're not doing much good here, sir i'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we can't supply you here you could supply us through aqaba!aqaba!if you can get ahold of aqaba, we can supply you - but you can't! - you could you mean, the navy?the turks have 12-inch guns at aqaba, sir can you imagine what that means?yes, i can imagine put that out of your mind, sir  the navy's got other things to do oh, yes  protecting the suez canal the one essential sector of this front is and must be the canal you can see that, sir, surely i see that the canal is an essential british interest it is of little consequence to us i must ask you not to speak like that british and arab interests are one and the same possibly upon my word, sir, you're ungratef ul fall back on yenbo and we will give you equipment give you arms, advice, training, everything - guns? - a modern rifle for every man no  guns  artillery guns like the turkish guns at medina yes, give us guns and keep the training your men need training far more than guns, sir english will teach bedu to fight?we will teach them, sherif ali, to fight a modern mechanized army yes, lieutenant? what do you think about yenbo?i think it is far from damascus we'll have you in damascus, sir  never fear have you been in damascus, mr  lawrence?yes, my lord it is beautif ul, is it not?- very  - that will do, lawrence dreaming won't get you to damascus, but discipline will look, great britain is a small country, much smaller than yours small population compared with some it's small, but it's great  and why?- because it has guns  - because it has discipline because it has a navy, because of this, the english go where they please   and strike where they please  this makes them great - right  - mr  lawrence, that will do!lawrence is not your military adviser but i would like to hear his opinion damn it! who do you take your orders from?from lord feisal, in feisal's tent old fool! why turn from him to him? they are master and man my lord, i think   i think your book is right the desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped on this ocean, the bedu go where they please and strike where they please this is the way the bedu has always fought you're famed through the world for fighting this way and this is the way you should fight now i don't know i'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong fall back on yenbo, the arab rising becomes one unit in the british army - what is this to you? - you're a traitor no, colonel he is a young man, and young men are passionate they must say their say but wiser people must decide  i know you are right very well  when shall we move? the sooner the better you'll lose another 50 men tonight you tread heavily   but you speak the truth i will give you my answer tomorrow  and now   it is late colonel brighton means to put my men under european officers, does he not?in effect, my lord, yes and i must do it   because the turks have european guns but i fear to do it   upon my soul i do the english have a great hunger for desolate places i fear they hunger for arabia then you must deny it to them you are an englishman  are you not ioyal to england?to england and to other things to england and arabia both?and is that possible?i think you are another of these desert-ioving english doughty, stanhope   gordon of khartoum no arab loves the desert we love water and green trees  there is nothing in the desert and no man needs nothing or is it that you think we are something you can play with   because we are a little people, a silly people   greedy, barbarous and cruel?or do you know, lieutenant, in the arab city of cordoba   were two miles of lighting in the streets   when london was a village yes, you were great nine centuries ago time to be great again, my lord which is why my father made this war upon the turks my father, mr  lawrence, not the english but my father is old   and i   i long for the vanished gardens of cordoba however, before the gardens must come the fighting to be great again, it seems that we need the english   or   or?what no man can provide, mr  lawrence we need a miracle aqaba aqaba from the land you are mad to come to aqaba by land we should have to cross the nef ud desert that's right the nef ud cannot be crossed i'll cross it if you will you? it takes more than a compass, englishman the nef ud is the worst place god created i can't answer for the place  only for myself fifty men?fifty? against aqaba?if 50 men came out of the nef ud   they would be 50 men other men might join the howeitat are there, i hear the howeitat are brigands  they'll sell themselves to anyone - good fighters, though  - good--yes  there are guns at aqaba they face the sea, sherif ali, and cannot be turned around from the landward side, there are no guns at aqaba with good reason  it cannot be approached from the landward side certainly the turks don't dream of it aqaba's over there it's only a matter of going you are mad and where are you going, lieutenant?with 50 of my men to work your miracle blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a journey - who told you? - ali did why not you?you are falling back from yenbo, sir?yes, i must but i will spare these to you did ali break confidence to tell me?sherif ali owes you his allegiance, my lord yet you did not tell colonel brighton no since you do know   we can claim to arrive in the name of feisal of mecca yes, lieutenant lawrence, you may claim it but in whose name do you ride?sherif, i caught them  they have tracked us they were here  i caught them why are you here? boy!to serve lord lawrence, sherif this is true, lawrence  they do wish it you have been tracking us - you were told to stay  - no, sherif our camel strayed  we followed her she led us here to be lord lawrence's servants - it is the will of allah  - blasphemy don't do that no, lawrence, these are not servants  these are outcasts, parent-less be warned  they are not suitable they sound very suitable  you can ride with the baggage these are not servants  these are worshippers one shilling, every week?that is fair - each? - no - that is too much  - all right they will be lucky for you  allah

wasted from now on, we must travel by night   and rest while it is too hot to travel a few hours each day why don't we start now?no  we will rest now three hours fine i'll wake you do we rest here?there is no rest now short of water the other side of that and how much of that is there?i'm not sure but however much, it must be crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up this is the sun's anvil

resemblance alas, you resemble your father - auda flatters me  - you are easily flattered i knew your father well did you know your own?we are 50, you are two  how if we shot you down?why, then you have a blood feud with the howeitat - do you desire it? - not the generals in cairo   nor the sultan himself desire that call off your men this honours the unworthy i've only just begun to teach him and what are you teaching him today? howeitat hospitality?be not clever with me, english - who is he? - a friend of prince feisal's - so you desire my hospitality? - yes is he your tongue?we do desire it then it is given, if you will take it i'm at my summer camp, a poor place well, to me it seems a poor place  some men find it marvellous tomorrow, maybe i will allow the turks to buy you, friends of feisal but   dine with me dine with auda, english dine with the howeitat, harith it is my pleasure that you dine with me in wadi rumm!this thing you work against aqaba   what profit do you hope from it?we work it for feisal of mecca the harith do not work for profit well, if it is in a man to be a servant, sherif ali   he could find worse masters than feisal but i    i cannot serve you permit the turks to stay in aqaba yes, it is my pleasure we do not work this thing for feisal no?- for the english, then? - for the arabs the arabs?the howeitat, ageyil, ruala, beni sahkr, these i know i have even heard of the harith but the arabs?what tribe is that?they're a tribe of slaves  they serve the turks well, they are nothing to me my tribe is the howeitat who work only for profit who work at auda's pleasure and auda's pleasure is to serve the turks serve?i serve?it is the servant who takes money i am auda abu tayi - does auda serve? - no!- does auda abu tayi serve? - no!i carry 23 great wounds, all got in battle 75 men have i killed with my own hands, in battle i scatter, i burn my enemies tents  i take away their flocks and herds the turks pay me a golden treasure, yet i am poor!because i am a river to my people is that service?no and yet now it seems auda has grown old and lost his taste for fighting it is well you say it in my tent, thou old tulip yet this is a tulip that the turks could not buy why should they wish to?now   i will tell you what they pay me, and you will tell me if this is   a servant's wages they pay me, month by month   100 golden guineas 150, auda - who told you that? - i have long ears and a long tongue between them 100, 150, what matters? it's a trifle a trifle which they take f rom a great box they have in aqaba - in aqaba? - where else?you trouble me like women friends, we've been foolish  auda won't come to aqaba - for money? - no - for feisal? - no!nor to drive away the turks he will come   because it is his pleasure thy mother mated with a scorpion make god your agent!aqaba!aqaba!god be with you god be with you god be with you god be with you yes aqaba tomorrow we will go and get it - do you think we shall? - yes if you are right about the guns he killed  he dies this is the end of aqaba - one of our men murdered auda's man  - why?theft? blood feud? it makes no matter why ali!it is an ancient wound i didn't come here to watch a tribal bloodbath it is the law, lawrence the law says the man must die if he dies, will that content the howeitat?yes sherif ali!if none of lord auda's men harms any of yours   -    will that content the harith? - yes then i will execute the law i have no tribe and no one is offended gasim did you do it?well, lawrence   what ails the englishman?that that he killed was the man he brought out of the nef ud it was written, then better to have left him it was execution, lawrence  no shame in that besides, it was necessary you gave life and you took it the writing is still yours auda abu tayi!the miracle is accomplished garlands for the conqueror tribute for the prince  flowers for the man i'm none of those things, ali - what, then? - don't know thanks my god, i love this country what!no gold in aqaba!auda, i found it!that's a pity ali, get a message down the coast to yenbo tell feisal to find boats, any boats   and bring the arab army here to aqaba, quickly and

aqaba, \" the generals would laugh i see in cairo you will put off these funny clothes you'll wear trousers and tell stories ofour quaintness and barbarity   and then they will believe you you're an ignorant man paper paper!there is no gold in aqaba no gold no great box!did auda come to aqaba for gold?for my pleasure, as you said but gold is honorable   and lawrence promised gold lawrence lied

else?yes aqaba's linked with medina do you think we should shift them out of medina now?no  i think you should leave them there you acted without orders, you know shouldn't officers use their initiative at all times?not really  it's awfully dangerous yes, i know already?yes i'm promoting you major i don't think that's a very good idea i didn't ask you  i want you to go back   and carry on

dryden?before he did it, sir, i'd have said it couldn't be done - brighton? - i know what he thinks i think you should recommend a decoration, sir i don't think it matters what his motives were it was a brilliant bit of soldiering - mr  perkins! - sir!let's have a drink, gentlemen - you've heard about this, mr  perkins? - yes, sir - what do you think about it? - bloody marvellous, sir  well done - thank you, mr  perkins  - sir!come on, then you're a clever man, sir no, but i know a good thing when i see one that's fair, surely?if i need a breakthrough to jerusalem, i must concentrate, not dissipate - bravo  - you know better?i fight like clausewitz, then you fight like saxe we should do very well indeed, shouldn't we?easy, gentlemen, please - give us a drink  - of course, sir i'm here at the invitation of major lawrence tracy shall we go outside?so you hold bound the turkish desert army?yes with 1000 arabs?1000 arabs means 1000 knives delivered anywhere, day or night it means 1000 camels that means 1000 packs of high explosives and 1000 crack rifles we can cross arabia while johnny turk is still turning round i'll smash his railways while he mends, i'll smash them somewhere else in 13 weeks i can have arabia in chaos you are going back, then?yes of course i'm going back well, if we can see it, so can the turk if he finds he's using four divisions to fend off a handf ul of bandits   he'll withdraw he daren't withdraw  arabia's part of his empire if he gets out now, he'll never get back again - i wonder who will  - no one will arabia's for the arabs now that's what i've told them anyway that's what they think - that's why they're fighting  - oh, surely they've only one suspicion that we'll let them drive the turks out and then move in ourselves i've told them that that's false, that we have no ambitions in arabia have we?i'm not a politician, thank god have we any ambition in arabia, dryden?difficult question, sir i want to know, sir, if i can tell them in your name   that we've no ambitions in arabia certainly 2000 small arms, not enough  i need five right money  it'll have to be sovereigns  they don't like paper - instructors for the lewis guns  - right more money - how much more? - 25, 000 now  a lot more later - dryden? - it can be done, sir a couple of armoured cars right field artillery right i'll give you every blessed thing i can   because i know you'll use it  congratulations thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen congratulations!are you really going to give them artillery, sir?i was wondering that, sir might be difficult to get it back give them artillery and you've made them independent then i can't give it to them, can i?- for you to say  - no, it's not i've got orders to obey, thank god not like that poor devil he's riding the whirlwind let's hope we're not excuse me, friend  who do these bags belong to?to prince feisal - you're not prince feisal? - no you know him though?he is my master  i am his servant can you read?chicago courier is my paper, but my work is syndicated in america i understood so from your letter, mr  bentley now   - where can i find major lawrence? - is that what you have come for?not altogether, sir, no well, mr  bentley, you will find major lawrence with my army that's what i meant, sir  where can i find your army?i don't know - last week they were near el ghira  - ghira?yes, i fear you have a long journey  can you ride a camel?- i've never tried  - take a mule a void mellaha, the turks are there in mellaha now? they move fast they do but not so fast as we do, you will find myself   i am going to cairo - as you know  - yes there's work for me there of a different kind yes i know you've been given no artillery - that is so  - you're handicapped?it restricts us to small things it's intended to do you know general allenby?watch out for allenby  he's a slim customer - excuse me? - a clever man slim customer  it's very good i'll certainly watch out for him  you're being very sympathetic your highness, we americans were once a colonial people we naturally feel sympathetic to any people   who struggle for their freedom very gratifying also, my interests are the same as yours  you want your story told i badly want a story to tell ah, now you are talking turkey, are you not?i will give you a guide and a letter and before i leave here   which must be presently   i will have some facts and figures put on paper for you you know that we are destroying the turkish railways i do, sir major lawrence is in charge of all this, is he?my army is made up of tribes the tribes are led by the tribal leaders your people do think very highly of major lawrence?oh, yes  and the rightly in this country, mr  bentley   the man who gives victory in battle is prized   beyond every other man one figure i can give you f rom my head   because it never leaves my head since starting this campaign four months ago, we have lost   37 wounded   156 dead you remark the disproportion between our dead and wounded yeah four times as many that's because those too badly wounded to bring away, we ourselves kill we leave no wounded for the turks - you mean   ? - we leave no wounded for the turks in their eyes, we are not soldiers but rebels rebels, wounded or whole, are not protected by the geneva code   and are treated harshly how harshly?more harshly than i hope you can imagine i see our own prisoners are taken care of until the british   can relieve us of them, according to the code - i should like you to notice that  - yes, sir is that the influence of major lawrence?why should you suppose?it's just that i heard in cairo that   major lawrence has a horror of bloodshed that is exactly so with major lawrence, mercy is a passion with me, it is merely good manners you may judge which motive is the more reliable - and now, perhaps    - oh, sure, sure thank you, sir can you manage the letter--?i'll do everything i have said   if you will tell me truly the nature of your interest   in my people and major lawrence it's very simple, sir  i'm looking for a hero indeed  you do not seem a romantic man oh, no but influential men back home believe it's time for america   to lend her weight to the struggle against germany and turkey i've been sent to find material to show our people that this war is   - enjoyable? - hardly that, sir but to show it in its more adventurous

be very glad to do   may i put two questions to you, straight?i'd be interested to hear you put a question straight one what, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war?they hope to gain their freedom freedom \"they hope to gain their freedom \"- there's one born every minute  - they're going to get it i'm going to give it to them the second question?well, i was going to ask   what is it that attracts you personally to the desert?it's clean well, now   that's a very illuminating answer may i   take one farewell picture?i gave math budad two lamps for it one clock for two lamps a fair bargain fair? i robbed him trash i must find something honorable honorable?the year is running out, brighton i must find something honorable now you may blow up my train and what will you do now?now i go home  they will carry my toys they will carry my toys too, see?major lawrence will campaign this winter but you got what you wanted, so you're going home, is that it?of course  when lawrence has got what he wants, he will go home when you've got what you want, you will go home no, i shan't, auda then you are a fool maybe  but i am not a deserter give thanks to god, brighton   that when he made you a fool, he gave you a fool's face you are an impudent rascal i must go, lawrence, before i soil myself with a fool's blood like talking to a brick wall so what will you do now? what can you do?i'll go north that's what allenby wants allenby wanted the arab army behind deraa then that's where i'll take it tell allenby to hurry up, or we'll be in deraa before he's in jerusalem

do?what would you recommend?he hasn't 1l10 so many men, sir he's lied, in fact yes and no  he doesn't claim to have done anything he hasn't done then there is an arab north army - no, sir, he has lied about that  - any idea why?- it's his army, i suppose  - it's prince feisal's army do you think he's gone native, harry?no he would if he could, i think - not my line of country  - it doesn't matter  just curious what matters is i believed it the turks believe it they are offering 20, 000 pounds for him good heavens - shouldn't say he had long to live  - well, he's a brave man--surely  if he's still going north with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts i wonder if they'd offer that much for me what about next year? will they still come back?i wouldn't be surprised - they think he's a kind of prophet  - they do or he does?- now may i speak? - yes one more failure and you will find yourself alone - i do not include myself  - i do not include the others so say they love you the more reason to be thrifty with them give them something to do that can be done  but you, no they must move mountains, walk on water that's right  that's right who are you to know what can be done?if we'd done what you thought could be done, we'd be in yenbo now whatever i ask them to do can be done  they know that if you don't do you think i'm just anybody?do you?my friends, who will walk on water with me?- who will come with me into deraa? - deraa is garrisoned will you take 20 against 2000?- i'll go by myself if i have to  - why?i told the english generals   the arab revolt would be in deraa when they'd be in jerusalem or perhaps you are here   for the english generals who says this?rumour that is not an argument oh, argument this afternoon i will take the arab revolt into deraa   while the arabs argue can you pass for an arab in an arab town?yes  if one of you would lend me some dirty clothes it's madness what are you looking for?some way to announce myself be patient with him, god - do you not see how they look at you? - peace, ali, i am invisible halt!walk on - halt! - walk on you and you you you have blue eyes - i say you have blue eyes  - yes, effendi - are you circassian? - yes, effendi how old are you?twenty-seven, effendi i think you look older  you have had a lot of experience it's an interesting face i am surrounded by cattle he wouldn't know an interesting face f rom a sow's belly i have been is deraa now for three and a half years if they posted me to the dark side of the moon, i could not be more   isolated you haven't the least idea what i'm talking about no, effendi have you?no that would be too   lucky where did you get that?- it's old, effendi  - no, this is recent - you are a deserter  - no, effendi yes, you are a deserter but from which army?not that it matters at all a man cannot be always in uniform your skin is very fair beat him to me!sleep sleep eat eat you have a body, like other men good then sleep better?much better  you were right rest, rest  can you not learn?oh, i've learned all right i'm going, ali - why? - why?heavens why?i've come to the end of myself, i suppose and the end of the arab revolt?i'm not the arab revolt, ali  i'm not even arab a man can be whatever he wants  you said i'm sorry  i thought it was true you proved it look, ali  look that's me  what colour is it? that's me and there's nothing i can do about it a man can do whatever he wants  you said he can   but he can't want what he wants this is the stuff that decides what he wants you may as well know  i would've told them anything i would've told them who i am  i would've told them where you were - i tried to  - so would any man well, any man is what i am and i'm going back to allenby to ask him for a job   that any man can do allenby's in jerusalem - i'll make easy stages  - you?oh, yes  easy stages look, ali, i think i see a way of being just   ordinarily   happy can i take this?it is not clean no, but it's warm and these   having led them here, have you no care for them?you lead them  they're yours  trust your own people and let me go back to mine - i say, don't forget those form fives  - all right mind if i join you?honoured, sir - good to be back  - we heard you were, sir - what's doing out there? - where?- arabia? - well, yes, sir nothing much  wrong time of year  what's doing here?we're settling in  we built a squash court jolly good well, i have to go up there it's borrowed  someone pinched mine bloody wogs yes, probably jolly good about the squash court lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?morning - good morning  - good to be back - i'll believe you, sir  - no, really it is hello morning  you're to go right in lawrence or is it major lawrence?sir well, general, i will leave you major lawrence doubtless has reports to make   about my people and their weakness   and the need to keep them in the british interest and the french interest too  we must not forget the french i told you, no such treaty exists yes, general, you have lied most bravely, but not convincingly i know this treaty does exist treaty, sir?he does it better than you, general but then, of course, he is almost an arab you really don't know?then what the devil's this?it's my request for release from arabia, sir why? are you sure you haven't heard of the sykes-picot treaty?no - i can guess  - don't guess  tell him well, now   mr  sykes is as english civil servant monsieur picot is a french civil servant mr  sykes and monsieur picot met, and they agreed that after the war   france and england should share the turkish empire including arabia they signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir an agreement to that effect there may be honour among thieves, but there's none in politicians and let's have no displays of indignation you may not have known, but you certainly had suspicions if we've told lies, you've told half-lies and a man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth but a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it the truth is i'm an ordinary man you might have told me that, dryden and i want an ordinary job, sir that's my reason for resigning it's personal - personal? - yes, sir personal? you're a serving officer in the field and as it happens, a damned important one  are you mad?no, and if you don't mind, i'd rather not go mad that's my reason too look, i'm making my big push on damascus the 16th of next month   and you are part of it can you understand that? you're an important part of the big push!i don't want to be part of your big push!what about your arab friends?i have no arab friends! i don't want arab friends!what in hell do you want, lawrence?i've told you, i just want my ration of common humanity - lawrence  - yes?nothing  sorry i interrupted, sir that's all right  thank you, mr  dryden thank you, sir why don't we   ?there's blood on your back - do you want a doctor? - no tell me what happened say, what goes on in there?- nothing  - oh, come on!- no, really  nothing at all  - is the man in trouble?i expect so  we all have troubles  life's a vale of troubles let me know if the man's in trouble  i've got a claim in that man - what claim? - i've made that boy a hero when the war's over, he can be anything he wants yes  well, at the moment he wants to be somebody else will you kindly allow me to pass?walk away, dryden, walk away always walking away, aren't you?well, i'll tell you it's a clash of temperament that's going on in there inevitably, one of them's half-mad   and the other, wholly unscrupulous i believe your name will be a household word   when you'd have to go to the war museum to find who allenby was you're the most extraordinary man i ever met leave me alone - leave me alone  - that's a feeble thing to say - i know i'm not ordinary  - that's not what i'm saying all right, i'm extraordinary what of it?not many people have a destiny, lawrence it's a terrible thing for a man to funk it if he has are you speaking from experience?no you're guessing, then suppose you're wrong why suppose that? we both know i'm right - yes  i said, yes  - after all--the 16th?can you do it? i'll give you a lot of money - artillery? - i can't they won't be coming for money, not the best of them they'll be coming for damascus which i'm going to give them that's all i want all you want is someone holding down the turkish right but i'm going to give them damascus  we'll get there before you do and when we've got it, we'll keep it tell the politicians to burn their paper now fair enough fair? what's fair got to do with it?it's going to happen i shall want quite a lot of money all there is not that much the best of them won't come for money they'll come for me no pictures!it's not for you, it's for lawrence he doesn't mind having his picture taken  he doesn't mind at all well, there's only one lawrence have you met lawrence since he's come back?yes - changed, hasn't he? - no oh, i'd say he had  different man, i'd say what did that turkish general do to him in deraa?he was the same man after deraa  the same man, humbled what did the english do to him in jerusalem?search me  ask lawrence - i did  - what did he say?he laughed he told me to gather the harith here he offered me money did you take it?no  but many did - what is this? - this is my bodyguard there is not a man without a price on his head - there's a price on my head too  - but these are murderers the sheiks will hang these men these men are mine lawrence, these things know nothing of the arab revolt - you, ghitan of aleppo  - sherif?- where do we ride? - damascus, sherif aye, but for what?sherif, for lawrence - you have bought these things  - i bought half the men here, ali that is different  these are not ordinary men i don't want ordinary men  hut!damascus!damascus! damascus!damascus! damascus!very well, gentlemen  the cavalry's gone through mazril and deraa very good, by the way  very good indeed  now your turn if the enemy's retreating in any order, which we'll assume--certainly he can't be far from mallud   in which case i can have him within range by 0900 hours tomorrow splendid  philip these are the last infantry supports going up now but mallud, we could have the fusiliers there by wednesday that'll do for now  the guns are what matter any questions?this arab army on the right, sir, what's it consist of?irregular cavalry, sir  about 2000 where are they now?- can only know by being with them  - then get with them  i want to know pound them, charley pound them god help the men who lie under that they're turks god help them well, he's got the bit between his teeth all right cocky?more than cocky, sir he's got the bit between his teeth all right i tell you, sir, i think he'll get to damascus before we do - unless    - unless?well, there's a turkish column in front of him, out of mazril - what do the turks have in mazril? - a brigade, sir i wonder where they are now no prisoners damascus, lawrence lawrence, not this go round  damascus, lawrence, damascus no prisoners this was talaal's village talaal!talaal!no prisoners!no prisoners!god god god!enough  enough! make them stop!major!major lawrence!jesus wept jesus wept does it surprise you, mr  bentley?surely you know the arabs are a barbarous people barbarous and cruel who but they?who but they?oh, you rotten man here, let me take your rotten bloody picture for the rotten bloody newspapers these were cut last night, lawrence, in damascus damascus!take them to sherif ali tell him remind him - is allenby in damascus? - near tell sherif ali that they are not ripe general salute!present arms!port arms!lawrence is behind it, sir the whole town is plastered with the arab flag - when? - a day and a night, sir they've been here a day and a night they've occupied the town  they've done it he's set up his own headquarters in the town hall what else beside the town hall?telephone exchange, post office, powerhouse   hospitals, fire station  everything, sir they call themselves the arab national council   and they're in the town hall well, they're your pigeon, harry what should we do?get them out of it, sir, quick time how about that, dryden?not unless you want a full-scale rising - what, then? - when will feisal be in damascus?by special train in two days' time two days two days is what you asked for  i can't keep him out any longer - isn't it enough? - yes - ample, i should think  - we can't just do nothing why not? it's usually best  get us something to drink, tracey and tracey, all troops to remain quartered until further orders does that apply to technical units?technical units particularly yes, sir medicals too, sir?i'm af raid so, harry medicals too we here   are neither harith nor howeitat   nor any other tribe, but arabs   of the arab council, acting for prince feisal he insulted me sherif ali said that the telephones are in the care of the howeitat   and they have ceased to work  and this is true they will not work because they are given no electricity the electricity is in the care of the harith if you answer, there will be bloodshed you speak to me of bloodshed?i ask pardon of auda abu tayi humbly?humbly, harith?yes, humbly this is a new trick why is there no electricity?i have been to that electrical house, lawrence there are three large machines he means generators!so one of them is burning they are of an incredible size, but helpless it is so of all machines let them burn  what need of telephones?- the need is absolute  - then we need english engineers no  take english engineers and you take english government take--fire has broken out - where? - the jinsibi district - it is not a district that matters  - it will spread!then use the fire brigade!we have tried, but there is no force in the water then you must carry it - the ruala do not carry water  - what else are they good for?we will hear petitions this afternoon this afternoon!- i'll take this up after the war  - surely we should do something, sir - it's an old man's sport  - are you an old man, sir?all i can say is, sir, it's a heavy responsibility sorry, sir maybe it's the bulb no, sir it's the power they're leaving that's it, then marvellous-iooking beggars, aren't they?leave it, lawrence  come with me - come where? - back i know your heart what is it?is it this?i tell you, this is nothing is it the blood?the desert has dried up more blood than you could think of i pray that i may never see the desert again hear me, god you will come  there is only the desert for you what about you?no, i shall stay here and learn politics a very low occupation i had not thought of it when i met you you have tried very hard to give us damascus it's what i came for and then   it would be something yes much - he is your friend? - take your hand away - you love him  - i fear him then why do you weep?if i fear him, who love him   how must he fear himself, who hates himself?take your hand away, howeitat!so you are not yet entirely politician not yet well, these are new tricks, and i am an old dog and allah be thanked i'll tell thee what   being an arab will be thornier than you suppose, harith in all my years, i've never seen anything like it it comes within the jurisdiction of the arab council under the circumstances, i think i must take over  immediately under any circumstances at all, you must obey your orders no, sir, i will not control yourself now, go over to the town hall and see what they say we did what we could in the civic hospitals but you forgot the turkish military hospital it has 600 beds  there are about 2000 turkish wounded in it all of whom are the responsibility of your precious arab council what's it like?this is outrageous!outrageous!outrageous!you filthy little wog!my friend lawrence, if i may call him that \" my friend lawrence \"how many men will claim the right to use that phrase? how proudly he longs for the greenness of his native land he pines for the gothic cottages of surrey, is it not?already in imagination, he catches trout   and all the activities of the english gentleman that's me you're describing, sir, not colonel lawrence you're promoted colonel yes  what for?take the honour, colonel  be a little kind as a colonel, you'll have a cabin to yourself on the boat home then, thank you well, then   godspeed there's nothing further here for a warrior we drive bargains  old men's work young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men courage and hope for the future then old men make the peace and the vices of peace are the vices of old men mistrust and caution it must be so what i owe you is beyond evaluation the powerhouse, the telephone exchange, these i concede the pumping plant i must retain if you retain it, there will be no water - i shall be glad of assistance  - then you must bring down your flag i shall not, and if your men attempt it, my men will resist it - have you men? - enough of that it's a thing that makes an ugly incident i'm sure your government   does not wish to appear at the peace conference as an aggressor i say!it's lawrence, isn't it?may i shake your hand, sir?just want to be able to say i'd done it, sir haven't we met before?don't think so, sir no, no, sir, i should remember that it is widely known the arab council took power in my name they have no power  it's illusory illusions can be very powerf ul particularly   when they take this form the world is delighted at the picture of damascus   liberated by the arab army led, may i remind you, by a british-serving officer ah, yes  but then lawrence is a sword with two edges we are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?i thought i was a hard man, sir you are merely a general i must be a king excuse me, sir well?well   it seems we're to have a british waterworks   with an arab flag on it do you think it was worth it?not my business  thank god i'm a soldier yes, sir so you keep saying you, i suspect   are chief architect of this compromise - what do you think? - me, your highness?on the whole, i wish i'd stayed in tunbridge wells well, sir  going home home, sir goodbye, dolly, i must leave youthough it breaks my heart to go"}, {"title": "Rebecca", "year": "1940", "rating": "100", "actors": "Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, George Sanders", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock",

barred to me then, like all dreamers,i was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powersand passed like a spirit through the barrier before me the drive wound away in front of me,twisting and turning as it had always done but as i advanced,i was aware that a change had come upon it nature had come into her own again, and little by littlehad encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers on and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive,and finally, there was manderley manderley, secretive and silent time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy,and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows and then a cloud came upon the moonand hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face the illusion went with it i looked upon a desolate shellwith no whisper of the past about its staring walls we can never go back to manderley again that much is certain but sometimes in my dreams, i do go backto the strange days of my lifewhich began for me in the south of france no! stop!what the devil are you shouting about?who are you? what are you staring at?i'm sorry, i didn't mean to stare, but i    i only thought   oh, you did, did you? well, what are you doing here?i was only walking well, get on with your walking  don't hang about here screaming i'll never come to monte carlo out of season again not a single well-known personality in the hotel stone cold  waiter!garcon! call him  tell him to get me some   why, it's max de winter how do you do?i'm edythe van hopper  it's so nice to run into you here,just when i was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in monte but do sit down and have some coffee mr  de winter is having some coffee with me go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup i'm afraid i must contradict you you shall both have coffee with me garcon  coffee, please - cigarette? - no, thank you you know, i recognized you as soon as you came in,though i haven't seen you since that night at the casino at palm beach perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me are you playing the tables much here at monte?no  i'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago i can well understand that as for me, if i had a home like manderley,i should certainly never come to monte i hear it's one of the biggest places in that part of the country,and you just can't beat it for beauty what do you think of monte carlo? or don't you think of it at all?well, i think it's rather artificial she's spoiled, mr  de winter, that's her trouble most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see monte wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?now that we've found each other again, i hope i shall see something of you you must come and have a drink in my suite i hope they've given you a good room the place is empty, so if you're uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss your valet has unpacked for you, i suppose?i'm afraid i don't possess one  perhaps you would like to do it for me?well, i    i hardly think   perhaps you could make yourself useful to mr  de winterif he wants anything done you're a capable child in many ways that's a charming suggestion, but i'm afraid i cling to the old motto,\"he travels fastest who travels alone  \" perhaps you've not heard it  good night what do you make of that?do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?come, don't sit there gawking, let's go upstairs - have you got the key? - yes, mrs  van hopper i remember, when i was younger, there was a well-known writerwho used to dart down the back way whenever he saw me coming i suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself well, c'est la vie by the way, my dear, don't think that i mean to be unkind,but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with mr  de winter your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me,and i'm sure it did him  men loathe that sort of thing oh, come, don't sulk  after all, i am responsible for your behavior here perhaps he didn't notice it poor thing, i suppose he just can't get over his wife's death they say he simply adored her oh    how awkward of me what a stupid thing to do  oh, i'm so sorry please don't bother  it doesn't really matter no, leave that, leave that  go and lay another place at my table - mademoiselle will have lunch with me  - oh, but i couldn't possibly - why not? - oh, well, please don't be polite  i   it's very kind of you but i'll be all right if they just change the cloth i wasn't being polite i should have asked you to have lunch with meeven if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily come along we needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it well, thank you very much oh, i    i'll just have some scrambled eggs oui, mademoiselle - what's happened to your friend? - she's ill in bed with a cold i'm sorry i was so rude to you yesterday the only excuse i can offer is that i've become boorish through living alone you weren't really  you simply wanted to be alone and   tell me, is mrs  van hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?no, she's my employer  i'm what is known as \"a paid companion  \"i didn't know companionship could be bought i looked at the word \"companion\" in the dictionary once it said, \"a friend of the bosom  \"i don't envy you the privilege well, she's very kind, really, and i have to earn my living haven't you any family?no  my mother died years and years ago,and there was only my father, and he died last summer and then i took this job how rotten for you yes, it was rather, because, you see, we got on so well together you and your father?yes  he was a lovely person, very unusual - what was he? - a painter ah! was he a good one?well, i thought so, but people didn't understand him yes, that's often the trouble he painted trees  at least, it was one tree you mean, he painted the same tree over and over again?yes  you see, he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thingor place or person, you should stick to it do you think that's really silly?not at all  i'm a firm believer in that myself and what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?well, i sat with him and i sketched a little  i don't do it very well, though were you going sketching this afternoon?yes - where? - well, i haven't made up my mind i'll drive you somewhere in the car oh, no, please, i didn't mean   oh, nonsense  finish up that mess, and we'll get along thank you  it's very kind of you, but i'm not very hungry come on  eat it up like a good girl you've taken long enough for that sketch i shall expect a really fine work of art oh, no, don't look at it  it's not nearly good enough well, it can't be as bad as all that  now don't rub it all out let me see it first well, it's the perspective  i never can get it right let me see it, let me see it  oh, dear tell me, is it the perspective that gives my nose that curioustwist in the middle?well, you're not a very easy subject to sketch  your   your expression keeps changing all the time does it?well, i'd    i'd concentrate on the view instead, if i were you much more worthwhile it rather reminds me of our coastline at home  do you know cornwall at all?yes, i went there once with my father on holiday  i was in a shop once,and i saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea i asked whose house it was, and the old lady said, \"that's manderley  \"i felt ashamed for not knowing manderley is beautiful but to me, it's just the place where i was born,and have lived in all my life but now, i don't suppose i shall ever see it again we're lucky not to be home during the bad weather, aren't we?i can't ever remember enjoying swimming in england till june, can you?the water's so warm here that i could stay in all day there's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here last year i never have any fear of drowning  have you?come, i'll take you home oh, yes, i know mr  de winter well  i knew his wife, too before she married, she was the beautiful rebecca hildreth, you know she was drowned, poor dear, while she was sailing near manderley he never talks about it, of course, but he's a broken

de winter?why, certainly this isn't at all your idea of a proposal, is it?it should be in a conservatory,you in a white frock, with a red rose in your hand,and a violin playing in the distance,and i should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree poor darling  never mind i don't mind don't worry  don't worry  you won't have to say a word i'm so glad you called me, mr  de winter i was making a hasty departure it was so rude of me not to let you know but a cable came this morning announcing that my daughteris engaged to be married that's rather a coincidence, mrs  van hopper i asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement you don't mean it  how perfectly wonderful how romantic  who is the lucky lady?i apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way i do hope it won't inconvenience you too greatly when did all this happen?just now, mrs  van hopper  just a few minutes ago i simply can't believe it and i suppose i ought to scold youfor not having breathed a word of all of this to me what am i thinking of?i should give you both my congratulations and my blessings i'm very happy for you both - when and where is the wedding to be? - here, as soon as possible a whirlwind romance  splendid! i can easily postpone my sailing for a week this poor child has no mother,so i shall take responsibility for all the arrangements trousseau, reception and everything, and i'll give the bride away but our luggage go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car just a minute  we're most grateful, mrs  van hopper,but i think we'd both prefer to have it all as quiet as possible and i couldn't possibly allow you to change your sailing plans - oh, but    - no, no, no dear, i'll go down and see that your luggage is brought back thank you, maxim so this is what's been happening during my illness tennis lessons, my foot i suppose i've to hand it to you for a fast worker how did you manage it?still waters certainly run deep tell me, have you been doing anything you shouldn't?- i don't know what you mean  - well, never mind i always did say that englishmen have strange tastes you certainly have your work cut out as mistress of manderley to be perfectly frank with you, my dear, i can't see you doing it you haven't the experience,you haven't the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady of course you know why he's marrying you, don't you?you haven't flattered yourself that he's in love with you?fact is, that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent,he nearly went off his head he just couldn't go on living alone you'd better leave, mrs  van hopper  you'll miss your train mrs  de winter goodbye, my dear, and good luck!monsieur!what is he saying?he says i've forgotten the proof that we're married good heavens somebody else had the same idea - isn't she sweet? - yes you'd have liked a bridal veil, wouldn't you?or at least   oh, maxim, how lovely how perfectly lovely perfectly lovely welcome home, mr  de winter  thank you, smith - cold, darling? - yes, just a little bit there's no need to be frightened, you know just be yourself, and they'll all adore you you don't have to worry about the

orders, sir oh  sorry about this  it won't take long this is mrs  danvers how do you do?i have everything in readiness for you that's very good of you  i    i didn't expect anything - i think we'd like some tea, frith  - ready in the library, sir come along, darling oh, maxim, come in oh - good evening, mrs  danvers  - good evening, madam - i hope alice was satisfactory, madam  - oh, yes, thank you, perfectly she's the parlor maid she'll have to look after you until your own maid arrives oh, but i haven't a maid  i'm sure alice will do very nicely i'm afraid that would not do for very long, madam it's usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid i hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms, madam?oh, i didn't know it had been changed i hope you haven't been to too much trouble i only followed out mr  de winter's instructions well, what did it look like before?it had an old paper and different hangings it was never used much except for occasional visitors oh  then it wasn't mr  de winter's room originally?no, madam  he's never used the east wing before of course, there's no view of the sea from here the only good view of the sea is from the west wing the room's very charming, and i'm sure i'll be comfortable if there's anything you want done, madam, you have only to tell me i suppose you've been at manderley for many years, longer than anyone else not so long as frith he was here when the old gentleman was living,when mr  de winter was a boy oh, i see  and you didn't come till after that?i came here when the first mrs  de winter was a bride mrs  danvers, i do hope we'll be friends you must be patient with me this sort of life is new to me and i do want to make a success of it,and make mr  de winter happy,so i know i can leave all the household arrangements to you very well  i hope i shall do everything to your satisfaction, madam i've managed the house since mrs  de winter's deathand mr  de winter has never complained i think i'll go downstairs now that room in the west wing i was telling you about is there, through that door it's not used now it's the most beautiful room in the house,the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea it was mrs  de winter's room - good morning  - good morning - you're mrs  de winter, aren't you? - yes my name's crawley  i manage the estate for maxim awfully glad to meet you a fearful lot of stuff piled up while maxim was away yes, i'm sure there must have been  i do wish i could help with some of it no, no! frank never allows anybody to help him he's like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes come on, frank, we must go over these estimates i'll get my papers you'll find quantities of breakfast over there but you must eat it all, or cook will be mortally offended i'll do my best, maxim i have to go over the place with frank,just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it you'll be all right, won't you? getting acquainted with your new home?have a look at the times  there's a thrilling articleon what's the matter with english cricket oh, yes   my sister, beatrice, and her husband, giles lacy,have invited themselves over for lunch - today? - yes i suppose the old girl can't wait to look you over you'll find her very direct if she doesn't like you, she'll probably tell you so to your face don't worry, darling, i'll be back in time to protect you from her - goodbye, darling  - goodbye, maxim - goodbye  - goodbye - good morning, madam  - good morning, frith isn't there anything i could get for you, madam?no, thank you, frith  i'm really not very hungry thank you - the paper, madam  - oh, yes  thank you, frith i slipped thank you, frith - it's big, isn't it? - yes, madam, manderley is a big place this was the banquet hall in the old days it's still used on great occasions, such as a big dinner or a ball and the public is admitted here, you know, once a week that's nice i beg pardon, madam i'm afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon but you'll find one in the morning room of course, if you wish this fire lit now, madam   no, frith, i wouldn't dream of it mrs  de winter   i mean, the late mrs  de winteralways did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room,after breakfast thank you, frith is anything wrong, madam?oh, no  which way is the morning room?oh, it's that door there, on the left oh, yes, thank you mrs  de winter? oh, i'm afraid you've made a mistake mrs  de winter's been dead for over a year oh, i mean   oh that was the house telephone, madam probably the head gardener wishing instructions did you want to see me, mrs  danvers?mr  de winter informed me that his sister, mrs  lacy, and major lacyare expected for luncheon i'd like to know if you approve of the menu oh, well, i'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed you will notice, madam, that i've left a blank space for the sauce mrs  de winter was most particular about sauces let's have whatever you think that mrs  de winter would have ordered thank you, madam when you've finished your letters, robert will take them to the post my    my letters?oh, yes, of course  thank you, mrs  danvers how are you, frith? - good morning, mrs  lacy where's mr  de winter?i believe he went down to the farm with mr  crawley how tiresome of him not to be here when we arrive, and how typical i must say old danvers keeps the house looking lovely she's certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from rebecca i wonder how she likes it now,being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl now, where on earth did you get the ideashe's an ex-chorus girl?he picked her up in the south of france, didn't he?what if he did?well, i mean to say, there you are how do you do? i'm maxim's wife how do you do?well, i must say you're quite different from what i expected don't be so silly  she's exactly what i told you she'd be well, how do you like manderley?it's very beautiful, isn't it?and how do you get along with mrs  danvers?well, i   i've never met anyone quite like her before you mean, she scares you she's not exactly an oil painting, is she?giles, you're very much in the way here  go somewhere else well, i'll try and find maxim, shall i?giles i didn't mean to say anything against mrs  danvers oh, there's no need for you to be frightened of her,but i shouldn't have any more to do with her than you can help - shall we sit down? - yes  yes, please you see, she's bound to be insanely jealous at firstand she must resent you bitterly but why should she?don't you know?i should have thought maxim would have told you she simply adored rebecca - how are you, robert? - quite well, thank you, madam - still having trouble with your teeth? - unfortunately, yes, madam you must have them out, all of them - wretched nuisances, teeth  - thank you, madam what a plateful do you hunt?no, i don't  i'm afraid i don't even ride you have to ride down here, we all do which do you ride, sidesaddle or astride?well, of course, i forgot  you don't, do you?you must  nothing else to do around here maxim, when are you going to have parties here again, like the old days?i haven't thought about it - but everyone's dying to see you and    - yes, i bet they are why don't you have the masquerade ball again this summer?my dear, are you fond of dancing?i love it, but i'm not very good at it do you rumba?- never tried  - you must teach me actually, i'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do she sketches a little sketches not this modern stuff, i hope, you know, portrait of a lampshade upside downto represent a soul in torment don't sail, do you?no, i don't thank goodness for that huh?you're very much in love with maxim, aren't you?yes, i can see you are don't mind my saying so, but why don't you do something about your hair?why don't you have it cut or sweep it back behind your ears?oh, no, that's worse what does maxim say about it? does he like it like that?well, he never mentions it oh, well, don't go by me i can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look but i wonder maxim hasn't been at you  he's so particular about clothes i don't think he ever notices what i wear oh  he must have changed a lot, then you mustn't worry about old maxim and his moods one never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his often, he gets into a terrible rage, and when he does   i don't suppose he'll lose his temper with you you seem such a placid little thing come on, old girl  we've got to go on the first tee at 3:00 all right, i'm coming well, goodbye, maxim, old boy goodbye, giles  thanks for coming, old boy goodbye, my dear  forgive me for asking you so many rude questions we both really hope you'll be very happy thank you, beatrice, thank you very much and i must congratulate you upon the way maxim looks we were very worried about him this time last year but then, of course, you know the whole story goodbye, beatrice  - goodbye, old boy - goodbye  - goodbye well, thank heavens they've gone now we can have a walk about the place looks as though we might have a shower  but you won't mind that, will you?no, but wait a minute  i'll go upstairs and get a coat there's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room  robert?run and get a coat from the flower room for mrs  de winter, will you?what do you think of beatrice?oh, i liked her very much, but she kept sayingthat i was quite different from what she expected what the devil did she expect?oh, someone smarter and more sophisticated, i'm afraid do you like my hair?your hair? yes, of course i do  what's the matter with it?oh, i don't know  i just wondered how funny you are thank you - do i have to put it on? - yes, certainly, certainly, certainly you can't be too careful with children come on, jasper  come and take some of that fat off jasper! here  not that way! come here!where does that lead to?oh, it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat oh, let's go down there well, no  it's a perfectly dull, uninteresting stretch of sand,- just like any other  - oh, please well, all right  we'll walk down and take a look if you really want to that's jasper  there must be something wrong - perhaps he's hurt himself  - no, he's all right, leave him alone don't you think i'd better go and see?don't bother about him, i tell you, he can't come to any harm he'll find his own way back!jasper! jasper?oh, there you are what do you want in there, jasper? come on  come on home  let's go home jasper   oh i didn't know that there was anybody   i know that dog he comes from the house he ain't yours no  he's mr  de winter's dog have you anything i could tie him with?come on, jasper you won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?don't you belong on the estate?i weren't doing nothing i was just putting me shells away she's gone in the sea, ain't she?she'll never come back no more no  she'll never come back come on, jasper maxim! what's the matter?maxim!i'm sorry i was such a time, but i had to find a rope for jasper hurry up, jasper, for heaven's sake please wait for me  maxim, what is it? you look so angry you knew i didn't want you to go there, but you deliberately went why not? there was only a cottage down there and a strange man who   - you didn't go in the cottage, did you? - yes, the door was   - don't go there again, do you hear? - well, why not?because i hate the place  and if you had my memories,you wouldn't go there or talk about it or even think about it what's the matter? oh, i'm sorry, please we should have stayed away we should never have come back to manderley oh, what a fool i was i've made you unhappy  somehow, i've hurt you oh, i can't bear to see you like thisbecause i love you so much do you?i've made you cry forgive me i sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all don't i?come, we'll go home and have some tea and forget all about it yes, let's forget all about it here, let me have jasper - hello  come in  - oh, please don't get up, mr  crawley i was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day- about showing me the run of things  - of course i did what are you doing now?notifying all the tenantsthat in celebration of maxim's return with his bride,this week's rent will be free oh, is that maxim's idea?oh, yes, all the servants get an extra week's wages, too oh, he didn't tell me can't i help you? i could at least lick the stamps well, that's terribly nice of you  won't you sit down?yes, thank you i was down at the cottage on the beach the other day there was a man there, a queer sort of person jasper kept barking at him oh, yes, it must have been ben excuse me  he's quite harmless we give him odd jobs now and then that cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin why isn't something done about it?i think if maxim wanted anything done about it, he'd tell me are those all rebecca's things down there?yes yes, they are what did she use the cottage for?the boat used to be moored near there what boat? what happened to it?was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?yes  it capsized and sank  she was washed overboard wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone?she wasn't afraid of anything where did they find her?near edgecombe,about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards maxim went up to identify her it was horrible for him yes, it must have been mr  crawley, please don't think me morbidly curious  it isn't that  it's   it's just that i feel at such a disadvantage all the time, whenever i meet anyone, maxim's sister or even the servants,i know they're all thinking the same thing,that they're all comparing me with her, with rebecca you mustn't think that i can't tell you how glad i am that you married maxim it's going to make all the difference to his life from my point of view, it's very refreshingto find someone like yourself,who's not entirely in tune, shall we say, with manderley that's very sweet of you i daresay i've been stupid,but every day i realize the things she had that i lack beauty and wit and intelligence,and all the things that are so important in a woman you have qualities that are just as important,more important, if i may say so kindliness and sincerity,and if you'll forgive me, modesty,mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world we, none of us want to live in the past,maxim least of all it's up to you, you know, to lead us away from it right i promise you i won't bring this up again,but before we end this conversation,would you answer just one more question?if it's something i'm able to answer, i'll do my best tell me, what was rebecca really like?i suppose   i suppose she was the most beautiful creature i ever saw good evening, maxim hello  the films of the honeymoon have arrived at last do we have time, do you think, before dinner?what on earth have you done to yourself?oh, nothing  i just ordered a new dress from london i hope you don't mind oh, no, no  only, do you think that sort of thing's right for you?- it doesn't seem your type at all  - i thought you'd like it and what have you done to your hair?oh, i see dear, oh, dear  i'm sorry you look lovely, lovely it's very nice, for a change - shall we see these pictures? - yes  i'd love to see them look now, look at that wasn't it wonderful, darling?https://t me/rickychannelcan't we go back there someday?yes, of course  of course  look at you won't our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were?oh, look at you oh, i like that look at that yes, very nice - remember that? yes i wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever, maxim dash it, look hang it i've threaded it up wrong as usual or something yes, frith  what is it?excuse me, sir  may i have a word with you?yes  come in it's about robert, sir there's been a slight unpleasantness between him and mrs  danvers oh, dear - robert is very upset  - this is trouble what is it?it appears that mrs  danvers has accused robert of stealing a valuable ornamentfrom the morning room robert denies the accusation most emphatically, sir - what was the thing, anyway? - china cupid, sir oh, dear  that's one of our treasures, isn't it?well, tell mrs  danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow - tell her i'm sure it wasn't robert  - very good, sir why do they come to me with these things? that's your job, sweetheart maxim, i wanted to tell you, but i forgot the fact is, i broke the china cupid you broke it?now, why on earth didn't you say something about it when frith was here?i don't know  i didn't like to i was afraid he'd think me a fool he'll think you much more of a fool now you'll have to explain to him and mrs  danvers oh, no, maxim  you do it  i'll go upstairs don't be such a little idiot, darling anybody would think you were afraid of them it's all a mistake, mrs  danvers apparently, mrs  de winter broke the cupid herselfand forgot to say anything about it i'm so sorry  i never thought that i'd get robert into trouble is it possible to repair the ornament, madam?no, i'm afraid it isn't  it smashed into pieces what did you do with the pieces?well, i put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk well, it looks as though mrs  de winter was afraidyou were going to put her in prison, doesn't it, mrs  danvers?well, never mind  do what you can to find the pieces see if they can be mended, and above all, tell robert to dry his tears i shall apologize to robert, of course  perhaps if such a thing happens again,mrs  de winter will tell me personally yes, yes, all right  thank you, mrs  danvers well, i suppose that clip will hold all right  i don't know i'm awfully sorry, darling  it was very careless of me - mrs  danvers must be furious with me  - hang mrs  danvers why on earth should you be frightened of her?you behave more like an upstairs maid or something,- not the mistress of the house at all  - yes, i know i do but i feel so uncomfortable i try my best every day, but it's very difficult with people looking meup and down as if i were a prize cow what does it matter if they do? you must rememberthat life at manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here what a slap in the eye i must have been to them, then i suppose that's why you married me,because you knew i was dull and gauche and inexperienced,and there'd never be any gossip about me gossip? what do you mean?i don't know  i just said it for something to say don't look at me like that  maxim what's the matter? what have i said?wasn't a very attractive thing to say, was it?no  it was rude, hateful i wonder if i did a very selfish thing in marrying you how do you mean?i'm not much of a companion to you, am i?you don't get much fun, do you?you ought to have married a boy, someone of your own age maxim, why do you say this? of course we're companions are we? i don't know - i'm very difficult to live with  - no, you're not difficult you're easy, very easy our marriage is a success, isn't it, a great success?we're happy, aren't we? terribly happy?if you don't think we are happy,it would be much better if you didn't pretend i'll go away why don't you answer me?how can i answer youwhen i don't know the answer myself?if you say we're happy, let's leave it at that happiness is something i know nothing about oh, look  there's the one when i left the camerarunning on the tripod, remember?pardon me, madam  is there anything i can do for you?i'm all right, hilda  thank you very much i'll bring the sandwiches immediately, madam - hilda  - yes, madam?the west wing  nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?no, madam  not since the death of mrs  de winter come along, mr  jack, or someone may see you well, danny, old harpy, it's been good to see you again i've been simply breathless to pick up all the news i really don't think it's wise for you to come here, mr  jack jasper, come here oh, nonsense, nonsense  it's just like coming back home quiet, mr  jack yes  we must be careful not to shock cinderella, mustn't we?she's in the morning room if you leave through the garden door, she won't see you i must say, i feel a little like the poor relation,sneaking around through back doors well, toodle-oo, danny goodbye, mr  jack, and please be careful jasper, be quiet looking for me?- i didn't make you jump, did i? - no of course not  i didn't quite know who it was

his little bride all alone it's too bad isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?danny, all your precautions were in vain the mistress of the house was hiding behind the door oh  what about presenting me to the bride?this is mr  favell, madam how do you do?- won't you have some tea or something? - now, isn't that a charming invitation?i've been asked to tea, danny, and i've a good mind to accept oh, well, perhaps you're right  pity, just when we were getting on so nicely we mustn't lead the young bride astray, must we, jasper?goodbye  it's been fun meeting you oh, and by the way, it would be very decent of you if you didn't mentionthis little visit to your revered husband he doesn't exactly approve of me - very well  - that's very sporting of you i wish i had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home i'm just a lonely old bachelor fare thee well oh, and i know what was wrong with that introduction danny didn't tell you, did she?i am rebecca's favorite cousin toodle-oo!do you wish anything, madam?i didn't expect to see you, mrs  danvers i noticed that a window wasn't closed and i came up to see- if i could fasten it  - why did you say that?i closed it before i left the room  you opened it yourself, didn't you?you've always wanted to see this room, haven't you, madam?why did you never ask me to show it to you?i was ready to show it to you every day it's a lovely room, isn't it?loveliest room you've ever seen everything is kept just as mrs  de winter liked it nothing has been altered since that last night come  i'll show you her dressing room this is where i keep all her clothes you would like to see them, wouldn't you?feel this it was a christmas present from mr  de winter he was always giving her expensive gifts, the whole year round i keep her underwear on this side they were made specially for her by the nuns in the convent of st  claire i always used to wait up for her, no matter how late sometimes she and mr  de winter didn't come home until dawn while she was undressing, she'd tell me about the party she'd been to she knew everyone that mattered everyone loved her when she finished her bath,she'd go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you? there  that's better just as she always laid it down \"come on, danny  hair drill, \" she would say and i'd stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time and then she would say, \"good night, danny, \"and step into her bed i embroidered this case for her myself, and i keep it here always did you ever see anything so delicate?look  you can see my hand through it you wouldn't think she'd been gone so long, would you?sometimes when i walk along the corridor,i fancy i hear her just behind me that quick light step  i couldn't mistake it anywhere not only in this room, it's in all the rooms in the house i can almost hear it now do you think the dead come back and watch the living?no, i don't believe it sometimes i wonder if she doesn't come back here to manderley,and watch you and mr  de winter together you look tired why don't you stay here a while and rest?and listen to the sea so soothing listen to it listen listen to the sea tell mrs  danvers i wish to see her immediately you sent for me, madam?yes, mrs  danvers i want you to get rid of all these things - these are mrs  de winter's things  - i am mrs  de winter now very well  i'll give the instructions just a moment, please mrs  danvers, i intend to say nothing to mr  de winterabout mr  favell's visit in fact, i prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon maxim, maxim, you've been gone all day you're choking me well, well, well, what have you been doing with yourself?- i've been thinking  - what did you want to do that for?come in here and i'll tell you darling, could we have a costume ball just as you used to?now what put that into your mind?has beatrice been at you?no, no, but i feel that we ought to do somethingto make people feel that manderley is just the same as it always was oh, please, darling, could we?you don't know what it would mean, you know you'd have to be hostess to hundreds of people, all the county and a lot of young people would come up from london,- and turn the house into a nightclub  - oh, yes  but i want to  please i've never been to a large party, but i could learn what to do and i promise you, you wouldn't be ashamed of me all right, if you think you'd enjoy it you'd better get mrs  danvers to help you out, won't you?no, no  i don't need mrs  danvers to help me  i can do it myself all right, my sweet thank you, darling  thank you - what'll you go as? - i never dress up that's the one privilege i claim as the host what will you be? alice in wonderland, with that ribbon around your hair?no, i won't tell you i'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life come in robert found these sketches in the library, madam - did you intend throwing them away? - yes, mrs  danvers, i did they were just some ideas i was sketching for my costume for the ball hasn't mr  de winter suggested anything?no, i want to surprise him  i don't want him to know anything about it i merely thought that you might find a costumeamong the family portraits that would suit you oh, you mean those at the top of the stairs? i'll go and look at them this one, for instance  might have been designed for you i'm sure you could have it copied i've heard mr  de winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings it's lady caroline de winter, one of his ancestors oh, well, that's a splendid idea, mrs  danvers  i'm very grateful - everything under control, frith? - yes, sir, thank you excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?oh, no  this is just my old cap and gown it certainly makes a very nice costume, sir  and economical, too yes  that was the idea good evening, robert  not very good weather for the ball - no, sir  - very misty on the way and very chilly oh, this wig's so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it hello  what's the idea? adam and eve?oh, maxim, don't be disgusting - strongman  where's my weight thing?

good evening, mr  de winter what the devil do you think you're doing?rebecca but it's the picture  the one in the gallery - what is it? what have i done? - go and take it off it doesn't matter what you put on  anything will do what are you standing there for? didn't you hear what i said?sir george and lady moore dudley tennant  admiral and lady burbank i watched you go down, just as i watched her a year ago even in the same dress, you couldn't compare you knew it you knew that she wore it, and yet you deliberately suggested i wear it why do you hate me? what have i done to you that you should ever hate me so?you tried to take her place, you let him marry you i've seen his face, his eyes they're the same as those first weeks after she died i used to listen to him walking up and down, up and down,all night long, night after night,thinking of her, suffering torture because he'd lost her i don't want to know  i don't want to know!you thought you could be mrs  de winter, live in her house, walk in her steps,take the things that were hers  but she's too strong for you you can't fight her  no one ever got the better of her  never  never she was beaten in the end, but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman it was the sea oh, stop it  stop it  oh, stop it you're overwrought, madam  i've opened a window for you a little air will do you good why don't you go? why don't you leave manderley?he doesn't need you  he's got his memories he doesn't love you  he wants to be alone again with her you've nothing to stay for you've nothing to live for, really, have you?look down there  it's easy, isn't it?why don't you? why don't you?go on don't be afraid shipwreck  ship on the rocks!- a ship aground, sending up rockets! - shipwreck!come on, everybody, down to the bay notify the coast guard  she's aground maxim! maxim!ship ashore  come on! come on, everybody come on! come on! - maxim! maxim!oh!ben, have you seen mr  de winter anywhere?she won't come back, will she? you said so who, ben? what do you mean?the other one - frank, have you seen maxim anywhere? - not since about half an hour ago i thought he'd gone up to the house no, he hasn't been in the house at all,and i'm afraid something might have happened to him frank, what's the matter? is anything wrong?- there is something wrong  - well   the diver who went down to inspect the bottom of the shipcame across the hull of another boat  a little sailboat - frank, is it    - yes it's rebecca's how did they recognize it?he's a local man  knew it instantly it'll be so hard on poor maxim yes  it's going to bring it all back again, and worse than before why did they have to find it?why couldn't they have left it there in peaceat the bottom of the sea?well, i'd better get along and arrange some breakfast for the men all right, frank  i'll go and look for maxim - hello  - maxim you haven't had any sleep - have you forgiven me? - forgiven you?what have i got to forgive you for?for last night  my stupidity about the costume oh, that i'd forgotten  i was angry with you, wasn't i?hmm maxim, can't we start all over again?i don't ask that you should love me  i won't ask impossible things i'll be your friend, your companion  i'll be happy with that you love me very much, don't you?but it's too late, my darling we've lost our little chance of happiness - no, maxim, no  - yes it's all over now the thing's happened the thing i have dreaded day after day - night after night  - maxim, what are you trying to tell me?rebecca has won her shadow has been between us all the time, keeping us from one another she knew that this would happen what are you saying?they sent a diver down - he found another boat  - yes, i know  frank told me rebecca's boat  oh, it's terrible for you  i'm so sorry the diver made another discovery broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin there was a body in there she wasn't alone  there was someone sailing with her,and you have to find out who it was, that's it, isn't it, maxim?you don't understand  there was no one with her it's rebecca's body lying there on the cabin floor oh, no the woman that was washed up at edgecombe,the woman that is now buried in the family crypt,that was not rebecca that was the body of some unknown woman,unclaimed, belonging nowhere i identified it  but i knew it wasn't rebecca it was all a lie i knew where rebecca's body was,lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea how did you know, maxim?because i put it there will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?you see? i was right it's too late no, it's not too late  you're not to say that i love you more than anything in the world - oh, please, maxim, kiss me, please  - no it's no use  it's too late oh, we can't lose each other now  we must be together always no secrets, no shadows we may only have a few days, a few hours maxim, why didn't you tell me before?i nearly did sometimes, but you never seemed close enough how could we be close when i knew you were always thinking of rebecca?how could i even ask you to love me, when i knew you loved rebecca still?what are you talking about?what do you mean?whenever you touched me, i knew you were comparing me with rebecca whenever you looked at me or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,i knew you were thinking, \"this i did with rebecca, and this, and this  \"oh, it's true, isn't it?you thought i loved rebecca? you thought that?i hated her oh, i was carried away by her, enchanted by her as everyone was and when i was married, i was told i was the luckiest man in the world she was so lovely, so accomplished,so amusing \"she's got the three things that really matter in a wife, \" everyone said \"breeding, brains and beauty  \"and i believed them  completely but i never had a moment's happiness with her she was incapable of loveor tendernessor decency you didn't love her  you didn't love her do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in monte carlo?well, i went there with rebecca on our honeymoon that's where i found out about her, four days after we were married she stood there laughing, her black hair blowing in the windand told me all about herself  everything things i'll never tell a living soul i wanted to kill her it would have been so easy  you remember the precipice?i frightened you, didn't i? you thought i was mad perhaps i was  perhaps i am mad it wouldn't make for sanity, would it? living with the devil?\"i'll make a bargain with you, \" she said \"you'd look rather foolish trying to divorce me nowafter four days of marriage,so i'll play the part of a devoted wife,mistress of your precious manderley i'll make it the most famous showplace in england, if you like,and people will visit us and envy us,and say we're the luckiest, happiest couple in the country what a grand joke it'll be  what a triumph  \"i should never have accepted her dirty bargain, but i did i was younger then, and tremendously conscious of the family honor family honor she knew that i'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce courtand give her away, admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud you despise me, don't you?as i despise myself you can't understand what my feelings were,can you?of course i can, darling  of course i can well, i kept the bargain and so did she, apparently oh, she played the game brilliantly,but after a while, she began to grow careless she took a flat in london, and she'd stay away for days at a time then she started to bring her friends down here i warned her, but she shrugged her shoulders \"what's it got to do with you?\" she said she even started on frank poor, faithful frank then there was a cousin of hers, a man named favell yes  i know him  he came the day you went to london why didn't you tell me?i didn't like to i thought it would remind you of rebecca remind me?as if i needed reminding favell used to visit her here in this cottage i found out about it, and i warned her that if he came here again,i'd shoot them both one night, when i found she had come back quietly from london,i thought that favell was with her,and i knew then that i couldn't standthis life of filth and deceit any longer i decided to come down here and have it out with both of them but she was alone she was expecting favell, but he hadn't come she was lying on the divan, a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her she looked ill, queer suddenly, she got up, started to walk toward me \"when i have a child, \" she said, \"neither you nor anyone elsecould ever prove it wasn't yours you would like to have an heir, wouldn't you, max,for your precious manderley?\"then she started to laugh \"how funny  how supremely, wonderfully funny i'll be the perfect mother, just as i've been the perfect wife no one will ever know it ought to give you the thrill of your life, max,to watch my son grow bigger day by dayand to know that when you die, manderley will be his  \"she was face to face with me one hand in her pocket, the other holding a cigarette she was smiling \"well, max?what are you going to do about it?aren't you going to kill me?\"i suppose i went mad for a moment i must have struck her she stood staring at me she looked almost triumphant then she started toward me again  smiling suddenly, she stumbled and fell when i looked down,ages afterwards, it seemed, she was lying on the floor she had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship's tackle i remember wondering why she was still smiling then i realized she was dead but you didn't kill her  it was an accident who would believe me?i lost my head i just knew i had to do something  anything i carried her out to the boat it was very dark  there was no moon i put her in the cabin when the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore, i took a spike,and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull i had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast i climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away i saw the boat heel overand sink i pulled back into the cove it started raining - maxim, does anyone else know of this? - no  no one except you and me we must explain it it's got to be the body of someone you've never seen before no, they're bound to know her  her rings, bracelets she always wore they'll identify her body, then they'll remember the other woman the other woman buried in the crypt if they find out it was rebecca,you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body that the day you went to edgecombe, you were ill,you didn't know what you were doing rebecca's dead  that's what we've got to remember  rebecca's dead she can't speak  she can't bear witness  she can't harm you anymore we're the only two people in the world that know, maxim, you and i i'd told you once that i'd done a selfish thing in marrying you you can understand now what i meant i've loved you, my darling i shall always love you,but i've known all alongthat rebecca would win in the end no, no  she hasn't won no matter what happens now, she hasn't won hello?hello, frank hello, frank  yes who? colonel julyan?yes  tell him i'll meet him there as soon as i possibly can what?well   say we could talk about that when we're sure about the matter what's happened?colonel julyan called he's the chief constable of the county he's been asked by the police to go to the mortuary he wanted to know if i could possibly have made a mistakeabout that other body well, colonel julyan, apparently i did make a mistake about that other body the mistake was natural under the circumstances - besides, you weren't well at the time  - that's nonsense  i was perfectly well don't let it worry you, maxim  nobody can blame you for making a mistake the pity is, you've got to go through the same thing all over again what do you mean?there'll have to be another inquest, of course  same formality and red tape wish you could be spared the publicity of it, but i'm afraid that's impossible oh, yes, publicity i suppose mrs  de winter went below for something and a squall hit the boatwith nobody at the helm i imagine that's about the solution now, don't you think so, crawley?oh, yes  probably the door jammed, and she couldn't get on deck again yeah tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion why, what would he know about it?well, he's examining the boat now  purely as a matter of routine, you know i'll be at the inquest tomorrow, maxim, quite unofficially, you know we must get together for a game of golf when it's all over, eh?bye-bye i have the evening papers, madam  would you care to see them?oh, no thank you, frith,and i prefer that mr  de winter weren't troubled with them, either i understand, madam  permit me to say that we're all most distressed outside thank you, frith i'm afraid the news has been a great shock to mrs  danvers yes, i rather expected it would be it seems there's to be a coroner's inquest, madam?yes, frith  it's purely a formality of course, madam  i   i wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give evidence,i should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family oh, thank you, frith, why, i   i'm sure mr  de winter will be very happy to hear it but i don't think anything will be necessary maxim hello, darling oh, maxim, i'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow what do you mean?you won't lose your temper, will you?promise me that they won't make you angry all right, darling  i promise no matter what he asks you, you won't lose your head?don't worry, dear they can't do anything at once, can they?no then we've a little time left to be together yes - i want to go to the inquest with you  - i'd rather you didn't, darling but i can't wait here alone i promise you, i won't be any trouble to you and i must be near you so that no matter what happens,we won't be separated for a moment all right, dear i don't mind this whole thing except for you i can't forget what it's done to you i've been thinking of nothing else since it happened it's gone forever,that funny, young, lost look i loved it won't ever come back i killed that when i told you about rebecca it's gone in a few hours, you've grown so much older oh, maxim, maxim black jack brady was his name the most important arrest i ever made it must have been about two years ago now of course, there was no doubt about it  he was hung a month after i caught him hello  wait a minute they've got old balmy ben up now you remember the late mrs  de winter, don't you?- she's gone  - yes, we know that - she went in the sea  the sea got her  - that's right  that's right now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore- that last night she went sailing  - eh?were you on the shore that last night she went out, when she didn't come back?i didn't see nothing  i don't want to go to the asylum them cruel folks there now, nobody's going to send you to the asylum all we want you to do is tell us what you saw i didn't see nothing come, come did you see mrs  de winter get into her boat that last night?i don't know nothing i don't want to go to the asylum very well  you may go - eh? - you may go now - mr  tabb, step forward, please  - yes?the evidence you give will be the truth, the whole truthand nothing but the truth, so help you god?i do, so help me god the late mrs  de winter used to send her boat- to your shipyard for reconditioning  - that's right, sir can you remember any occasionwhen she had any sort of accident with the boat?no, sir  i often said mrs  de winter was a born sailor now, when mrs  de winter went below, as is supposed,and a sudden gust of wind came down,that would be enough to capsize the boat, wouldn't it?excuse me, sir  but there's a little more to it than that - what do you mean, mr  tabb? - i mean, sir, the seacocks what are the seacocks?sea   the seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat they're always kept tight closed when you're afloat yes?well, yesterday, when i examined that boat, i found they'd been opened what could be the reason for that?just this, that's what flooded the boat and sunk her are you implying that boat never capsized at all?i know it's a terrible thing to say, sir, but in my opinion,she was scuttled - and there's them holes  - what holes?- in her planking  - what are you talking about?of course, that boat's been underwater for over a year,and the tide's been knocking her against the ridge but it seemed to me them holes looked as if she'd made them from the inside then you believe she must have done it deliberately couldn't have been no accident, not with her knowledge of boats you knew the former mrs  de winter very well, i believe?oh, yes would you have believed her capable of suicide?no  frankly, i would not  but you never can tell you may stand down, mr  tabb mr  de winter, please sorry to drag you back for further questioning, mr  de winter but you've heard the statement of mr  tabb i wonder if you can help us in any way i'm afraid not can you think of any reason why there should be holesin the planking of the late mrs  de winter's boat?well, of course i can't think of any reason has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before?well, since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean,i scarcely think that likely mr  de winter, i want you to believe we all feel very deeplyfor you in this matter but you must remember that i don't conduct this inquiryfor my own amusement - that's rather obvious, isn't it? - i hope that it is well, since she went sailing alone,are we to believe that she drove those holes herself?you may believe what you like can you enlighten us as to why mrs  de winter should have wantedto end her own life?i know of no reason whatever mr  de winter, however painful it may be,i have to ask you a very personal question were relations between you and the late mrs  de winter perfectly happy?i won't stand this any longer! you might as well know now   we'll adjourn till after lunch mr  de winter, i presume you'll be available for us then?i told you, you should have had some breakfast you're hungry  that's what's the matter with you mr  frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house,and sent me with it no, that's fine  pull around the corner very good, sir awfully foolish of me, fainting like that nonsense  if you hadn't fainted like that, i'd have really lost my temper darling, please be careful darling, wait here a few moments  i'll see if i can find old frank of course, darling  don't worry about me  i'll be all right sure?here, try a spot of this  do you good thank you - are you all right? - yes, of course - i won't be long  - right you are hello and how does the bride find herself today?i say, marriage with max is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?i think you'd better go before maxim gets back oh, jealous, is he? well, i can't say i blame him but you don't think i'm the big bad wolf, do you?i'm not, you know  i'm a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke and i think you're behaving splendidly over all this  perfectly splendidly you know, you've grown up a bit since i last saw you  it's no wonder   what do you want, favell?oh, hello, max  things are going pretty well for you, aren't they?better than you ever expected i was rather worried about you at first  that's why i came down to the inquest well, i'm touched by your solicitude but if you don't mind, we'd rather like to have our lunch lunch? i say, what a jolly idea  rather like a picnic, isn't it?i'm so sorry  do you mind if i put this there?you know, max, old boy, i really think i ought to talk things over with you talk what things over?well, those holes in the planking, for one thing those holes that were drilled from the inside - oh, mullen? - yes, sir?would you, like a good fellow, have my car filled with petrol?- it's almost empty  - very good, sir - and, mullen, close the door, will you? - yes, sir does this bother you?you know, old boy, i have a strong feeling that before the day's out,somebody's going to make use of that rather expressive,though somewhat old-fashioned term, \"foul play  \"am i boring you with all this?no?good  well, you see, max, i find myself in a rather awkward position you've only got to read this note to understand  it's from rebecca and, what's more, she had the foresight to put a date on it she wrote me the day she died incidentally, i was at a party on that nightso i didn't get it until the next day and what makes you think that note would interest me?oh, i'm not gonna bother you with the contents now but i can assure you that it is not the note of a womanwho intends to drown herself that same night by the way, what do you do with old bones? bury them?however, for the time being   you know, max, i'm getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman i don't know if you've ever experienced the feelingof driving an expensive motorcar which isn't your own?but it can be very, very exasperating you know what i mean  you want to own the car yourself i often wonder what it would be like to retire to the country have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting i've never figured out what it would cost a year,but i'd like to talk about it with you i'd like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work hello, favell  you looking for me, maxim?yes mr  favell and i have a little business transaction on hand i think we had better conduct it over at the inn they may have a private room there well, see you later find colonel julyan  tell him i want to see him immediately come on, favell  let's go - have you a private room, please? - of course, sir  through there, sir hope this will do, mr  de winter splendid  splendid  exactly like the ritz any orders, gents?yes  you might bring me a large brandy and soda how about you, max? have one on me  i feel i can afford to play host thanks  i don't mind if i do make it two, will you, like a good fellow?- very good, sir  where's mr  de winter?through the other door, sir colonel julyan, this is mr  favell oh, i know colonel julyan  we're old friends, aren't we?since you're old friends, i assume you also knowhe's head of the police here he might be interested to hear your proposition  tell him all about it i don't know what you mean  i merely said i hoped to give up selling carsand retire into the country actually, he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquestif i made it worth his while i only want to see justice done, colonel now, that boat builder's evidence suggested certain possible theoriesconcerning rebecca's death  one of them, of course, is suicide now i have a little note here which i considerputs that possibility quite out of court read it, colonel \"jack, darling,i've just seen the doctor and i'm going down to manderley right away i shall be at the cottage all this eveningand shall leave the door open for you i have something terribly important to tell you rebecca  \"now, does that look like the note of a womanwho had made up her mind to kill herself?and apart from that, do you mean to tell methat if you wanted to commit suicide, you would go to all the troubleof putting out to sea in a boat, and then take a hammer and chiseland laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?come, colonel  as an officer of the law,don't you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?- of murder? - what else?you've known max a long time  so you know he's the old-fashioned type,who'd die to defend his honor, or who'd kill for it it's blackmail, pure and simple blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple it can bring a lot of trouble to a great many people and the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of it oh, i see  you're going to hold de winter's hand through all this just because he's the big noise around hereand he's actually permitted you to dine with him be careful, favell  you've brought an accusation of murder - have you any witnesses? - i do have a witness it's that fellow, ben if that stupid coroner hadn't been as much of a snob as you are,he'd have seen that half-wit was hiding something and why should ben do that?because we caught him once, rebecca and i,peering at us through the cottage window rebecca threatened him with the asylum  that's why he was afraid to speak but he was always hanging about  he must have seen this whole thing it's ridiculous, even listening to all this you're like a little trade union, all of you, aren't you?and if my guess is right, crawley,there's a bit of malice in your soul toward me, isn't there?crawley didn't have much success with rebecca,but he ought to have more luck this time and the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm, crawley,in a week or so  every time she faints, in fact - de winter! - maxim, please!that temper of yours will do you in yet, max excuse me, gentlemen - now is there anything else? - yes you might bring mr  de winter a sedative - no, no  nothing at all  just leave us  - very good now, favell, let's get this business over https://t me/rickychannelas you seem to have worked out the whole thing so carefully,perhaps you can provide us also with a motive i knew you were going to bring that up, colonel i've read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive and if you'll all excuse me, i might supply that, too i wish you'd go home  you ought not to be here through all this please let me stay, maxim surely, colonel julyan, you're not going to allow this fellow to   my opinion of favell is no higher than yours, crawley but in my official capacity, i have no alternativebut to pursue his accusations  i entirely agree with you, colonel in matters as serious as this, we must make sure of every pointand explore every avenue and in fact, if i may coin a phrase, leave no stone unturned here she is, the missing link, the witness who will help supply the motive colonel julyan, mrs  danvers  i believe you know everyone else won't you sit down?no offense, colonel, but i think i'll put this to danny she'll understand it more easily danny, who was rebecca's doctor?mrs  de winter always had dr  mcclean from the village now, you heard  i said rebecca's doctor in london i don't know anything about that oh, don't give me that, danny  you knew everything about rebecca you knew she was in love with me, didn't you?surely you haven't forgotten the good times she and i used to havedown at the cottage on the beach she had a right to amuse herself, didn't she?love was a game to her  only a game  it made her laugh, i tell you she used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you can you think of why mrs  de winter should have taken her own life?no, no  i refuse to believe it i knew everything about her and i won't believe it there  you see? it's impossible  she knows that as well as i do now, listen to me, danny we know that rebecca went to a doctor in londonon the last day of her life  who was it?i don't know i understand, danny you think we're asking you to reveal secrets of rebecca's life you're trying to defend her  but that's what i'm doing i'm trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide mrs  danvers, it has been suggestedthat mrs  de winter was deliberately murdered there you have it in a nutshell, danny but there's one more thing you'll want to know, the name of the murderer it's a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily george fortescue maximilian de winter there was a doctor mrs  de winter sometimes went to him privately she used to go to him even before she was married we don't want reminiscences, danny  what was his name?dr  baker  165 goldhawk road, shepherd's bush there you are, colonel  there's where you'll find your motive go and question dr  baker  he'll tell you why rebecca went to him to confirm the fact that she was going to have a child a sweet, curly-headed little child it isn't true  it isn't true  she would have told me she told max about it  max knew he wasn't the father so, like the gentleman of the old school that he is, he killed her i'm afraid we shall have to question this dr  baker hear, hear  but for safety's sake, i think i'd like to go along, too yes  unfortunately, i suppose you have the right to ask that i'll see the coroner and have the inquest postponedpending further evidence i say, aren't you rather afraid that the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?you have my word for it that he will not do that toodle-oo, max  come along, danny let's leave the unhappy couple to spend their last moments together alone are you sure you don't want me to go with you, max?no, darling  it'll be very tiring for you i'll be back the very first thing in the morning - and i won't even stop to sleep  - i'll be waiting for you - ready, maxim? - yes you two go on ahead  i'll follow with favell dr  baker, you may have seenmr  de winter's name in the papers recently yes  yes  in connection with the body that was found in a boat my wife was reading all about it  a very sad case  my condolences this is going to take hours  let me   don't bother, favell  i think i can tell dr  baker we're trying to discover certain factsconcerning the late mrs  de winter's activities on the day of her death october the 12th, last year i want you to tell me if you can,if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?i'm awfully sorry  i'm afraid i can't help you i should have remembered the name de winter i've never attended a mrs  de winter in my life how can you possibly tell all your patients' names?i can look it up in my engagement diary if you like - did you say the 12th of october? yes here we are no  no de winter are you sure?well, here are all the appointments for that day ross, campbell, steadall, perrino, danvers   - danny? what the devil? - would you read that name again?did you say danvers?yes  i have a mrs  danvers for 3:00 what did she look like? can you remember?yes, i remember her quite well  she was a very beautiful woman - tall, dark, exquisitely dressed  rebecca the lady must have used an assumed name is that so?this is a surprise  i've known her a long time what was the matter with her?well, there are certain ethics could you supply a reason, dr  baker, for mrs  de winter's suicide?for her murder, you mean?she was going to have a kid, wasn't she? come on  out with it!tell me, what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?i take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to   i assure you we'd not be troubling you if it were not necessary you want to know if i can suggest any motiveas to why mrs  de winter should have taken her life?yes, i think i can the woman who called herself mrs  danvers was very seriously ill she was not going to have a child?that was what she thought  my diagnosis was different i sent her to a well-known specialist for an examination and x-rays and on this date, she returned to me for his report i remember her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph \"i want to know the truth, \" she said \"i don't want soft words and a bedside manner if i'm for it, you can tell me right away  \"i knew she was not the type to accept a lie she'd asked for the truth, so i let her have it she thanked me  i never saw her again, so i assumed   - what was wrong with her? - cancer yes, the growth was deep-rooted an operation would have been no earthly use at all in a short time, she would have been under morphia there was nothing that could be done for her, except wait did she say anything when you told her?she smiled in a queer sort of way your wife was a wonderful woman, mr  de winter and, oh, yes, i remember she said somethingthat struck me as being very peculiar at the time when i told her it was a matter of months, she said,\"oh, no, doctor, not that long  \"you've been very kind  you've told us all we wanted to know we shall need an official verification - verification? - yes - to confirm the verdict of suicide  i understand can i offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?no, that's very kind  i think we ought to be going thank heaven we know the truth dreadful thing  dreadful young and lovely woman like that  no wonder   i never had the remotest idea  neither did danny, i'm sure i wish i had a drink will we be needed at the inquest any further, colonel julyan?no, no  i can see to it that maxim's not troubled any further - thank you, sir  - you ready to start, colonel?no, thank you  i'm staying in town tonight and let me tell you, favell, blackmail is not much of a profession and we know how to deal with it in our part of the world,strange as it may seem to you i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about but if you ever need a new car, colonel, just let me know it's impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this you know what i feel without my saying it not at all  put the whole thing behind you but let your wife know  she'll be getting worried yes, of course  i'll phone her at onceand we'll get straight down to manderley goodbye, crawley  maxim's got a great friend - frank  - yes, maxim?- there's something you don't know  - oh, no, there isn't i didn't kill her, frank but i know now that when she told me about the child,she wanted me to kill her she lied on purpose  she foresaw the whole thing that's why she stood there laughing when she   don't think about it anymore thank you, frank hello, danny  i just wanted to tell you the news rebecca held out on both of us  she had cancer yes, suicide now max and that dear little bride of hiswill be able to stay on at manderley and live happily ever after bye-bye, danny - this your car, sir? - yes will you be going soon? this isn't a parking place, you know oh, isn't it? well, people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to it's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do when you phoned, did she say she'd wait up?i asked her to go to bed, but she wouldn't hear of it i wish i could get some more speed out of this thing is something worrying you, maxim?i can't get over the feeling something's wrong https://t me/rickychannel- frank  - what's the matter? why did we stop?what's the time?well, this clock's wrong  it must be 3:00 or 4:00  why?that can't be the dawn breaking over there it's in the winter that you see the northern lights, isn't it?that's not the northern lights  that's manderley frith! frith!mrs  de winter  where is she?- i thought i saw her, sir  - where?maxim!thank heavens

apparently it's six {\\an8}- what happened? - not clear  we know they escaped secretary of state's office{\\an8}- where are they? - the canadian ambassador's house - do they stay put? are we attempting rescue? - hold for the secretary of state yes  is white house joining?they claim the embassy was a den of espionage {\\an8}- we wish it was  - a fuckin' den of espionage {\\an8}cl's got three people over there, they don't see a revolution coming?white house, chief of staff's office{\\an8}- call it something other than intelligence  - hold for the chief of staff - hodding  - i'll call him back they're sticking  no release till we expel the shah - put him on a plane, then  fuck him  - he's half-dead and he's in chemo we took him in  he's ours now great, so we'll take in any prick as long as he's got cancer?no, just the pricks on our side so all our other pricks on their prick thrones know when they get thrown out on a rail      they won't get their fucking spleens taken out by some camel vet in sinai what about the six who are with the canadians?we've got 60 in the embassy with guns to their heads right now the whole world is watching the embassy  they're safer than the six on the street banisadr's saying it'll be over in 24 hours we leave the six where they are  i'll go brief the president all right, let's get to it so far official comments about the incident have been a model of restraint 69 days lateriran's revolutionary guard has rounded up a gang of terrorists      blamed for one murder of a half-dozen followers of ayatollah khomeini it says security at khomeini's home now has been tightened this, by the way, is the 69th day that the american hostages have been held in tehran there is no change reported in the hostage situation in this country, george meany died last night  he was 85 years old yeah yes what?wallace to begin with, of course      we wanted to learn about the hostages held in the american embassy compound they may not understand what their ordeal means to their countrymen but this nation, their nation, is outraged {\\an8}and we cannot really know what it is like inside the prison that was once our embassy c i a  headquarters, virginiaactions of iran have shocked the civilized world our embassy has been seized      and more than 60 american citizens continue to be held as hostages the situation in iran this morning is unchanged in regard to the hostages nbc's situation in iran has changed, however - is he back there? - office what happened?the six of them went out a back exit brits turned them away, kiwis turned them away canadians took them in traffic calls them \"the houseguests \"they haven't left the canadian ambassador's house since it happened - why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago? - too dangerous you got revolutionary guards going door-to-door like jehovah's witnesses half of them think that khomeini's been too lenient on the ones in the embassy what about the white house?carter's shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids the canadians are done they say they're bearing too much risk  their foreign secretary corners vance in brussels       and told him she wants the six of them out - who else knows? - just the families meanwhile, some genius in our embassy was keeping a mug book    -    on everybody who worked there  - jesus christ we think it got shredded before they got in but now the bastards are using sweatshop kids to reassemble the shreds and once they reassemble that book they'll know six americans got out and they'll know what they look like standing room only for beheadings in the square - who's handling? - state is coordinating in-house state?- they don't do exfils  - they do now they want to run it by us, strictly as consultants engell says it's a lose-lose these people die, they die badly  publicly state wants the blame, we'll give it to them what does he want me here for?so he can tell state he ran it by his best exfil guy okay this is bob pender from state o s he's been talking to morgan at extaff - bob? - thank you {\\an8}all right {\\an8}mark and cora lijek twenty-nine and 25  he's a consular officer, she's an assistant newlyweds  they only just got there a couple months ago no language skills or in-country knowledge {\\an8}henry lee schatz  agricultural attach\u00e3\u00a9 from idaho a bit of an oddball, apparently he was there to sell u s  tractors to iranian agro joe stafford  late 20s he's smart and a climber speaks farsi he arranged the hire of his wife, kathy embassy was understaffed, so the faculty wives were the typing pool and bob anders  senior consular officer      oldest of the group and most likely to be group leader they're in hiding at the canadian ambassador's residence fortunately, we do not believe the iranians are aware the six have escaped so, what we like for this are bicycles we've identified back roads from the shemiran district a couple of rat lines through the mountains       to the crossing near tabriz cars are off the table because of the roadblocks we wait till the weather clears up       then deliver the six bikes, provide them with maps to the turkish border we have intelligence they can ride bicycles or we're prepared to send in somebody to teach them or you could just send in training wheels and meet them at the border with gatorade tony it's 300 miles to the turkish border they'd need a support team following them with a tire pump we were just asked to sharpshoot this state is handling the op i'm sorry, who is this?tony's an exfil spesh  he got a lot of the shah's people out after the fall sir, if these people can read or add       pretty soon they're gonna figure out they're six short of a full deck it's winter  you can't afford to wait around till spring so it's nice enough to take a bike ride the only way out of that city is the airport  build new cover identities for them       you send in a moses, he takes them out on a commercial flight - we've explored those options  - they'll never get past airport control - komiteh own the place  - they could pose as reporters - the government issued 70-something    - seventy-four    visas for american journalists the revolutionary guards keep them on 74 leashes if they're caught with fake journalist creds, it's peter jennings' head in a noose in an hour north american accents gives us limited options so we get the canadians to issue them passports what about english teachers at the international school?it's a good idea, but that school's been closed for eight months okay, so how about the do-gooders?six canadians have been over there inspecting crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat we give them creds, makes them look like ag ngos it's a feed the kids thing  okay?those kids are black those are african kids - we get ethnically appropriate kids  - are there starving kids in iran?i'm sure there's some skinny kids in iran, so     - what about missionaries? - a logo with seeds  call it \"seeds of hope \"hold on sir, do you have this newspaper in front of you? would you mind taking a look at it?what's in this picture?- tehran  - right  what's on the ground?- snow  - right so, what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under frosty?sir, exfils are like abortions you don't wanna need one       but when you do, you don't do it yourself you have a better plan?no, sir reynolds whatever the conflicting signals from iran today      and for that matter, every day      about whether the hostages will or will not be tried as spies      the government of the united states has not deviated from its basic demand:the hostages must be freed --claims to defend human rights, it not only does not defend them       it violates them for all nations {\\an8}we demand extradition   u s  embassy, tehran{\\an8}   of a man who, for more than 37 years, with the united states' support      has killed months-old babies in the arms of their mothers he said if the americans try military force to rescue the hostages      the students will kill them all and blow up the embassy americans were outraged at iran and anyone iranian before that decision was taken, there was a demonstration in houston an iranian flag was burned      when anti-iranian demonstrators gathered near the iranian consulate --also is what led to a decision to scrutinize the visas of iranians    they knew exactly what was going to happen  they knew but i don't understand what they should do now send him back, just to be tortured and killed?i don't think that justice is the worst thing when did people first tell you that torture was going on in iran?they would never come to me and say, \"well, sir, we have tortured this fellow \"president sadat of egypt, he calls you, imam--forgive me, his words, not mine --a lunatic why didn't he have a choice? why do you think he didn't have a choice?he would've been referred to as a barbarian that's why they're saying that their current regime    the shah did more for women's rights--i think you'd better-- please, everyone, get into the crawlspace at one point, the mob cornered one of the iranians when he tried to protect himself, this is what happened just hit him again!we're not gonna take it anymore! we're sick of it!america!even in our little community here, i mean, people are drawn up tight, they're tense they shouldn't even let those students in that embassy there just shoot a couple of them, show them we mean business men who served in vietnam for what they believed was right are angry i'm mad as hell {\\an8}i'm like the guy screaming on that movie program in network, you know? i've had it and if need be, i'll bear arms again and that's the way it is wednesday, january 16th, 1980 the 74th day of captivity for 50 americans in iran - hello? - buddy man i'll get mom i'm looking for you did you do your homework tonight?- yeah, it was easy  - excellent  what are we watching?battle for the planet of the apes tell me, what channel is it on?five all right - what'd you do at school today? - nothing  i don't know  nothing can't be nothing  something must've happened after school i got some baseball cards - mm-hm  - that was fun okay, you know those science-fiction movies?star trek, star wars  they need an exotic location to shoot moonscape, mars, desert, you know now, imagine this:they're a canadian film crew on a location scout for a science-fiction movie we put it out there--the canadian producers put it out there --that we're looking at egypt, istanbul then we go to the consulate and say, \"hey, we wanna look at iran too \"i fly into tehran, we all fly out together as a film crew  done flamboyant cover identities should be avoided, as it increases operational visibility this is more plausible than foreigners who wanna go be teachers in iran you wanna blend in with the population, you don't look like a rodeo clown just gonna wake up tomorrow morning and be in the movie business?we already have credentials for the teachers - no, sir, we have a contact in l a  - chambers john chambers  he's a hollywood prosthetics guy he's got an oscar, he did planet of

this house - i need some fresh air  i can't breathe  - stay inside the fucking house - who saw me go outside? i'm just curious  - that's not the point, bob - it doesn't matter who saw you go out  - did you see me?- no  - i did, okay? i saw you bob, it only takes one second for them to spot you some americans are missing look at the repaired list of embassy employees the numbers don't match finish assembling the pictures from the embassy all i need is their faces and i will find them yes, sir, it will be done we want you to go to l a if you can make the movie thing credible, we'll take

that's who i'm gonna go get  - what am i making?i need you to help me make a fake movie heh  you came to the right place i wanna set up a production company and build a cover around making a movie - that we're not gonna make  - no so you wanna come to hollywood and act like a big shot?- without actually doing anything? - no you'll fit right in let's see well, this one's got an m a  in english  she should be your screenwriter sometimes they go along on scouts because they want the free meals here's your director can you teach somebody to be a director in a day?you can teach a rhesus monkey to be a director in a day look, if you're gonna do this, you gotta do it the kho-maniacs are froot loops, but they got cousins      who sell prayer rugs and eight-tracks on la brea you can't build cover stories around a movie that doesn't exist you need a script  you need a producer - make me a producer  - no you're an associate producer at best if you're gonna do a $20 million star wars rip-off       you need somebody who's a somebody to put their name on it somebody respectable with credits who you can trust with classified information who'll produce a fake movie for free hi  i only got a couple of minutes  i'm getting a lifetime achievement award - mazel tov, lester  - ah i'd rather stay home and count the wrinkles on my dog's balls okay, you got six people hiding out in a town

stay here if we get caught, you and pat go on trial for harboring the enemy, you know that?pat and i have discussed it  it's the risk we took that man out there has got bad cards and he is going to lose and if he loses, it's our lives and his life too look, we don't have any alternatives we gotta go these cover identities were created specifically for each one of you what you need to do is memorize everything that's inside who you are, what you are, where you've been  complete bio and then add to that where do you vacation? what are your allergies? who'd you have an affair with?the only

conversation i became a little too dependent on the whiskey   a little too undependable on the job now, before you say i'm just a sorry drunkard   let me state my case as reliable employment as overseeing is,it is no easy chore on the spirit i say, no man of conscious   can take the lash to another human day in and day out   without shredding at his own self takes him to a place   where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected   or he finds some way to trample his guilty sensations so, i trampled with frequency i gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity but such profitable outcomes are reserved for plantation masters it's the lot of the rest of us to serve now, all i want is to earn a decent wage and get myself home the proceeds of my fiddling performances just a few picayunes, but all i have in the world i promise them to you if you will do me the favor i require but i beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request uh   what is it you ask?first, your word, sir on my honor it's a simple enough request i only ask that you deposit a letterat the post office in marksville   and that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever a patron is what i require, sir i'll do it and i'll accept whatever payment's offered to assist you, i put my own self at risk i will do so   but fair compensation is all i ask draw up your letter we'll meet again in two days?in two days thank you well, boy   i understand i got a learned nigger that writes letters tries to get white fellas to mail them armsby told me today   the devil was among my niggers that i had one that needed watching   or he would run away when i asked him why   he said you come over to him   waked him up in the middle of the night   and wanted him to carry a letter   to marksville what do you got to say to that?there's no truth to it you say how could i write a letter without ink or paper?who am i gonna write to? i got no friends living as i know of that armsby   that armsby is a lying, drunken fellow didn't he want you to hire him as an overseer?well, that's it he wants to make you believe we're all gonna run away   so you'll hire him as an overseer he believes you're a soft soap and he's given to such talk made this story out of whole cloth   because he wants a situation it's all a lie, master it's all a lie i'll be damned were he not free and white, platt were he not free and white <i>sun gonna set here</i><i>under the mountain</i><i>sun gonna set here</i><i>under the mountain</i><i>sun gonna set here</i><i>under the mountain</i>edward!get

work at hand, as requested and as paid for if something rubs you wrongly   i offer you the opportunity to speak on it you ask plainly, so i will tell you plainly what amused me just then was your concern for my well-being in this heat   when, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers   \"the condition of my laborers\"?it is horrid  it's all wrong all wrong, mr  epps they ain't hired help they're my property you say that with pride i say it as fact if this conversation concerns what is factualand what is not, then it must be said   that there is no justice nor righteousness in their slavery but you do open up an interesting question what right have you to your niggers,when you come down to the point?what right? mmm i bought them  i paid for them of course you did, and the law saysyou have the right to hold a nigger but begging the law's pardon, it lies suppose they pass a law taking awayyour liberty, making you a slave suppose that ain't a supposable case laws change, epps universal truths are constant it is a fact, a plain and simple fact   that what is true and right is true and right for all white and black alike you comparing me to a nigger, bass?i'm only asking, in the eyes of god, what is the difference?you might as well ask what the difference isbetween a white man and a baboon i seen one of them critters in orleans know just as much as any nigger i got listen, epps these niggers are human beings if they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals   you and men like you will have to answer for it there is an ill, mr  epps   a fearful ill resting upon this nation and there will be a day of reckoning yet you like to hear yourself talk, bass   better than any man i know of you'd argue that black was white, or white, black   if anybody would contradict you a fine supposition if you lived among yankees in new england but you don't you most assuredly do not i knew it, i knew it, i knew it!patsey!pats!where is she?where's pats?where is she, damn it? where is she?phebs, where is she? where is patsey? where is she?what you standing there for?we know nothing of her, master know nothing of what? we know nothing of   of what? where has

with the lord bring the lord into your deceptions?you're coming from shaw's plantation no! master epps now, you speak?now that you want to add to her lies, you find your tongue!i went to master shaw's plantation ah! you admit it yes, freely and you know why?i got this from mistress shaw mistress epps won't even grant me no soap to clean with i stink so much, i make myself gag!500 pounds of cotton

covetousness!i don't lie, master if you kill me, i'll stick to that i'll fetch you down i'll learn you to go to shaw's treach run and fetch some line edward!strip her  strike her bare and lash her to the post you done this to yourself, pats do it strike the life from her beat her give her the whip! give it all to her!platt, you come here and you beat her now platt!come here!i'd rather it you,

whip!get up!thou devil!sooner or later   somewhere in the course of eternaljustice, thou shalt answer for this sin!sin? there is no sin man does how he pleases with his property at the moment, platt, i'm of great pleasure you be goddamn careful i don't want tocome and lighten my mood no further master bass i want to ask you what part of the country you come from no part of this land i originate from canada now, guess where that is i know where canada is i've been there myself montreal   and kingston and queenston and a great many places well-traveled for a slave how came you here?master bass   if justice had been done, i never would have been here how's this?tell me all i'm afraid to tell you every word you speak is a profound secret your story   it is amazing and in no good way do you believe, sir, in justice, as you said?i do that slavery is an evil that should befall none?i believe so if you truly do   then i ask, i beg   that you write my friends in the north   acquainting them of my situation   and beseeching them to forward free papers it would be   an unspeakable happiness   to see my wife   and my family again i traveled this country for the best part of 20 years   and my freedom is everything the fact that i can walk out of here tomorrow brings me great pleasure my life doesn't mean much to anyone it seems yours might mean a lot to a whole lot of people but what you ask of me, sir, scares me and i must say, i am afraid not just for you, but for me i will write your letter, sir and if it brings you your freedom,it will be more than a pleasure it will have been my duty now, would you kindly hand me those shingles?platt!where's the boy called platt?come here, boy your name is platt, is it?yes, sir you know that man?mr  parker say again?mr  parker that man

godfather to the italian people that's a very sacred, close relationship i respect it  tell him to ask me anything else this favor i can't give him he never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first you don't understand  johnny fontane never gets that movie that part is perfect for him  it'll make him a big star i'm going to run him out of the business, and let me tell you why johnny fontane ruined one of woltz international's most valuable prot\u00e3\u00a9g\u00e3\u00a9s we trained her for five years  singing, acting, dancing lessons i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her, to make her a big star let me be even more frank to show you that i'm not a hard-hearted man that it's not all dollars and cents she was beautiful  she was young and innocent!she's the greatest piece of ass i've had and i've had them all over the world then johnny fontane comes along with his olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off she threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous!and a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!you get the hell out of here!if that goombah tries any rough stuff, tell him i'm no bandleader yeah, i heard that story thank you for dinner and a very pleasant evening maybe your car can take me to the airport mr  corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately - you're not too tired, are you, tom? - no, i slept on the plane i have the sollozzo notes here now   sollozzo is known as the turk he's supposed to be very good with a knife,but only in matters of business with reasonable complaint his business is narcotics he has fields in turkey, where they grow poppy in sicily he has plants to process them into heroin he needs cash, he needs protection from the police he'll give a piece of the action  i don't know how much the tattaglia family is behind him here  they have to be in it for something - what about his prison record? - one term in italy, one here he's known as a top narcotics man - santino, what do you think? - a lot of money in that white powder tom?yes  there's more money in narcotics than anything else if we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe the five families with that money they can buy more police and political power then they come after us now we have unions and gambling, and that's great, but narcotics is the future if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything in 10 years' time so? what's your answer going to be, pop?don corleone i need a man who has powerful friends i need a million dollars in cash i need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like nickels and dimes - what is the interest for my family? - 30% in the first year your end should be three, four million dollars and then it would go up and what is the interest for the tattaglia family?my compliments i'll take care of them, out of my share so i receive 30% for finance,political influence and legal protection?that's right why do you come to me? why do i deserve this generosity?if you consider a million dollars in cash just finance,te salud don corleone i said that i would see you, because i heard you were a serious man,to be treated with respect but, i must say no to you and i'll give you my reason it's true, i have a lot of friends in politics they wouldn't be friendly long if i was involved in drugs instead of gambling,which they regard as a harmless vice, but drugs is a dirty business it doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living but your business is    a little dangerous if you're worried about security, the tattaglias will guarantee it - the tattaglias would guarantee our    - wait a minute i have a sentimental weakness for my children, and i spoil them they talk when they should listen  but anyway   signor sollozzo, my no is final  i wish to congratulate you on your new business i know you'll do well, and good luck especially since your interests don't conflict with mine  thank you santino come here what's the matter with you?your brain is going soft from playing with that girl never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again go on tom, what's this nonsense?it's from johnny  he's starring in that new film - take it away  - take it over there andtell luca brasi to come in i'm a little worried about this sollozzo fellow find out what he's got under his fingernails go to the tattaglias make

be released with our proposition listen to what he has to say before you do anything what's done is done  don't lose that famous temper of yours, sonny i'll wait your boss is dead i know you're not in the muscle end of the family, so don't be scared i want you to help the corleones and me we got him outside his office about an hour after we picked you up drink it it's up to you to make peace between me and sonny sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?and you knew it was the right thing to do - sonny will come after you  - that will be his first reaction, sure so you have to talk sense into him  the tattaglia family is behind me the other new york families will go along with anything to prevent war let's face it, with all due respect, the don rest in peace was slipping ten years ago, could i have gotten to him?well, now he's dead, tom, and nothing can bring him back you've got to talk to sonny, to the caporegimes, tessio, fat clemenza it's good business, tom i'll try  but even sonny won't be able to call off luca brasi yeah, well   let me worry about luca you just talk to sonny and the other two kids - i'll do my best  - good now you can go i don't like violence, tom  i'm a businessman blood is a big expense he's still alive they hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!that's bad luck for me, and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal your mother is at the hospital with your father looks like he'll pull through it's a lot of bad blood  sollozzo, philip tattaglia, bruno tattaglia, ramon   - you gonna kill all those guys? - stay out of it if you get rid of sollozzo, everything falls into line what about luca? sollozzo thinks he can control him if luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble - has anyone been in touch with luca? - we've been trying all night - hey, do me a favor    - luca never sleeps over with a broad well, tom, you're consigliere  what do we do if the old man dies?if we lose the old man, we lose the political contacts and half our strength the other new york families might support sollozzo to avoid a long war this is almost 1946  nobody wants bloodshed anymore if your father diesyou make the deal - easy to say  he's not your father  - i'm as much a son as you or mike what is it?- paulie, i told you to stay put  - the guy at the gates has a package tessio, go see what it is - shall i stay? - yeah  are you all right?- i'm

first thing on your list  - understood mickey, tomorrow, get some guys and go to luca's apartment maybe we shouldn't get mike mixed up in this too directly hanging around the house on the phone would

they did to father  - we should listen to them no more! not this time, consigliere no more meetings, discussions, or sollozzo tricks i want sollozzo, or we go to war   - the other families    - they hand me sollozzo!this is business, not personal!- they shot my father    - even that was business, not personal then business will have to suffer  do me a favor no more advice on how to patch things up  just help me win i found out about captain mccluskey, who broke mike's jaw he's definitely on sollozzo's payroll, and for big money mccluskey has agreed to be the turk's bodyguard so when sollozzo is being guarded, he's invulnerable nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain all the families would come after you  the corleone family would be outcasts!even the old man's political protection would run for cover do me a favor  take this into consideration all right, we'll wait we can't wait  we can't wait no matter what sollozzo says, he's going to kill pop that's the key for him  we've got to get sollozzo - mike is right  - let me ask you something what about this mccluskey? what do we do with this cop?they want to have a meeting with me, right?it will be me, mccluskey and sollozzo let's set the meeting get our informers to find out where it's going to be held we insist it's a public place  a bar, a restaurant some place where there are people, so i feel safe they'll search me when i meet them, right?so i can't have a weapon on me but if clemenza can figure out a way to have a weapon planted there for methen i'll kill them both nice college boy  didn't want to get mixed up in the family business now you want to shoot a police captain because he slapped you?this isn't like the army! you have to get close and get their brains on your suit you're taking this very personal tom, this is business and he's taking it personal - where does it say you can't kill a cop? - mikey   i'm talking about a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop a cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming that's a terrific story  we have newspaper people on the payroll, right?- they might like a story like that  - they might it's not personal, sonny  it's strictly business it's as cold as they come impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints i put a special tape on the trigger and the butt  try it is the trigger too tight?my ears!i left it noisy, so it scares away any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders you've shot them both  now what do you do?- sit down, finish my dinner  - don't fool around let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out everybody will still think you've got it  they'll stare at your face,so walk out fast, but don't run don't look anybody in the eye, but don't look away either they'll be scared stiff, so don't worry about nothing you'll be all right  you'll take a vacation, nobody knows where,and we'll catch the hell - how bad do you think it will be? - pretty goddamn bad all the other families will probably line up against us these things have to happen every five, 10 years gets rid of the bad blood been 10 years since the last one  you have to stop them at the beginning like they should have stopped hitler in munich, not letting him get away with it you know, mike, we were all proud of you  being a hero and all your father too nothing  not a hint  absolutely nothing even sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held how much time do we have?they're going to pick you up outside jack dempsey's in an hour and a half - we could put a tail on them  - sollozzo would lose our ass - what about the negotiator? - he's playing pinochle with my men - he's happy  they're letting him win  - too risky  maybe we should call it off the negotiator plays cards until mike is back safe - he could blast whoever is in the car  - they'll expect that sollozzo might not even be in the car, sonny!i'll get it louis' restaurant in the bronx - is it reliable? - my man in mccluskey's precinct a police captain is on call 24 hours a day  he'll be there between 8 and 10 - anybody know this joint? - sure, i do  it's perfect for us a small family place, good food  everyone minds his business  perfect they've got an old-fashioned toilet  you know, the box and the chain thing we might be able to tape the gun behind it all right  mike, you go to the restaurant,you eat, talk for a while, you relax  make them relax then you go to take a leak  no, better still, you ask permission to go then you come back blasting  two shots in the head apiece i want somebody very good to plant that gun i don't want him coming out with just his dick - the gun will be there  - you drive him and pick him up let's move did he tell you to drop the gun right away?yeah, a million times don't forget  two shots apiece in the head as soon as you come out how long do you think it will be before i can come back?at least a year i'll square it with mom, that you're not seeing her before you leave and   i'll get a message to that girlfriend when the time is right take care take care, mike i'm glad you came  i hope we can straighten everything out it's not the way i wanted things to go  it should never have happened i want to straighten everything out  i don't want my father bothered again i swear on my children that he won't be, mike but you have to keep an open mind when we talk i hope you're not a hothead like sonny  you can't talk business with him he's a good kid i'm sorry about the other night, mike i've got to frisk you, so turn around  on your knees, facing me i guess i'm getting too old for my job  too grouchy can't stand the aggravation  you know how it is he's clean going to jersey?maybe nice work, lou - how's the food in this restaurant? - try the veal  it's the best in the city i'll have it - i'm going to speak italian to mikey  - go ahead what i want   what's most important to meis that i have a guarantee  no more attempts on my father's life what guarantees can i give you? i'm the hunted one!i missed my chance  you think too much of me, kid i'm not that clever all i want is a truce i have to go to the bathroom  is it all right?when you got to go, you got to go he's clean don't take too long i've frisked a thousand punks okay, you take over i love you, grandpa i'm sorry, pa  he doesn't know you yet - hey, big guy  give it to grandpa  - okay

set the table since mccluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on our operations and also the other families  there's been a lot of bad blood they hit us, so we hit them back through our newspaper contacts we've been able to put out materialabout mccluskey's link with sollozzo in the drug rackets so things are loosening up and i'm sending fredo to las vegas,under the protection of don francesco of l a - i want him to rest  - i'm going to learn the casino business where's michael?it was michael who killed sollozzo but he's safe  we're starting to work to bring him back i want you to

barzini, i want to thank you for helping me organize this meeting,and the other heads of the five families from new york and new jersey carmine cuneo from the bronx,and from brooklynphilip tattaglia and from staten islandwe have with us victor strachi and the other associates that came as far as from california and kansas cityand all the other territories of the country  thank you how did things ever get so far?i don't know it was so unfortunate, so unnecessary tattaglia lost a son, and i lost a son we're quits  and if tattaglia agrees,then i'm willing to let things go on as before we're grateful to don corleone for calling this meeting we all know him as a man of his word  a modest man who listens to reason yes, don barzini  he's too modest he had all the judges and politicians in his pocket he refused to share them when did i ever refuse an accommodation?all of you know me when did i ever refuse, except one time? and why?because i believe this drug business will destroy us in the years to come it's not like gambling or liquor or even women,which is something that most people want, but is forbidden by the church even the police that have helped us in the past with gambling and other thingsare going to refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics i believed that then and i believe that now times have changed it's not like the old days, when we could do anything we wanted a refusal is not the act of a friend if don corleone had all the judges and politicians, then he must share themor let others use them  he must let us draw the water from the well certainly he can present a bill for such services after all, we're not communists i also don't believe in drugs for years i paid my people extra, so they wouldn't do that kind of business somebody says to them \" i have powders \"\" if you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,we can make 50,000 distributing \"they can't resist  i want to control it as a business, keep it respectable i don't want it near schools, i don't want it sold to children thats an inf\u00e3\u00a0mia in my city we would keep the traffic to the colored they're animals, so let them lose their souls i hoped that we could come here and reason together and i'm willing to do whatever is necessary to find a peaceful solution we are agreed  the traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled don corleone will give us protection in the east, and there will be peace i must have strict assurance from corleone as time goes by and his position becomes stronger,will he attempt any individual vendetta?we are all reasonable men  we don't have to give assurances you talk about vengeance will vengeance bring your son back to you?or my boy to me?i forgo the vengeance of my son but i have selfish reasons my youngest son was forced to leave this countrybecause of this sollozzo business and i have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely cleared of all these false charges but i'm a superstitious man if an unlucky accident should befall him, if he should be shot by a police officer,or if he should hang himself in his jail cell,or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,then i'm going to blame some of the people in this room and that i do not forgive but, that asidelet me say that i swearon the souls of my grandchildren,that i will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today should i insist that all of tattaglia's drug middlemen have clean records?mention it  don't insist - barzini will know without being told  - you mean tattaglia tattaglia's a pimp he could never have outfought santino but i didn't know until this day that it was barzini all along come on, nancy keep together, everyone  brian okay, all right how long have you been back?i've been back a year longer than that, i think it's good to see you, kay i'm working for my father now, kay he's been sick  very sick but you're not like him you told me you weren't going to become like your father my father is no different than any other powerful man any man who's responsible for other people like a senator or president - how naive you sound  - why?they don't have men killed who's being naive, kay?my father's way of doing things is over  even he knows that in five years the corleone family is going to be completely legitimate trust me  that's all i can tell you about my business  kay   michael, why did you come here? why?what do you want with me after all this time?i've been calling and writing i came because i need you  i care for you - please stop it, michael  - because    i want you to marry me - it's too late  - please, kay   i'll do anything you ask to make up for what's happened to us because that's important, kay  because what's important is thatwe have each other  that we have a life together that we have children  our children kay, i need you and i love you barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it!- soon i'll have no place to hang my hat! - be patient i'm not asking for help  just take off the handcuffs - be patient  - we must protect ourselves - let me recruit some new men  - no - barzini would get an excuse to fight  - mike, you're wrong don corleone   you once said that one day tessio and me could form our own family till today i would never think of it  i must ask your permission michael is now head of the family if he gives his permission, then you have my blessing after we make the move to nevadayou can leave the corleone family and go on your own - how long will that be? - six months forgive me, but with you gone,me and pete will come under barzini's thumb i hate that barzini  in six months' time there will be nothing left to build on - do you have faith in my judgment? - yes - do i have your loyalty? - always, godfather then be a friend to michael  do as he says things are negotiated that'll solve your problems and answer your questions that's all i can tell you now carlo, you grew up in nevada when we make our move there, you'll be my right-hand man tom hagen is no longer consigliere  he'll be our lawyer in vegas that's no reflection on tom, just how i want it if i ever need help, who's a better consigliere than my father? that's it - thank you, papa  - i'm happy for you, carlo mike    why am i out?you're not a wartime consigliere, tom things may get rough with the move tom i advised michael  i never thought you were a bad consigliere i thought santino was a bad don, rest in peace michael has all my confidence, just as you do but there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen - maybe i could help  - you're out, tom i can't get over the way your face looks  so good!this doctor did some job  did kay talk you into it? hey, hey, hey!leave them out here  he's tired and wants to clean up let me open the door, all

mediterranean to oran then, by train or auto or foot, across the rim of africa      to casablanca in french morocco here, the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck      might obtain exit visas and scurry to lisbon and from lisbon to the new world but the others wait in casablanca and wait and wait      and wait to all officers:two german couriers carrying official documents murdered on train from oran murderer and possible accomplices headed for casablanca round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document important may we see your papers?i don't think i have them on me - in that case, you'll have to come along  - wait  it's possible that i   yes  here they are these papers expired three weeks ago  you'll have to come along halt!halt!- what on earth is going on there? - i don't know, my dear pardon, monsieur  pardon, madame  have you not heard?we hear very little, and we understand even less two german couriers were found murdered in the desert  the unoccupied desert this is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals      and, of course, a beautiful young girl for renault, the prefect of police along with these unhappy refugees, the scum of europe has gravitated to casablanca some of them have been waiting years for a visa i beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself  be on guard this place is full of vultures vultures everywhere  everywhere!- thank you  thank you very much  - not at all what an amusing little fellow waiter - oh, how silly of me  - what, dear?i've left my wallet in the hotel perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane it is good to see you again, major strasser thank you, thank you may i present captain renault, police prefect of casablanca  major strasser unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca thank you, captain  it's good to be here major strasser, my aide, lieutenant casselle captain tonnelli  the italian service at your command that is kind of you you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm we germans must get used to all climates, from russia to the sahara - perhaps you weren't referring to weather  - what else?the murder of the couriers  what has been done?my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects - but we know already who the murderer is  - good  is he in custody?no hurry  tonight he'll be at rick's  everybody comes to rick's i've already heard about this caf\u00e3\u00a9  and also about mr  rick himself waiting, waiting, waiting i'll never get out of here i'll die in casablanca but can't you make it just a little more?please?sorry, but diamonds are a drug on the market  everybody sells diamonds there are diamonds everywhere  2400 all right the trucks are waiting  the men are waiting  everything--it's the fishing smack santiago it leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here from the end of la medina  third boat - thank you  thank you  - and bring 15,000 francs in cash remember, in cash cheerio - open up, abdul  - yes, professor - waiter? - yes, madame?will you ask rick if he'll have a drink with us?madame, he never drinks with customers  never  i have never seen it what makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?perhaps if you told him i ran the second-largest banking house in amsterdam second largest? that wouldn't impress rick the leading banker in amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen we have something to look forward to and his father is the bellboy excuse me i'm sorry, sir  this is a private room of all the nerve  who do you think--? i know there is gambling in there - you dare not keep me out  - yes? what's the trouble?i have been in every gambling room between honolulu and berlin and if you think i'm going to be kept out of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken excuse me, please  hello, rick your cash is good at the bar what? do you know who i am?i do  you're lucky the bar is open to you this is outrageous! i shall report it to the angriff you know, watching you just now, one would think you've been doing this all your life - what makes you think i haven't? - nothing - but when you first came, i thought-- - you thought what?what right do i have to think?may i?too bad about those two german couriers, wasn't it?they got a lucky break  yesterday they were just clerks      today they are the honored dead you are a very cynical person, rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so i forgive you - will you have a drink with me? - no i forgot, you never drink with-- i'll have another, please you despise me, don't you?if i gave you any thought, i probably would but why?do you object to the kind of business i do?but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i didn't help them that's not so bad  through ways of my own, i provide them with exit visas for a price, ugarte  for a price but think of all the poor devils who can't meet renault's price i get it for them for half  is that so parasitic?i don't mind a parasite  i object to a cut-rate one well, after tonight i will be through with the whole business and i'm leaving, finally, this casablanca who did you bribe for your visa? renault or yourself?myself  i found myself much more reasonable look, rick know what this is?something that even you have never seen letters of transit signed by general de gaulle cannot be rescinded  not even questioned one moment tonight i'll be selling those for more money than i ever dreamed of and then, addio, casablanca i have many a friend in casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me      you are the only one i trust will you keep these for me, please?- for how long? - perhaps an hour  perhaps a little longer - i don't want them here overnight  - don't be afraid of that please keep them for me thank you  i knew i could trust you waiter  i'll be expecting some people if anybody asks for me, i'll be right here rick      i hope you're more impressed with me now if you'll forgive me, i'll share my good luck with your roulette wheel just a moment i heard a rumor those two german couriers were carrying letters of transit i've heard that rumor too  poor devils you're right, ugarte  i am a little more impressed with you - hello, rick  - hello, ferrari how's business at the blue parrot?- fine, but i'd like to buy your caf\u00e3\u00a9  - it's not for sale - you haven't heard my offer  - it's not for sale at any price - what do you want for sam? - i don't buy or sell human beings too bad  that's casablanca's leading commodity in refugees alone we could make a fortune, if you'd work with me in the black market suppose you run your business and let me run mine suppose we ask sam  maybe he'd like to make a change suppose we do when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?sam, ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot oh, i like it fine here - he'll double what i pay you  - i ain't got time to spend what i make here sorry the boss's private stock   -    because, yvonne, i love you  - oh, shut up all right, all right  for you, i shut up, because, yvonne, i love you some germans gave this check  is it all right?where were you last night?that's so long ago, i don't remember - will i see you tonight? - i never make plans that far ahead give me another - sascha, she's had enough  - don't listen to him  fill it up yvonne, i love you, but he pays me - rick, i'm tired of having you-- - sascha, call a cab - we're gonna get your coat  - take your hands off me you're going home  you've had a little too much to drink hey, taxi who do you think you are, pushing me around?i was a fool to fall for a man like you go with her, sascha  be sure she gets home and come right back yes, boss - hello, rick  - hello, louis how extravagant you are, throwing away women someday they may be scarce i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound when it comes to women, you're a true democrat if he gets a word in, it'll be a major italian victory the plane to lisbon you would like to be on it?why? what's in lisbon?the clipper to america i've often speculated on why you don't return to america did you abscond with the church funds? did you run off with a senator's wife?i like to think you killed a man  it's the romantic in me it's a combination of all three and what in heaven's name brought you to casablanca?my health  i came to casablanca for the waters the waters? what waters? we're in the desert i was misinformed excuse me, monsieur rick a gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs      and the cashier would like some money i'll get it from the safe i'm so upset, rick  you know i--forget it, emil  mistakes like that happen all the time i'm awfully sorry rick, there will be some excitement here tonight  an arrest in your caf\u00e3\u00a9 - again? - this is no ordinary arrest a murderer, no less if you're thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out  he cannot escape - i stick my neck out for nobody  - a wise foreign policy could have made the arrest earlier, at the blue parrot out of my regard for you, we're staging it here it will amuse your customers our entertainment's enough we're to have an important guest here tonight major strasser of the third reich, no less we want him to be here when we make the arrest a demonstration of the efficiency of my administration i see  and what's strasser doing here?he certainly didn't come here to witness a demonstration of your efficiency - perhaps not  - here - it shall not happen again  - that's all right louis, you got something on your mind  why don't you spill it how observant you are as a matter of fact, i wanted to give you a word of advice yeah?- have a brandy? - thank you there are many exit visas sold in this caf\u00e3\u00a9, but we know that you've never sold one that is the reason we permit you to remain open i thought it was because i let you win at roulette that is another reason there is a man arrived in casablanca on his way to america he will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish an exit visa - what's his name? - victor laszlo victor laszlo?rick, that is the first time i've seen you so impressed he's succeeded in impressing half the world it's my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half laszlo must never reach america  he stays in casablanca it'll be interesting to see how he manages - manages what? - his escape - but i just told you-- - stop it he escaped from a concentration camp  the nazis have chased him all over europe this is the end of the chase twenty thousand francs says it isn't is that a serious offer?i just paid out 20, and i'd like to get it back make it 10  i'm only a poor corrupt official - okay  - done no matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa  or i should say two - why two? - he is traveling with a lady - he'll take one  - i think not  i've seen the lady and if he did not leave her in marseilles or oran      he certainly won't leave her in casablanca maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are it doesn't matter  there is no exit visa for him what ever gave you the impression that i might help laszlo escape?because, my dear ricky, i suspect that under that cynical shell      you are at heart a sentimentalist laugh if you will, but i happen to be familiar with your record let me point out just two items:in 1935, you ran guns to ethiopia in 1936, you fought in spain on the loyalist side and got well paid for it on both occasions the winning side would have paid you much better maybe it seems you're determined to keep laszlo here i have my orders i see  gestapo spank my dear ricky, you overestimate the influence of the gestapo i don't interfere with them, and they don't interfere with me in casablanca, i am master of my fate - i am-- - major strasser is here, sir - you were saying? - excuse me carl, see that major strasser gets a good table, close to the ladies i have already given him the best, knowing he is german and would take it anyway take him quietly  two guards at every door - everything is ready, sir  - go ahead - good evening, gentlemen  - good evening, captain - won't you join us? - thank you - it's a pleasure to have you here, major  - champagne and a tin of caviar may i recommend veuve clicquot '26, a good french wine very well, sir - a very interesting club  - especially so tonight, major in a few minutes you'll see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers i expected no less, captain monsieur ugarte - will you please come with us? - certainly may i first please cash my chips?very lucky, huh? two thousand, please rick! rick, help me!- don't be a fool  you can't get away  - but, rick, hide me  do something!excellent, captain when they come for me, i hope you'll be more of a help i stick my neck out for nobody i'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now just sit down and have a good time  enjoy yourselves  all right, sam rick, this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich - how do you do, mr  rick? - how do you do?you already know herr heinze of the third reich please join us, mr  rick we are very honored tonight major strasser is one of the reasons the third reich enjoys the reputation it has you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others well, personally, major, i will take what comes do you mind if i ask you a few questions?- unofficially, of course  - make it official if you like - what is your nationality? - i'm a drunkard and that makes rick a citizen of the world i was born in new york city, if that'll help you any i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation there seems to be no secret about that are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris?it's not particularly my beloved paris can you imagine us in london?when you get there, ask me diplomatist how about new york?well, there are sections of new york, major, that i wouldn't advise you to try to invade - who do you think will win the war? - i haven't the slightest idea rick is completely neutral about everything  and that takes in the field of women too you were not always so carefully neutral  we have a complete dossier on you \"richard blaine, american  age: 37  cannot return to his country \"the reason is a little vague  we also know what you did in paris and also we know why you left paris  don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it are my eyes really brown?you will forgive my curiosity, mr  blaine  the point is      an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca      and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one in this case you have no sympathy for the fox?not particularly  i understand the point of view of the hound too laszlo published the foulest lies in the prague newspapers      until the day we marched in and even after that, he continued to print scandal sheets in his cellar of course, one must admit he has great courage i admit he's clever  three times he slipped through our fingers in paris he continued his activities  we intend not to let it happen again excuse me, gentlemen  your business is politics, mine is running a saloon good evening, mr  blaine you see, major? you have nothing to worry about rick perhaps - i reserved a table  victor laszlo  - yes, monsieur laszlo  right this way two cointreaux, please i saw no one of ugarte's description victor, i feel somehow we shouldn't stay here if we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us perhaps ugarte is in some other part of the caf\u00e3\u00a9 excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to america you'll find a market there for this ring  i'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice - thank you, but i hardly think    - perhaps for the lady the ring is quite unique - yes, i'm very interested  - good what is your name?berger, norwegian  at your service, sir i'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar we don't want the ring, but thanks for showing it to us - such a bargain  but that is your decision? - i'm sorry, it is - monsieur laszlo, is it not? - yes?i am captain renault, prefect of police yes, what is it you want?merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay it isn't often we have so distinguished a visitor thank you  i hope you'll forgive me, captain the present french administration hasn't always been so cordial may i present miss ilsa lund i was told you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit casablanca that was a gross understatement you're very kind - won't you join us? - if you will permit me oh, no, emile, please  a bottle of your best champagne  and put it on my bill it's a game we play  they put it on the bill, i tear up the bill  it is very convenient captain, the boy who's playing the piano   somewhere i've seen him - sam? - yes he came from paris with rick rick? who is he?- mademoiselle, you are in rick's  rick is    - is what?mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that, well, if i were a woman      and i were not around, i should be in love with rick but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man excuse me major mademoiselle lund and monsieur laszlo, may i present major strasser how do you do?this is a pleasure i have looked forward to i'm sure you'll excuse me if i'm not gracious you see, major strasser, i am a czechoslovakian you were a czechoslovakian  now you are a subject of the german reich i have never accepted that privilege  and i'm now on french soil i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil this is hardly the time or place then we shall state another time and place  tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office with mademoiselle captain, i am under your authority is it your order that we come to your office?let us say it is my request  that is a much more pleasant word very well a very clever tactical retreat, major - this time they really mean to stop me  - victor, i'm afraid for you we've been in difficult places before, haven't we?i must find out what berger knows - be careful  - i will  don't worry monsieur berger, the ring  could i see it again?champagne cocktail, please i recognize you from the news photographs, monsieur laszlo in a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight we read five times that you were killed in five different places as you see, it was true every single time thank heaven i found you, berger i'm looking for a man by the name of ugarte  he's supposed to help me ugarte cannot even help himself he's under arrest for murder  he was arrested here tonight i see but we who are still free will do all we can  we are organized underground, like everywhere else tomorrow night there is a meeting at the caverne du bois if you will come--will you ask the piano player to come over here?very well, mademoiselle - how's the jewelry business, berger? - not so good  check, please too bad you weren't here earlier  we had quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, berger?yes  excuse me, gentlemen - my bill  - no  two champagne cocktails  please - hello, sam  - hello, miss ilsa i never expected to see you again it's been a long time yes, ma'am  a lot of water under the bridge - some of the old songs, sam  - yes, ma'am where is rick?i don't know  i ain't seen him all night - when will he be back? - not tonight no more  he ain't coming--he went home - does he always leave so early? - he never--well, he's got a girl up to the blue parrot goes up there all the time you used to be a much better liar, sam leave him alone, miss ilsa  you're bad luck to him play it once, sam  for old times' sake i don't know what you mean, miss ilsa play it, sam play \"as time goes by \"i can't remember it, miss ilsa  i'm a little rusty on it i'll hum it for you sing it, sam sam, i thought i told you never to play--well, you were asking about rick, and here he is  may i present--- hello, ilsa  - hello, rick oh, you've already met rick, mademoiselle? then perhaps you also--this is mr  laszlo - how do you do? - how do you do?one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca and about victor laszlo everywhere - won't you join us for a drink? - rick never--- thanks, i will  - well      a precedent is being broken  emile - interesting caf\u00e3\u00a9  i congratulate you  - i congratulate you - what for? - your work thank you  i try we all try  you succeed she was asking about you earlier, rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous i wasn't sure you were the same - let's see, the last time we met-- - was la belle aurore how nice  you remembered but, of course, that was the day the germans marched into paris not an easy day to forget i remember every detail  the germans wore gray, you wore blue yes  i put that dress away when the germans march out i'll wear it again ricky, you're becoming quite human  i suppose we have to thank you for that ilsa, i don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late so it is  we have a curfew in casablanca  it would never do for the chief of police      to be found drinking after hours - i hope we didn't overstay our welcome  - not at all - your check, sir  - it's my party another precedent gone  this has been a very interesting evening i'll call you a cab  gasoline rationing, time of night - we'll come again  - anytime - say good night to sam for me  - i will there's still nobody in the world who can play \"as time goes by\" like sam he hasn't played it in a long time - good night  - good night night a very puzzling fellow, this rick  what sort is he?i really can't say, though i saw him quite often in paris - tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office  - we'll be there - good night  - good night boss?- boss? - yeah?- boss, ain't you going to bed? - not right now ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?- you ever going to bed? - no well, i ain't sleepy, either good, then have a drink - not me, boss  - then don't have a drink boss, let's get out of here no, sir  i'm waiting for a lady please, let's go  ain't nothing but trouble for you here she's coming back  i know she's coming back we'll take the car and drive all night we'll get drunk  we'll go fishing, stay away until she's gone - shut up and go home, will you? - no, sir, i'm staying right here they grab ugarte, then she walks in that's the way it goes  one in, one out - sam  - yes, boss?if it's december 1941 in casablanca, what time is it in new york?what?my watch stopped i bet they're asleep in new york i bet they're asleep all over america of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world      she walks into mine - what's that you're playing? - a little something of my own - well, stop it  you know what i want to hear  - no, i don't you played it for her  you can play it for me - i don't think i can remember-- - if she can stand it, i can play it yes, boss who are you really? and what were you before?what did you do, and what did you think?we said no questions here's looking at you, kid a franc for your thoughts in america they'd bring only a penny i guess that's about all they're worth i'm willing to be overcharged  tell me well, i was wondering   why i'm so lucky  why i should find you waiting for me to come along why there is no other man in my life?that's easy  there was he's dead i'm sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions only one answer can take care of all our questions nothing can stop them now  wednesday, thursday at the latest, they'll be in paris richard, they'll find out your record  you won't be safe here i'm on their blacklist already  their roll of honor henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the germans drink it this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it?you said it here's looking at you, kid my german's a little rusty it's the gestapo they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow they're telling us how to act when they come marching in with the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love it's pretty bad timing - where were you, say, 10 years ago? - 10 years ago?let's see yes, i was having a brace put on my teeth  where were you?looking for a job was that cannon fire?or is it my heart pounding?it's the new german 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away and getting closer every minute here, here, drink up we'll never finish the other three them germans will be here pretty soon, and they'll come looking for you and don't forget, there's a price on your head i left a note in my apartment  they'll know where to find me it's strange - i know so very little about you  - i know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened be serious, darling  you are in danger  you must leave paris no, we must leave yes, of course  we the train for marseilles leaves at 5:00  i'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30 not at my hotel  i   i have things to do in the city before i leave i'll meet you at the station all right, at a quarter to 5 why don't we get married in marseilles?that's too far ahead to plan yes  i guess it is too far ahead let's see    what about the engineer? why can't he marry us on the train?why not? the captain on a ship can  it doesn't seem fair that--hey, what's wrong, kid?i love you so much and i hate this war so much it's a crazy world  anything can happen if you shouldn't get away   if something should keep us apart      wherever they put you      and wherever i'll be, i want you to know that i   kiss me kiss me as if it were the last time where is she? have you seen her?i can't find her  she checked out of the hotel but this note came just after you left that's the last call, mr  richard do you hear me?come on, mr  richard  let's get out of here  come on rick, i have to talk to you i saved my first drink to have with you  here - no, rick  not tonight  - especially tonight why did you have to come to casablanca? there are other places i wouldn't have come if i'd known you were here believe me, rick, it's true  i didn't know it's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed  i can still hear it \"richard, dear, i'll go with you anyplace - we'll get on a train and never stop \" - don't, rick i can understand how you feel you understand how i feel how long was it we had, honey?- i didn't count the days  - well, i did every one of them mostly i remember the last one the wild finish  a guy standing on a station platform in the rain      with a comical look on his face      because his insides have been kicked out can i tell you a story, rick?does it got a wild finish?i don't know the finish yet go on, tell it  maybe one'll come to you as you go along it's about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo at the house of some friends      she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life a very great and courageous man he opened up for her a whole beautiful world      full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals everything she knew or ever became was because of him and she looked up to him      and worshiped him      with a feeling she supposed was love yes, that's very pretty i heard a story once  in fact, i've heard a lot of stories in my time they went along with the sound of a tinny piano      playing in the parlor downstairs \"mister, i met a man once when i was a kid,\" they'd always begin i guess neither one of our stories is very funny tell me      who was it you left me for?was it laszlo, or were there others in between      or aren't you the kind that tells?i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr  blaine i would suggest you search the caf\u00e3\u00a9 immediately if rick has the letters, he's too smart to let you find them there you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was he's just another blundering american we mustn't underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918 as to laszlo, we want him watched 24 hours a day it may interest you to know that at this very moment he's on his way here there is nothing we can do i'm delighted to see you  did you have a good night's rest?i slept very well strange  nobody's supposed to sleep well in casablanca - may we proceed with the business? - with pleasure  won't you sit down?laszlo, we will not mince words  you're an escaped prisoner of the reich so far you have been fortunate in eluding us you have reached casablanca it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca whether or not you will succeed is problematic not at all  renault's signature is necessary on every visa captain, is it possible that laszlo will receive a visa?i'm afraid not  my regrets, monsieur well, perhaps i shall like it in casablanca and mademoiselle?- you needn't be concerned about me  - is that all you wish to tell us?don't be in such a hurry  you have all the time in the world you may be in casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow - on one condition  - and that is?you know the leader of the underground movement in paris, in prague      brussels, amsterdam      oslo, belgrade, athens   - even berlin  - yes, even in berlin if you will furnish me with their names and whereabouts      you'll have your visa in the morning and the honor of having served the third reich i was in a german concentration camp for a year - that's honor enough for a lifetime  - you will give us the names?if i didn't give them to you in a concentration camp      where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal      i certainly won't give them to you now and what if you track down these men and kill them?what if you murdered all of us?from every corner of europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places even nazis can't kill that fast herr laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand but in one aspect you are mistaken you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced but there is one exception no one could take your place if anything unfortunate      should occur to you while you were trying to escape you won't dare to interfere with me here this is still unoccupied france any violation of neutrality would reflect on captain renault - monsieur, insofar as it is in my power  - thank you by the way, monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte i believe you have a message for him?nothing important  but may i speak to him now?you would find the conversation a trifle one-sided signor ugarte is dead i'm making out the report now we haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide      or died trying to escape - are you quite finished with us? - for the time being good day undoubtedly, their next step will be to the black market excuse me, captain another visa problem has come up - show her in  - yes, sir sorry, monsieur, we were never to handle the police - this is a job for signor ferrari  - ferrari?it can be most helpful to know signor ferrari he pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here you will find him at the blue parrot thanks don't be too downhearted perhaps you can come to terms with renault thank you very much, signor - hello, ferrari  - good morning, rick the bus is in  i'll take my shipment with me i'll have it sent over  have a drink with me i never drink in the morning  and every time you send my shipment over it's a little short carrying charges, my boy  carrying charges here, sit down there is something i want to talk over with you, anyhow bourbon the news about ugarte upsets me very much you're a fat hypocrite  you don't feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do of course not  what upsets me is that ugarte is dead      and no one knows where those letters are practically no one if i had those letters, i could make a fortune so could i, and i'm a poor businessman i have a proposition for whoever has those letters  i'll handle the entire transaction get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage and the carrying charges?naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that's my proposition for whoever has those letters i'll tell him when he comes in rick, i think you know where those letters are you're in good company  renault and strasser probably think so too that's why i came here  to give them a chance to ransack my place rick, don't be a fool  take me into your confidence  you need a partner excuse me, i'll be getting back - morning  - signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table you will not find a treasure like this in all morocco only 700 francs - you're being cheated  - doesn't matter, thank you for friends of rick's we have a small discount did i say 700 francs? you can have it for 200 i'm sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night doesn't matter for special friends of rick's we have a special discount  100 francs your story had me a little confused  or maybe it was the bourbon i have some tablecloths, napkins--- thank you  i'm really not interested  - please, one minute why did you come back? to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?yes well, you can tell me now  i'm reasonably sober i don't think i will, rick why not? after all, i got stuck with a railway ticket  i think i'm entitled to know last night i saw what has happened to you the rick i knew in paris, i could tell him, he'd understand but the one who looked at me with such hatred   i'll be leaving casablanca soon  we'll never see each other again we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris if we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not casablanca not last night did you run out on me because you knew what it would be like?hiding from the police, running away all the time?you can believe that if you want to well, i'm not running away anymore  i'm settled now above a saloon, it's true      but walk up a flight      i'll be expecting you all the same, someday you'll lie to laszlo you'll be there no, rick no  you see, victor laszlo is my husband and was, even when i knew you in paris i was just telling monsieur laszlo that unfortunately i'm not able to help him you see, my dear, word has gone around as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca, i am influential and respected but it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo you, however, are a different matter signor ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you - you mean for me to go on alone? - and only alone i'll stay here and keep on trying  i'm sure in a little while--might as well be frank, monsieur it would take a miracle to get you out  the germans have outlawed miracles we are only interested in two visas - please, ilsa, don't be hasty  - no, victor you two will want to discuss this excuse me  i'll be at the bar no, ilsa  i won't let you stay here you must get to america  believe me, somehow i will get out and join you but if the situation were different      if i had to stay and there were only visa for one      would you take it?yes, i would yes, i see when i had trouble getting out of lille, why didn't you leave me there?when i was sick in marseilles for two weeks and you were in danger every minute      why didn't you leave me then?i meant to, but something always held me up i love you very much, ilsa your secret will be safe with me ferrari is waiting for our answer not more than 50 francs we've decided, signor ferrari for the present we will go on looking for two visas  thank you very much well, good luck, but be careful - you know you're being shadowed? - of course  it becomes an instinct i observe that you, in one respect, are a very fortunate man i am moved to make one more suggestion  why, i do not know because it cannot possibly profit me have you heard about ugarte and the letters of transit?yes, something those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him - you know where they are? - not for sure but i'd guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick a difficult customer, that rick  one never knows what he'll do or why but it is worth a chance thank you very much  good day goodbye  thank you for your coffee  i shall miss that when we leave casablanca gracious of you to share it with me  good day, mademoiselle - monsieur  - good day - here's to you, sir  - good luck - i'd better be going  - my check, please i have to warn you, sir  this is a dangerous place  full of vultures - vultures everywhere  thanks for everything  - goodbye it has been a pleasure to meet you i'm sorry monsieur rick, you are getting to be your best customer well, drinking  i'm very pleased with you you're beginning to live like a frenchman that was some going-over your men gave my place we barely got cleaned up in time to open i told strasser he wouldn't find the letters here but i told my men to be especially destructive you know how that impresses germans rick, have you got those letters of transit?louis, are you pro-vichy or free french?serves me right for asking a direct question  the subject is closed it looks like you're a little late so yvonne's gone over to the enemy who knows? in her own way, she may constitute an entire second front i think it's time for me to flatter strasser a little  i'll see you later sascha!french 75s put up a whole row of them, sascha  starting here and ending here we will begin with two what did you say? would you kindly repeat it?- what i said is none of your business  - i'll make it my business i don't like disturbances in my place  either lay off politics or get out you see, captain?the situation is not as under control as you believe we try to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people captain, are you certain which side you're on?i have no conviction, if that's what you mean i blow with the wind      and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy and if it should change?surely the reich doesn't admit that possibility?we are concerned about more than casablanca we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance  waiting perhaps for a leader a leader? like laszlo?i have been thinking it's too dangerous to let him go, it may be too dangerous to let him stay i see what you mean thank you, carl thank you, carl sit down  have a brandy with us to celebrate our leaving for america tomorrow thank you very much i thought you would ask me, so i brought the good brandy      and a third glass at last the day's came!frau leuchtag and i are speaking nothing but english now so we should feel at home when we get to america a very nice idea to america to america what watch?- ten watch  - such much?you will get along beautifully in america how is lady luck treating you?oh, too bad you'll find him over there - monsieur rick? - yes?- could i speak to you, please? - how'd you get in here? you're underage - i came with captain renault  - i should have known my husband is with me too he is? captain renault's getting broad-minded  sit down have a drink?no, of course not  you mind if i do?monsieur rick   -    what kind of a man is captain renault? - like any other man, only more so no, i mean      is he trustworthy? is his word--?- just a minute  who told you to ask me that? - he did  captain renault did i thought so  where's your husband?at the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas oh, of course he's losing - how long have you been married? - eight weeks we come from bulgaria things are very bad there the devil has the people by the throat so jan and i, we   we do not want our children to grow up in such a country - so you decided to go to america  - yes but we haven't much money      and traveling is so expensive and difficult it was much more than we thought to get here and then captain renault sees us   -    and he is so kind, he wants to help us  - yes, i'll bet he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money - does he know that? - yes - and he's still willing to give you a visa? - yes - and you want to know   ? - will he keep his word?he always has you are a man if someone loved you very much      so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world      and she did a bad thing to make certain of it   -    could you forgive her? - nobody ever loved me that much and he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart      that would be all right, wouldn't it?- you want my advice? - yes, please go back to bulgaria oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe, to get to america   oh, but if jan should find out  he is such a boy in many ways i am so much older than he is yes, well, everybody in casablanca has problems - yours may work out  you'll excuse me  - thank you, monsieur - good evening  - good evening - you see? here we are again  - i take that as a great compliment to sam i suppose he means to you paris of happier days he does  could we have a table close to him?and as far away from major strasser as possible the geography may be a little difficult to arrange - paul, table 30  - yes, sir right this way, if you please i'll have sam play \"as time goes by \" i believe that's your favorite tune thank you - two cognacs, please  - cognac do you wish to place another bet, sir?no  no, i guess not have you tried 22 tonight?i said 22 leave it there cash it in and don't come back are you sure this place is honest?honest? as honest as the day is long how are we doing tonight?a couple of thousand less than i thought there would be monsieur rick   he's just a lucky guy monsieur rick, may i get you a cup of coffee?- no, thanks, carl  - monsieur rick   captain renault, may i--?not here  come to my office in the morning  we'll do everything businesslike - we'll be there at 6  - i'll be there at 10 i'm very happy for both of you still, it's very strange that you won well, maybe not so strange - i'll see you in the morning  - thank you, captain renault no!boss, you've done a beautiful thing go away, you crazy russian - as i suspected  you're a rank sentimentalist  - yeah? why?why do you interfere with my little romances?put it down as a gesture to love well, i'll forgive you this time but i'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond and it'll make me very happy if she loses - mr  blaine, i wonder if i could talk to you  - go ahead well, isn't there some other place?it's rather confidential, what i have to say - in my office  - right you must know it's very important i get out of casablanca it's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement you know what i've been doing you know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands of people      that i reach america and continue my work i'm not interested in politics the problems of the world are not in my department i'm a saloonkeeper my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record you ran guns to ethiopia - you fought against the fascists in spain  - what of it?isn't it strange you're always fighting on the side of the underdog?yes, i found that a very expensive hobby but then i never was much of a businessman are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?- i appreciate it, but i don't accept it  - 200,000 my friend, you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same there must be some reason why you won't let me there is i suggest that you ask your wife - i beg your pardon? - i said, ask your wife - my wife? - yes play \"la marseillaise \" play it!see what i mean? if laszlo's presence in a caf\u00e3\u00a9 can inspire this demonstration      what more will his presence in casablanca bring on?i advise that this place be shut up at once - but everybody's having a good time  - yes, much too good a time the place is to be closed - but i have no excuse to close it  - find one everybody is to leave immediately this caf\u00e3\u00a9 is closed until further notice clear the room at once how can you close me up?i'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here - your winnings, sir  - thank you everybody out at once after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca this morning you implied it wasn't safe to leave casablanca that is also true, except for one destination: occupied france - occupied france? - under safe conduct from me of what value is that?you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past - there are two other alternatives for him  - what are they?the french authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here the other alternative?my dear, perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap good night, mademoiselle - what happened with rick? - we'll discuss it later our faithful friend is still there please don't go to the underground meeting tonight i must besides, it isn't often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife don't joke  after major strasser's warning tonight, i'm frightened tell you the truth, i'm frightened too shall i remain here in a hotel room, hiding?or shall i carry on the best i can?whatever i'd say, you would carry on victor, why don't you tell me about rick? what did you find out?- apparently he has the letters  - yes?but no intention of selling them you'd think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would did he give any reason?- he suggested i ask you  - ask me?yes, he said, \"ask your wife \"i don't know why he said that well, our friend outside will think we've retired by now i'll be going in a few minutes - ilsa, i    - yes?when i was in the concentration camp      were you lonely in paris?yes, victor, i was i know how it is to be lonely is there anything you wish to tell me?no, victor, there isn't i love you very much, my dear yes, i know victor, whatever i do, will you believe that i   ?you don't even have to say it i'll believe good night, dear good night - victor  - yes, dear?be careful of course i'll be careful well, you are in pretty good shape, herr rick how long can i afford to stay closed?two weeks, maybe three maybe i won't have to  a bribe has worked before in the meantime, everybody stays on salary thank you, herr rick sascha will be happy to hear it  i owe him money - you finish locking up, will you, carl? - i will - then i am going to the meeting-- - don't tell me where you're going i won't good night good night, mr  rick - how did you get in? - the stairs from the street i told you this morning you'd come around, but this is ahead of schedule well, won't you sit down?- richard, i had to see you  - \"richard\" again  we're back in paris your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?seems as long as i have those letters i'll never be lonely ask any price you want, but you must give me the letters i went all through that with your husband  it's no deal i know how you feel about me      but put your feelings aside for something more important i have to hear again what a great man your husband is      what an important cause he's fighting for?it was your cause too in your own way, you were fighting for the same thing i'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself i'm the only cause i'm interested in we loved each other once  if those days meant anything at all to you--i wouldn't bring up paris if i were you  it's poor salesmanship listen to me  if you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth--i wouldn't believe you no matter what you said you'd say anything now to get what you want you want to feel sorry for yourself, don't you?with so much at stake all you can think of is your feelings one woman has hurt you, and you take your revenge on the rest of the world you're a coward and a weakling no  oh, richard  i'm sorry i'm sorry, but you are our last hope if you don't help us, victor laszlo will die in casablanca what of it?i'm going to die in casablanca  it's a good spot for it now, if you'll--all right i tried to reason with you i tried everything  now, i want those letters - get them for me  - i don't have to  i got them right here put them on the table no for the last time, put them on the table if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything all right, i'll make it easier for you go ahead and shoot  you'll be doing me a favor richard      i tried to stay away i thought i would never see you again that you were out of my life the day you left paris      if you knew what i went through if you knew how much i loved you how much i still love you and then?it wasn't long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia they needed him in prague, but there the gestapo were waiting for him just a two-line item in the paper:\"victor laszlo apprehended  sent to concentration camp \"i was frantic  for months i tried to get word then it came he was dead  shot trying to escape i was lonely  i had nothing, not even hope then i met you why weren't you honest with me? why did you keep your marriage a secret?it wasn't my secret, richard  victor wanted it that way not even our closest friends knew about our marriage that was his way of protecting me  i knew so much about his work if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me      and for those working with us and when did you first find out he was alive?just before you and i were to leave paris together a friend came and told me that victor was alive they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris he was sick  he needed me i wanted to tell you, but i didn't dare i knew you wouldn't have left paris, and the gestapo would have caught you well      well, you know the rest well, it's still a story without an ending what about now?now?i don't know i know that i'll never have the strength to leave you again and laszlo?you'll help him now, richard, won't you? you'll see that he gets out then he'll have his work  all that he's been living for all except one he won't have you i can't fight it anymore i ran away from you once  i can't do it again oh, i don't know what's right any longer you have to think for both of us for all of us all right  i will here's looking at you, kid i wish i didn't love you so much - i think we lost them  - yes - i'm afraid they caught some of the others  - come inside come, mr  laszlo, i will help you immediately thank you carl, what happened?the police break up our meeting, herr rick  we escaped at the last moment - come up here a minute  - yes, i come turn out the light in the rear entrance  it might attract the police - but sascha always puts out that light  - tonight he forgot yes, i come  i will do it - i want you to take miss lund home  - yes, sir it's nothing, just a little cut  we had to get through a window this might come in handy thank you - had a close one, eh? - yes, rather don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?i mean, what you're fighting for we might as well question why we breathe if we stop breathing, we'll die if we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die what of it? then it'll be out of its misery you know how you sound, monsieur blaine?like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart each of us has a destiny  for good, or for evil - i get the point  - i wonder if you do i wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself      and that you'll never succeed you seem to know all about my destiny i know a good deal more about you than you suspect i know that you're in love with a woman it's perhaps a strange circumstance      that we both should be in love with the same woman the first evening i came into this caf\u00e3\u00a9      i knew there was something between you and ilsa since no one is to blame      i demand no explanation i ask only one thing  you won't give me the letters of transit all right but i want my wife to be safe i ask you as a favor      to use the letters to take her away from casablanca you love her that much?apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause well, i am also a human being yes, i love her that much - monsieur laszlo? - yes?you'll come with us  we have a warrant for your arrest on what charge?captain renault will discuss that with you later it seems that destiny has taken a hand you haven't any proof, and you know it  this isn't germany or occupied france all you can do is fine him and give him 30 days  you might as well let him go now i'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo if you were to help him escape--what makes you think i'd stick my neck out for laszlo?because, one, you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape two, you've got the letters of transit  don't bother to deny it and you might do it simply because you don't like strasser's looks as a matter of fact, i don't either they're all excellent reasons don't count too much on my friendship in this matter i'm powerless  besides, i might lose the 10,000 francs you're not very subtle, but you are effective  i get the point yes, i have the letters but i intend using them myself i'm leaving casablanca on tonight's plane  the last plane and i'm taking a friend with me  one you'll appreciate - what friend? - ilsa lund that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape the last man i want to see in america you didn't come here to tell me this  you have the letters of transit you can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please why are you still interested in what happens to laszlo?i'm not  but i am interested in what happens to ilsa and me we have a legal right to go, that's true      but people have been held in casablanca in spite of their legal rights - what makes you think we want to hold you? - ilsa is laszlo's wife she probably knows things that strasser would like to know louis, i'll make a deal with you instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big      something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years   - be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it? - certainly germany-- vichy would be very grateful then release him you be at my place a half-hour before the plane leaves i'll have laszlo come there to pick up the letters      and that'll give you grounds to make the arrest you get him, and we get away to the germans, that last will be just a minor annoyance there's still something about this i don't quite understand miss lund, she is very beautiful, yes      but you were never interested in any woman - she isn't just any woman  - i see how do i know you'll keep your end of the bargain?i'll make the arrangements now with laszlo in the visitor's pen i'm gonna miss you  you're the only one in casablanca who has less scruples than i oh, thanks go ahead, ricky call off your watchdogs when you let him go  i don't want them around this afternoon i'm taking no chances, louis, not even with you should we draw up papers, or is a handshake good enough?certainly not good enough  but since i'm in a hurry, it'll have to do to get out of casablanca and go to america    you're a lucky man my agreement with sam is that he gets 25 percent of the profits  that still goes i happen to know he gets 10 percent  but he's worth 25 abdul, carl and sascha, they stay with the place or i don't sell of course  rick's wouldn't be rick's without them well, so long don't forget you owe rick's 100 cartons of american cigarettes i shall remember to pay it to myself - you're late  - i was informed when laszlo left the hotel      so i knew i'd be on time - i asked you to tie up your watchdogs  - he won't be followed here this place will never be the same without you i know what you mean  but i've spoken to ferrari  you'll still win at roulette - is everything ready? - i have the letters right here when we searched the place, where were they?sam's piano serves me right for not being musical here they are you better wait in my office victor thinks i'm leaving with him  haven't you told him?- not yet  - but you were able to arrange everything?everything is quite all right we'll tell him at the airport  the less time to think, the easier please trust me yes, i will - i don't know how to thank you  - save it  we've still lots of things to do - i brought the money  - keep it, you'll need it in america - but we made a deal  - never mind that - you won't have any trouble in lisbon? - no  it's all arranged good  i've got the letters here, made out in blank all you have to do is fill in the signatures victor laszlo victor laszlo, you're under arrest the charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom the letters were stolen you're surprised about my friend ricky? the explanation is simple love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue  thank--not so fast, louis  nobody is going to be arrested  not for a while yet - have you lost your mind? - i have  sit down - put that gun down  - i don't want to shoot you      but i will if you take one more step under the circumstances, i will sit down - keep your hands on the table  - i wonder if you realize what this means i do  we've got time to discuss that later call off your watchdogs, you said just the same, call the airport and let me hear you tell them and remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart that is my least vulnerable spot hello? is that the airport?this is captain renault speaking there'll be two letters of transit for the lisbon plane there's to be no trouble about them good hello?my car, quickly!this is major strasser have a squad of police meet me at the airport at once at once, do you hear?hello, radio tower?lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway visibility, 1 1/2 miles light ground fog  depth of fog approximately 500 ceiling unlimited  thank you have your man go with laszlo and take care of his luggage certainly, rick, anything you say - find laszlo's luggage  put it on the plane  - yes, sir this way, please if you don't mind, fill in the names  that'll make it more official you think of everything, don't you?and the names are mr  and mrs  victor laszlo - but why my name, richard? - because you're getting on that plane i don't understand  what about you?i'm staying with him till the plane gets away no  what has happened? last night you said--last night we said a great many things you said i was to do the thinking for us i've done a lot of it since then  it adds up to one thing:you're getting on that plane with victor where you belong now, you've got to listen to me any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here?chances are we'd both wind up in a concentration camp  true, louis?i'm afraid major strasser would insist - you're saying this only to make me go  - i'm saying it because it's true inside of us we both know you belong with victor you're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going if that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life but what about us?we'll always have paris we didn't have-- we'd lost it until you came to casablanca we got it back last night - when i said i would never leave you  - and you never will but i've got a job to do too where i'm going, you can't follow  what i've got to do you can't be any part of ilsa, i'm no good at being noble but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people      don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world someday you'll understand that now, now here's looking at you, kid - everything is in order  - all except one thing there's something you should know i don't ask you to explain anything i'm going to anyway  it may make a difference to you later on you said you knew about ilsa and me you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were she came there for the letters of transit  isn't that true, ilsa?yes she tried everything to get them  nothing worked she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago for your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and i let her pretend i understand - here it is  - thanks i appreciate it welcome back to the fight this time i know our side will win are you ready, ilsa?yes, i'm ready goodbye, rick god bless you you better hurry  you'll miss that plane i was right  you are a sentimentalist stay where you are  i don't know what you're talking about what you just did for laszlo that fairy tale you invented to send ilsa away with him i know a little about women, my friend  she went but she knew you were lying anyway, thanks for helping me out i suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us  especially for you - i'll have to arrest you, of course  - as soon as the plane goes, louis - what was the meaning of that phone call? - victor laszlo is on that plane why do you stand here? why don't you stop him?ask monsieur rick - get away from that phone  - i advise you not to interfere i was willing to shoot captain renault, and i'm willing to

become a patriot maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start i think perhaps you're right it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while there's a free french garrison over at brazzaville - i could be induced to arrange a passage  - my letter of transit?i could use a trip but it doesn't change our bet  you still owe me 10,000 francs that 10,000 francs should pay our

real kick in the ass but, robby here has known stewartlonger than most of you have been alive,so, i'll hand it off to him  robby oh, well, thanks, ben  i think although i take issue with your reference to my seniority,i will say that stewart's departure is especially painful for mebecause, uh    for what, stewart?twenty years now?stewart's been more than willing to partwith his money at the poker table and i've got a kid in college yeah, but i'm gonna keep playing  oh, problem solved godspeed then now, stewart, i find the timing of your departuredisconcerting the corner office sits empty,the new editor arrives on monday,so i'm sorry, buddy, but i gotta ask ya what the hell do you know?how's the cake?it's really good  are you saving yours?nah, it's for mike  i can never eat at those things they kind of depress me  i know did you see the numbers from washington?yeah  very interesting  i think so, too i'm not asking if the pd's lying, i know they're lying all i'm asking, who's behind it?oh  okay, i get it  you don't want to talk no, dan, i'm not mad, i'm hungry i've been talking here so long i didn't eat lunch so i'm gonna go get something to eat,and that'll give you an hour to decidewhether you want to be on the right side of thisor read about it like everybody else bye, dan you think cahill has something?maybe  i just don't think the story's for us ben likes it  yeah, it's not bad, it's just not spotlight what's just not spotlight?the pd numbers  the numbers story  it feels thin oh, you got cahill to talk?no, but i will good  then we'll know if it's thin - how'd it go upstairs? - oh, okay - robby gave a good speech  - sure he did i heard lubin and connor are going to the <i>times </i>- come on, really? - yeah, i heard that they're leeching us well, at least they're sending us a guy from miami to run things that should help has baron even spent time in boston?i don't think he's ever been here before  maybe we should buy him a map i have a friend down in miami said he cut 15% of the staff great    hey, robby new boss coming in to make some cuts?i have no idea aren't you sitting down with him?yes, i am  so is it about spotlight?i don't know, mike, but i do knowthat ben needs an answer on the crime numbers story i'm telling you, i really don't think that story's for us mr  baron walter robinson  robby thanks for taking the time out of your weekend oh, my pleasure  appreciate it what are you reading?uh   <i>the curse of the bambino </i>oh, yeah, it's a great book the <i>globe</i> has season tickets at fenwayonce you're settled in, by the way thank you uh, to be honest, i'm not much of a baseball fan i'm just trying to get a feel for the city oh, yeah   so you're originally from boston?i am  born and raised, yeah a lot of the newsroom is from here it really feels like a local paper in that way and did that change at all after the paper was sold to the <i>times?</i>no  no, i don't think that had a big impact good and you're an editor for the spotlight team?i'd prefer to think of myself as player coach  but yes are you familiar with spotlight?no, not particularly well, we are a four-person investigative team we report to ben bradlee, jr ,and we keep our work confidential what're you working on now?we just put out a piece on a shoddy construction outfit,and right now we're really just trolling around for our next story how long does that typically take?hard to say  a couple months couple months?yeah, we don't like to rush it once we settle on a project, we can spend a year or more investigating it is that a concern? not necessarily um, but from what i understand readership is down,internet is cutting into the classified business, andi think i'm gonna need to take a hard look at things so, do you anticipate more cuts?i think it's safe to assume so,but what i'm more focused on right now is finding a wayto make this paper essential to its readers i like to think it already is fair enough  i just think that we can do better mr  bradlee  hey saw the pd numbers  looks interesting yeah, there's something there how long do you need? another week where're you going? 10:30 since when?technically, i am an editor technically your sit-down with baron go that well?i couldn't get a read on him  that's a first how about you? oh, he's a barrel of laughs morning, everyone  let's get started do you wanna say something, marty?uh, sure uh, hello as most of you know by now, my name is marty baron,i'm delighted to be here um, if you could tell me your name as we go around, that'd be helpful thank you okay  peter?peter canellos, metro i've got a major big dig closure hey, steve  hey  mike crappy game last night, huh?yeah, they can't hit worth a nickel hey listen, what's eileen mcnamara doing in the 10:30?do you need something, mike? no, just curious go be curious somewhere else  i got work to do, huh?okay, steve see you  yeah and it looks like pedro's gonna be out until september 1st jimmy says he'll be back this year, but the doc didn't seem so sure when's the pats' opener?is that everyone?yes, that's it  okay  good thank you  uh   did everyone read eileen mcnamara's column this weekend?that's the geoghan case?yeah, what's the folo on that?it's a column, what kind of folo were you thinking?uh, well, apparently this priest molested kidsin six different parishes over the last 30 years,and the attorney for the victims, mr   garabedian  thanks, eileen mr  garabedian says cardinal law found outabout it 15 years ago and did nothing yeah, i think that attorney's a bit of a crank,and the church dismissed the claim he said, she said whether mr  garabedian is a crank or nothe says he has documents that prove the cardinal knew as i understand it, those documents are under seal okay, but the fact remains, a boston priest abused 80 kids,we have a lawyer who says he can prove law knew about it,and we've written all of, uh, two stories in the last six months this strikes me as an essential story to a local paper i think at the very least, we have to go through those documents how would you like to do that?oh, uh   i don't know what the laws are here,but in florida we would go to court you want to sue the church?technically we wouldn't sue the church we'd file a motion to lift the seal on those documents the church will read that as us suing them so will everybody else good to know gutsy call for the first day that's one word for it how do you think that's gonna play down front?i think gilman's gonna shit a brick hey  door how'd it go?well, baron wants to sue for the sealed docs in the geoghan case wants to sue the church? hey, that's great we covered geoghan when the story broke three years ago baron was still in miami i think he might have been at the <i>times</i> then, actually he wasn't here so do you think that suit has a chance?depends on the judge and what parish he belongs to bradlee  yeah okay baron wants to talk to us us?okay, jon  thank you yes  okay, thanks i've set up a meeting for tomorrow with outside counsel jon albano? yeah who's the judge in this case?um   constance sweeney tough  why's that?good catholic girl  huh so, um,judging from what i've read, it doesn't seem like we've donea very thorough investigation into the geoghan case is that right? no, it's not we looked hard at geoghan david armstrong from metro, michael paulson for religion okay, but, uh, just so i understand,beyond our daily coverage, we haven't   we haven't committed any long-term investigative resourcesto the question of whether or not cardinal law knew about this?no, we haven't and that's the kind of thing your team would do?spotlight? well, yeah but we're still prospecting the boston pd story i told you about could you set that aside?we could marty, in past spotlight's had success in large partbecause they pick their own projects would you consider picking this one?i don't know if he's writing about you,but i will let him know you called okay, bye hey  hey, how'd it go?okay  uh   baron wants us to scrub the geoghan case that's great  didn't we cover geoghan?yeah, there's a lawyer alleging cardinal law knew about it - mmm  mitch garabedian, right? - yeah i covered him at the courthouse can you get to him? i only interviewed him once he's kind of a character i like characters  i'll take him good  you take him also, we should be talking to, uh,the lawyer who repped the victims in the porter case eric macleish  uh-huh that guy was always on tv  yeah, the porter case?remind me  yeah, um, father porter, similar story molested dozens of kids in fall river about 10 years ago so, we're dropping the boston pd?i vote yes  no, no we just gotta set it aside for now listen, i don't need to tell you guys this we need to be more discreet than usual all right?everybody's gonna be interested in this, not just the <i>herald </i>we can't let cardinal law get wind of this until we know what we have good luck with that <i>so when do you leave, nana?</i>the bus is picking us up in the church parking lot at 9:00 we have 40 people going and is father dominic going?no, he says he's unlucky but luck has nothing to do with it you know, last time nana won $160  wow you gonna tell her?we don't even know if there's a story yet well, <i>\"globe</i> sues church\"? it's gonna be a story hey, lisa  could you pull all the relevant clips on that for me?yeah is this for spotlight?just drop them off when they're ready? thanks excuse me, do you know where the publisher's office is?will do how are you, marty?settling in?yeah, i think so  good what can i do for you?um   i'd like to challenge the protective order in the geoghan case you want to sue the catholic church?um   we're just filing a motion, but   yes you think it's that important?yes, i do because obviously the church will fight us very hard on this which won't go unnoticed by our subscriber base 53% of them are catholic mmm-hmm i think they'll be interested okay marty, lake street will probably contact youabout a face-to-face with the cardinal it's customary yeah  they already have  it's set up for next week i wouldn't mention this hello?hello?can i help you? oh, hi i'm mike rezendes from <i>the boston globe </i>i'm here to see mitchell garabedian he's on a call  please have a seat okay all right, i'm listening  go ahead okay bill! where the hell are those papers?i asked you to put 'em on my desk!the famous walter robinson in my conference room good to see you again, eric sacha pfeiffer, eric macleish nice to meet you  nice to meet you you don't play golf, do you?uh, no  good your colleague here took some money off meat a charity event last year it was a very lucky putt  i actually had my eyes closed, by the way mmm-hmm so, how can i help you guys?uh   you're familiar with the geoghan case?sure eighty plaintiffs  all of them individual cases garabedian must be swimming well  and the allegations against cardinal law?yeah, it's tricky  um   this is what you need to understand  these are shitty cases the statute of limitations is only three years,and most of these victims don't come forward until long after that oh  why is that?well, they're kids, you know guilt, shame and most of these kids come from tough neighborhoods nobody wants to admit this kind of thing so, you're screwed on the time limit and, uh,even if you argue your way around thatthe charitable immunity statute caps damages at 20 grand twenty grand for molesting a child?that is the way the system is set up  yes the church is tough so, your best shot is to try these casesin the press like i did on porter hmm  but, you know, most of the victims,they don't wanna have anything to do with tv and, uh,mitch isn't exactly a people person yeah, and if garabedian can't get his victimsto go before the press, then he's really   that's right  he has a long road ahead of him my guess is he doesn't have anything on law what? you think he's bluffing or   i think he's grandstanding to cut a better deal seems a bit reckless have you met mitch garabedian?i asked you to write up that motion, bill  i didn't ask you to file it hey, bill, here's the case files from yesterday hi who are you? i'm mike rezendes from <i>the boston globe </i>i had an appointment with you about an hour ago i can't talk to you  i'm very busy  sharon!no, no  she went out for coffee  she said she'd be right back i'm following up on an article the one in the <i>phoenix?</i> no  in the <i>globe </i>did you see the one in the <i>phoenix?</i>no, i didn't  i thought it was very good i have a copy here somewhere that's all right  i'll track it down i'm actually following up on a columnthat eileen mcnamara wrote about your suit suits  there are 84 of them it's not a class action you should get your facts straight  no, you're right  i should so i'm trying to get some background information on   you're not recording this, are you?no, i wouldn't do that without asking i can't show you those church's documents if that's what you're after they're under seal yeah, i know that did you know that they tried to bring me upbefore the massachusetts board of bar overseers three times?they're watching me very closely the church? yeah  the church  yeah they'd like to get me disbarred  in fact, put that away put it away  sure i don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form not on paper, not on tape, nothing in fact, i probably shouldn't even be speaking to you  so   look, mr  garabedian,i know there's things you cannot tell me,but i also know there's a story here and i think it's an important story i already talked to the <i>phoenix </i>yeah, and there's a reason i didn't see it nobody reads the <i>phoenix</i> anymore they're broke  they don't have any power the <i>globe</i> does if we cover this story, everybody will hear about it the church thinks in centuries, mr  rezendes do you think your paper has the resources to take that on?yeah, i do but if you don't mind me asking,do you?i can't talk to you right now, mr  rezendes, i'm very, very busy sharon? yeah  thank you can i at least talk to some of your clients? the victims?i'd really like to do that call me tomorrow, i gotta think about it  thank you thanks  yeah, yeah i got more clips from the library leave 'em right there are you guys doing a story on the church?no, we are not doing a story on the church matt, you find anything on this guy, phil saviano?no  who is he?he's part of a victims' organization kurkjian did a story on him right after the porter case there's a victims' organization?yeah, it's called snap it's survivors network of those abused by priests - crummy acronym  - hmm you want me to track him down? yeah  bring him in how much longer you need to get through the clips?i mean, a few days  there's a lot lisa's still sending up more  okay hey, guys  i think i got another priest liam barrett  molested some kids in phillyand was moved to boston did the same thing and was moved again really? that sounds like geoghan is that one of our clips?yeah  byline's diego ribadeneira, 1997 must've been back when he was working religion was there any folo? not much  one short piece huh  the church settled the case don't you know jim sullivan?yeah  why?looks like the church brought him in to help out jesus   has anybody but manny gotten the ball out of the infield?nope  why do you even bother with that thing?it distracts me from the game know what else is good for that?oh, yeah  good idea  my round  i'll be right back anybody want any food? no i'm all set  hey, a hot dog so you guys making any progress?absolutely  it's a good story  why?because you're another lapsed catholic pissed off at the church?we've got a lot of good stuff  like what?i'm just watching the game  omert\u00e3\u00a0 they got another priest, liam barrett we reported on him i'm just saying, we did  okay,but this guy was shuffled around from parish to parish every few years,just like geoghan and porter i think there's a pattern sounds thin  what else you got?sacha's got another guy from a victims' organization, phil saviano from snap? oh, boy  we reported on him, too i thought you were watching the game, steve that guy's pretty banged up, mike we did a couple stories on him that guy would not stop writing letters he wants a holy war what? so he's not worth talking to?where are you on garabedian?i'm working on it robby said macleish thinks he's bluffing i think there's something there, ben get me something solid, or i'm taking you off it i don't want us chasing our tails on this stay away from that trap you couldn't reach that trap in a million years, partner i've reached that trap before yeah? now paul, maybe - how we doing? - we're good we're two up in the front good how's that new editor working out?well, he doesn't like baseball but he seems like a smart guy yeah, i read an article about him said he's the first jewish editor at the <i>globe </i>must have been a slow news day he got a family, this guy?no  he is not married divorced? i don't think so, no so the new editor of the <i>globe</i> is an unmarried man of the jewish faithwho hates baseball?yeah  should have given it to ben he's a bradlee, for crying out loud didn't raise his hand fast enough, i guess hey, by the way,i've been reading about this priest, father barrett said you were involved with that barrett, yeah  bad egg lake street asked for help, i pitched in victims said cardinal law knew about barrett when he came from philly is that true?you know i can't talk about the case, robby off the record?off the record i can't talk about it all right  this related to the lawsuit?you know about that?look,i don't know this guy baron or what his agenda is frankly, i don't care i just don't want to see you taking a bullet for him i think you're away put it over here  let's go  let's go <i>so the other day i was on the world wide web </i><i>anything you want to know  it's right there </i>now, i have to admit that as a priest,this makes me a little nervous should i be worried about job security?i don't think so <i>you see, knowledge is one thing,</i><i>but faith   </i><i>faith is another </i>hey hey shouldn't you be golfing or something?golfing's not a verb and i couldn't get a tee time is that what they call it? \"tee time\"?they also call it \"a leisure activity \" you ought to try it, mike i do  i run  yeah, you run to work so why are you here today?going over these clips of saviano yep, ben and steve think it's a dead end they gave me a bunch of crap about it at the game yeah, ben emailed me he did? yeah he said we should let it go what do you wanna do?i wanna bring saviano in so, just ignore those guys?i think we've got to start ignoring everybody on this one i'm good with that mmm do you think marty has any idea what's coming down the pike?nope  i don't think he cares either that's refreshing yeah unless he's wrong <i>i've always been fascinated with the newspaper business </i>i used to sit in on the lectures with the nieman fellowswhen i was at harvard i read that you were an editor once oh, yes yeah, that was a very long time ago the <i>mississippi register </i>small, diocesan newspaper but for a 30-year-old pastor, it was a big responsibility too much at times how so?i was close with the evers brothers we took a stand on civil rights our readership was not pleased they saw me as a meddling outsider i can imagine tough seat to sit in,especially in a small town i think you'll find that boston's still a small town, too, marty,in many ways but if i can be of any help, marty, don't hesitate to ask i find that the city flourisheswhen its great institutions work together thank you personally i'm of the opinion that for a paper to best perform its function,it really needs to stand alone ah  of course but my offer still stands thank you come in ah!thank you, maureen a little gift, marty think of it as a cardinal's guide to the city of boston i'm here to see sacha pfeiffer your name? phil saviano okay, just a minute so am i the first survivor you've talked to?yeah, phil  you are okay, well   first of all, let me say thank you for having me in today and i want you to knowthat you have the full cooperation of my organization, snap how many members are in your organization, phil?we had 11 at our last chapter meeting   uh, no, 10  karen just moved you had a woman in your group?of course there was a woman  they don't discriminate,not when it comes to abuse and this has nothing to do with being gay what this is, is priests using the collar to rape kids kids  boys and girls i was 11,and i was preyed upon by father david holley in worcester and i don't mean prayed for  i mean preyed upon are any of you catholic?i was raised catholic  now i go to my wife's presbyterian church i'm lapsed i go to church with my grandmother sometimes it's safe to say we were all raised catholic, but now   not so much okay  well, let me tell you when you're a poor kid from a poor family, religion counts for a lot and when a priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal he asks you to collect the hymnalsor take out the trash, you feel special it's like god asking for help so maybe it's a little weird when he tells you a dirty joke,but now you got a secret together, so you go along then he shows you a porno mag, and you go along and you go along, and you go along,until one day he asks you to jerk him off or give him a blow job and so you go along with that, too,because you feel trapped,because he has groomed you how do you say no to god, right?see,it is important to understand that this is not just physical abuse,it's spiritual abuse, too and when a priest does this to you, he robs you of your faith so you reach for the bottle or the needle or if those don't work, you jump off a bridge that's why we call ourselves survivors have you read jason berry's book?he wrote about the gauthe case in louisiana?uh, that's \"g\"    g-a-u-t-h-e here  and talk to richard sipe he worked in one of the church's treatment centers he's an ex-priest,married a nun here this is his testimony from the kos case uh, phil, what's a treatment center?it's where they send priests when they get caught this is all right here in the box,i sent this all to you guys five years ago uh, to the <i>globe?</i> who did you send it to?i don't wanna say who, but they said that they weren't interested uh, but phil, we did run a couple of stories on you i saw them in the clips yeah, but to be completely frank, it wasn't enough you guys gotta understand,this is big this is not just boston  it's the whole country  it's the whole world and it goes right up to the vatican do you have any proof of that, phil?no, not yet  but think about it, there are so many of them how else could they have hidden it for so long?so many what? priests!priests!i know of 13 right here in boston you know 13 priests in boston who have molested children?yeah, why do you keep repeating everything i say?i just like to clarify things maybe you should have clarified it five years agowhen i sent you all of this stuff!it's all right here!may i use your bathroom?yeah, sure, phil come on well, what do you think?well, the guy, he's got an agenda, that's for sure you think? he's obviously been through a lot but he's smart, and if he's right about 13 priests   yeah, it might be a big \"if\" with this guy do a background check on him,and follow up with some of the other survivors of his group i'll track down this ex-priest, sipe okay, but stay on garabedian  that's more important garabedian, what a pain in the ass you can be a pain in the ass, mike mmm mitchell, what a surprise  how are you?i'm fine, mr  rezendes  good you know, i haven't heard back from you  i left you a couple of messages i know  i've been very busy  i don't have time for calls oh, jeez, i'm sure you don't listen, listen, mitch, let me talk to a couple of the victims you could sit in on the interview,and if you're not happy, you could kill it i spoke to my clients, and they don't want to be in the press  i'm sorry i get that, but i don't need to name names i don't believe you, mr  rezendes  i'm sure you don't i don't  listen, mitchell look, mr  rezendes, please   i'm not writing a profile here i'm working on something bigger  bigger?i don't know what that means i'm not supposed to tell you this,but i'm digging around for spotlight spotlight's on this? yeah, we're looking into it,but you gotta help me you gotta let me talk to some of these victims, please please come back tomorrow  9:30 a m thank you ms  pfeiffer? joe?hi  oh, shoot oh, that's okay  sorry no, no problem  please sit thank you is this table okay?this is perfect i had a muffin while i was waiting two, actually i eat when i'm nervous  i do that, too, actually i hope i'm not late  phil told me 1:00 no, you're fine  i got here early about an hour um, would you mind if i took some notes? would that be all right?you don't mind if i take some notes, do you?- are you going to use my name? - no not if you don't want me to  no i just had a kid he's only one, but i'm not sure i want him to know about this sure  i get that you can stop this interview at any time, patrick all right? okay go ahead with your notes okay  so, um   where'd you live when it first happened?in the projects, over in hyde park over by the stop & shop?yeah, you know it?yeah, i drove a cab for a few years open early  bad coffee, right?yeah, i guess how old were you when it happened?i was 12 just after my dad killed himself ah, jeez he was a real piece of shit and my mom, she wasn't so stable either how do you mean? i mean, she was nuts she was a schizophrenic  same shit when did you first meet geoghan?well, my sister,she saw him over in the dunkin' donuts tells him about my old man passing, and he rushed right over and there was this nun, sister barbara,and she ran this group for kids from troubled families mmm-hmm where was that?st  ambrose in dorchester  okay she's the one who introduced me to father shanley he was a street priest long hair  very hip he invited me to his apartment in back bay where in back bay? beacon street beacon  okay are you from here?uh, no  i grew up in ohio, but my mom's from southie okay, so you get it  i'd never even seen back bay so what happened on that first visit, joe?well, he was very nice at first,very funny, very casual and i think he could tell i was gay,so he showed me this mobile he had, like, over a baby's crib?mmm-hmm but with different words \"homosexual, transsexual, bisexual \"okay, and did you know you were gay at that time, joe?yeah but that wasn't information i was sharing with anybody not in dorchester okay so, what happened after he showed you the mobile?well, i was a little freaked out mmm-hmm i think he could tell,so he said, \"you know what'll help is if we play strip poker \"course i lost and, uh, things went on from there can you tell me specifically what happened?specifically, he   he molested me joe, i think that the language is going to be so important here we can't sanitize this  just saying \"molest\" isn't enough people need to know what actually happened we should probably get these to go  right geoghan shows up, and my mom, you know, she's   she's thrilled  i mean   this was like god showing up, you know?sure  right so what happened then?you really want to hear this shit?yeah  yeah, patrick, i do he offers to take me to get ice cream and, you know, he's a priest  i'm a kid, so i go sure  so we're driving home and he   he starts patting my leg,you know, thenhis hand just slides right up, and he grabs my dick you know, i just froze up  i was fucking petrified, i couldn't move i didn't know what to do  i was just a little kid yeah you know, i never even touched my ice cream it just melted down my arm did you, um   did you see him again after that?yeah all right  that's good  let's stop there for now sure he said it was a way to make me more comfortable with my body mmm so what happened after that?well, he took off his clothes, and he said,\"i've been so depressed,\"but maybe you can cheer me up and give me a blow job \"classy guy and did you? yeah i know what you must be thinking, like, why would i ever do thatto some creepy guy who's 30 years older than me, but   what you have to understand is that this is the first time in my lifethat someone told me that it was okay to be gay  mmm-hmm and it was a priest  right so you had oral sex  did you have intercourse?yes not then, but later it really messed me up i'm sober now, but that    that was the beginning of it all it's very confusing, you know,to be introduced to sex like that and then   and then to be attracted to men, it's   i'm sorry  i knew i was gonna do this oh, i'm sorry  don't be sorry it's okay, joe  it's okay of course there is a church right there and a playground joe, did you ever try and tell anyone?like who? a priest?can i use your phone?yeah, sure  you know where it is you can use my name if you want thanks, patrick don't thank me, just get these assholes, will you?he's one of the lucky ones he's still alive do you want a cup of tea, sacha?i'm okay, nana  thanks  okay <i>hello </i> hi, joe, it's sacha pfeiffer <i>hi, sacha  how are you?</i> i'm good, thanks listen, joe, i just wanted to follow up on one thing you talked to phil saviano about all of this, right?<i>yeah, i did  i went to a couple of snap meetings </i>and did phil ever suggest you do anything about it?<i>no </i><i>the meetings weren't really about that </i><i>i mean, a couple of them had gone to a lawyer,</i><i>but i didn't think it was worth it </i>why not?<i>there were just so many forms to fill out </i><i>it was overwhelming, you know </i><i>and he said it could only get me a small settlement, so   </i>who, who said that? <i>the lawyer told me that </i>so you did go and see a lawyer?<i>yeah, but i didn't end up using him,</i><i>so i didn't think it was important </i><i>i'm sorry  i'm not trying to hide anything </i>no, i know, joe do remember his name? the lawyer?<i>no, but maybe phil would know </i><i>the guy was on tv a lot during the porter case </i><i>he was handsome </i>was it eric macleish?<i>yeah, that's it  macleish </i><i>i thought he was very handsome </i>hey  hey i was just in the newsroom  judge sweeney set a date for the hearing really? when?two weeks, in springfield canellos started a pool  ten bucks to get in anyone picking the <i>globe?</i>he's only taking bets on how fast sweeney rules against us - robby  <i>- hi, it's me </i><i>did you get my message?</i> i did looks like father shanley could be our fourth priest <i>yeah, i think he is </i>did you follow up with macleish?<i>i just talked to phil </i><i>he said macleish dealt with a number of these cases </i><i>guess he forgot to mention that </i> yeah i'm gonna go to the courthouse tomorrow,see if i can find any cases he settled against the church <i>all right  call me after you do  good night </i>okay, good night hey you wanted to chat?yeah, i'm late for a dinner  you wanna walk me out?sure jeez does this guy ever go home? apparently not i got guys who won't leave till he does he's wearing out the goddamn newsroom where are we on geoghan?following up on more victims hey, i want to expand the investigation why? we got a fourth priest there might be as many as 13 thirteen? yeah who's your source? phil saviano oh, jesus christ, robby, i told mike    i know, i know   i think saviano might be legit, ben you wanna elaborate on that?no  not really it just feels like this thing's stacking up  it's my gut okay  okay  good thank you hello?<i>mr  rezendes?</i> uh, yeah  who's this?<i>it's richard sipe </i>oh, yeah  hey, richard, how are you? <i>i'm good </i>uh, thanks for calling  look   phil saviano gave me your name i was wondering if i can ask you a few questions <i>of course  yeah </i> great so, phil told me that you were workingat one of the church's treatment centers in baltimore?<i>yes  the seton psychiatric institute </i><i>it was run by the daughters of charity </i>and, uh, when was that, richard?<i>well, i started my psychotherapy fellowship there in 1965,</i><i>and i was there for five years,</i><i>but i spent the next 30 studying abusive priests and their victims </i>really? <i>mmm-hmm </i>and that's been your sole focus?<i>look, mike,</i><i>the church wants us to believe that it's just a few bad apples </i><i>but it's a much bigger problem than that </i>how much bigger, richard?<i>well, based on the research,</i><i>i would classify it as a recognizable psychiatric phenomenon </i>that's big hey, mac  hey if i wanted historical data on a priest,parishes he'd been assigned to,where would i find that?the geoghan case? it's all in the clips  lisa has the source material yeah, what if it was for another priest?one that hadn't been in the papers you're looking at another priest? who're you looking at?any ideas?oh, come on, matt, you're not going to tell me?i gotta get to a meeting  thanks, mac hey, steve the archdiocese puts out an annual directory every priest and parish  that's great do these go back any further than '98?oh, yeah  going back to the '80s in the mez beyond that you gotta go to the bpl in the mez, huh? thanks, lisa  you bet he said they all target the same kind of kid low-income families, absentee fathers, broken homes so a guy like geoghan goes after boys not because he prefers them,but because they have more shame less likely to talk these guys are predators, robby and i talked to sipe  he said he'd seen dozens of themin the '60s in seton he called it a \"phenomenon \"why didn't he go public? he did,but the church made a huge effort to discredit him smear campaigns, public statements by prominent bishops it's just like saviano said, and garabedian you getting anywhere with him?more victims  more victims you can't empty his pockets? i'll get to him i just need more time  oh, come on, mike you gotta get him  i'll get him, i'll get him jesus  what the hell is that smell?there's a dead rat in the corner what have you got? church directories it's every priest in massachusetts what parish they're assigned to are these official? yeah i figured it could help us track downsome of the priests that saviano mentioned maybe find some more victims can we turn on some more lights? i couldn't find the switch you wanna borrow my glasses? no, i'm good  i'm good look, 1983  john geoghan, st  brendan parish, dorchester so we can find out where any priest is in any given year?yeah, i got him here at   huh what?1980, the year geoghan was pulled from jp  it says he's on sick leave come on  it really says that?where is, uh, 1991?here ya go  let me see this barrett  barrett  liam i can't read that  look for a liam barrett in there 1991's the year they pulled him out of charlestown barrett, liam yeah  \"sick leave \"it's an official designation let's get these upstairs and, matt, check on those priests saviano gave us - robby  yeah  <i>- hey, i'm down at the courthouse </i>something's not right here  nothing on shanley either, sacha okay, thanks yeah, we need to go talk to macleish again <i>really, why?</i> huh? there's nothing here there aren't any records, i checked every name thanks for waiting  so sorry, guys  stuck on a call not a problem  how are you? good thanks for meeting us  you bet  what's up, guys?mr  macleish, are you familiar with a priest named paul shanley?yes, i am familiar with him and have you settled cases against father shanley?as i'm sure you can understand, i can't discuss that with you how about, uh, father ronald paquin?well, i can't discuss that with you either  come on, guys we understand you've settled several cases against each of them even if i'd been involved in those cases,the settlements would be confidential,and i could be disbarred for acknowledging their existence okay? mmm-hmm look, i told you guys, these are tough cases most of these folks, they just want some acknowledgmentof what happened we got 'em a sit-down with the bishop and a little dough,and that's the best they could hope for well, it's certainly the best the priests could hope for no, the church promised they'd take the priests out of circulation and did you follow up on that?do you guys need anything else?yes  why aren't there any records?i was down at the courthouse earlier there aren't any records of any of these settlements we dealt directly with the church we would draw up a demand letter and send it to the chancery you never filed anything in court?it's a private mediation so, this is just you and the archdiocese's lawyersin a room?correct anyone else?occasionally, the church would bring in another defense attorney to help out you have names?nope no, i don't so this was all under the table?there's no paper trail  at all the victim has to sign a confidentiality agreementto get the settlement the lawyer takes a third and the church sweeps it under the rug jeez, it's a freakin' racket it's more complicated than that macleish's got a duty to the client to get the best deal he can sure, but how many victims do you represent and profit frombefore you say something?garabedian would say none that's why he's taking these cases to courtbecause he wants people to know about this i agree  and legal ethics aside, ben,i mean, operating the way macleish hasall but guarantees that the abuse stays under wraps yeah  did macleish confirm all saviano's priests?no  he's limited by his confidentiality agreement but clearly he's settled cases against a number of them phil's put me in touch with some of the other victims,i'm pretty confident all of his priests are gonna check out so it is 13 priests?yeah  looks that way holy shit okay  keep going i'm sorry  what was the name again?uh, baron b-a-r-o-n i'm having trouble finding it  just give me a second it's okay, kim, i can vouch for him i'm pete conley, i'm on the board of catholic charities welcome to boston, mr  baron thank you  i appreciate you joining us we're very proud of the work we do here at boston oh, the cardinal said you had a nice visit yes, we did he's an extraordinary man  i'm glad you had a chance to chat enjoying yourself?uh, to be honest, these events aren't really my strong suit yeah  are you involved with the charity?not directly, no  several of my friends are we all went to high school  bc high that's the school across the street from the <i>globe </i>it's hard to miss  yeah hard to get away from, too, apparently the cardinal's in the corner if you're so inclined we've met  really?did he mention the suit?no, but he did give me a copy of the catechism yeah, well, the cardinal's not known for his subtlety during the porter investigation,he'd literally called down the power of god on the <i>globe </i>how'd that play out?a week later our editor broke his leg skiing shrimp toast, gentlemen?no, thanks  no you said one of the victims filed a criminal complaint?yeah, there were a few of them but the judge had the case records sealedafter friends of the church complained and the church has a lot of friends like eric macleish?yeah let's just say he's not part of the solution you follow what i'm saying? sure you work hard, mr  rezendes are you married? yeah your wife doesn't mind you working all the time?oh, yeah, she does that's why i never got married  i'm too busy what i do is too important hmm your new editor, he's a jew right?oh, that's right, yeah  yeah, see,he comes in and suddenly everybody's interested in the church you know why?because it takes an outsider, like me i'm armenian how many armenians do you know in boston?steve kurkjian, works at the <i>globe </i>oh, that's two  you should get a prize or something what are you, italian? no, i'm portuguese from where? east boston really? east boston?you don't sound like it this city, these people,making the rest of us feel like we don't belong but they're no better than us look at how they treat their children mark my words, mr  rezendes,if it takes a village to raise a child,it takes a village to abuse one hey, here he is  want a beer? love one another  you here with barbara?no, she hates these things  karen, too yeah  smart ladies <i>sl\u00e3\u00a1inte </i>mmm i met your new editor seemed like a decent fellow  i think he is hey, i had an interesting conversation with eric macleish the other day turns out he's been settling abuse cases with the archdiocese for years you really wanna talk about this here?jim, you said you helped out on father barrett as a favor that was a one-off?how many of these cases have you been involved with?you know i can't answer that, robby  it's unethical is that all it is?so, this would be the robby robinsoni've always heard about but never met listen to me, jimmy you wanna be on the right side of this this is the church you're talking about, robby look around  these are good people,done a lot of good for this city enjoy the party i've been through a lot of these now \"sick leave\" isn't the only designation they usewhen they take one of these priests out of circulation they use a slew of terms  \"absent on leave,\"\"unassigned,\" \"emergency response \"they got a word for everything, these guys  hmm  except \"rape \"and they move parishes way more frequently than other priests when i was a kid, a priest movedafter seven or eight years, sometimes longer these guys, it's two to three years tops and did they use these designations for all of saviano's priests?yeah, it's a pretty clear pattern guys, i got sipe <i>i think if you really want to understand the crisis,</i><i>you need to start with the celibacy requirement </i><i>that was my first major finding </i><i>only 50% of the clergy are celibate </i><i>now, most of them are having sex with other adults </i><i>but the fact remains that this creates a culture of secrecy</i><i>that tolerates and even protects pedophiles </i>so you believe the church is aware of the extent of this crisis?<i>oh, absolutely  after the first major scandal in louisiana,</i><i>tom doyle, the secretary-canonist for the papal nuncio,</i><i>co-authored a report warning pedophile priests</i><i>were a billion-dollar liability </i><i>that was in 1985 </i>1985? <i>that's right </i>who saw that report? anyone from the catholic hierarchy?<i>sure </i><i>doyle tried to introduce the report at</i><i>the national conference of catholic bishops </i><i>in fact, cardinal law initially helped to fund the report </i><i>but then he backed out, and they shelved it </i>are you kidding me?richard, robby here we think we have 13 priests in boston that fit this pattern,which would be a very, very big story does that sound right to you in terms of scale?<i>no, not really, robby  it sounds low to me </i><i>my estimates suggest 6% act out sexually with minors </i>uh, 6% of what?<i>6% of all priests </i>how many priests do we have in boston?about 1,500  1% is 15 6% is90 all right, 90 priests  is that possible?<i>from a metric standpoint,</i><i>yes, that would certainly be in line with my findings </i><i>hello?</i>uh   ninety fucking priests? in boston?that's what he said if there were 90 of these bastards, people would know maybe they do and no one said a thing?good germans?i don't think that's a comparison you want to make publically macleish knew  he just didn't say anything that's 13 priests there's a big difference between 13 and 90 where's this guy sipe getting his numbers?well, he's been studying it for 30 years he is a trained psychotherapist okay, but we need something more than a metricfrom some hippy ex-priest who's shacking up with a nun okay, so we'll track down more victims  we'll get more priests then we can check them against the directories that's a shitload of victims we'll get there how long's it gonna take?too long wait, but    meeting's over?yeah, for now look, what've you got? what if we work backwards?what do you mean? from what? from the directories we've been using them to confirm bad priests what if we do it the other way around?use the directories to identify bad priests  yeah, exactly we search by designation we look for any priest on \"sick leave\" or \"unassigned \"or have been moved around a lot  yeah it's gonna take a load of work well, not if we're all on it you, too?generally that's what \"all\" means  yeah  yeah, generally library is closing library is closing holy shit no freakin' way - talbot  - yeah - tivnan  - yeah toma  yeah turnbull  yeah walsh  yeah welsh  yeah that's it  that's it holy shit  robby?that's three off sipe's estimate  that's incredible robby?how many? eighty-seven eighty-seven priests in boston call macleish  i wanna talk to him  okay can you print it? sure can <i>jim sullivan's office </i>yeah, walter robinson for jim sullivan tell him it's important, please <i>one moment, please </i><i>hey, robby  everything okay?</i>i need you to tell me something, jim could it be 90 priests?<i>what?</i> could it be as high as 90?<i>jesus, robby </i>i need to know, jim  i wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important <i>you gotta stop this, robby </i>robby, macleish's assistant said he's all booked up, he can't see us yeah  well, the hell he can't all right  that'll be fun you know what, i'll catch up with you, okay?we're good hey, guys, i'm really sorry, i am,but i don't have any time to talk right now,but if you call my assistant   mr  macleish, we have reason to believethat there are allegations against as many as 87 priests in boston i can't talk to you about that does that number sound right to you? you gotta be kidding me i just told you i don't have time for this crap right now eric  how many priests did you settle?robby, you know i can't tell you that you're gonna give me the names and the names of their victims are you threatening me?we've got two stories here we've got a story about degenerate clergy,and we've got a story about a bunch of lawyersturning child abuse into a cottage industry now, which story do you want us to write?'cause we're writing one of them i already sent you a list of names what're you talking about? to whom?the <i>globe</i>  years ago after the porter case  i got plenty of calls i had 20 priests in boston alone,but i couldn't go after them without the press so i sent you guys a list of names, and you buried it i want those names tomorrow check your goddamn clips, robby we didn't find anything in the clips yeah  big surprise richard, do you still go to mass?<i>no  no, i haven't been to church for some time now </i><i>but i still consider myself a catholic </i>how does that work?<i>well, the church is an institution, mike </i><i>made of men </i><i>it's passing  my faith is in the eternal </i><i>i try to separate the two </i>sounds tricky  <i>it is </i><i>especially since the church continues to go after me </i><i>it takes a toll, mike </i><i>they'll try to silence anyone who speaks out </i><i>i'm sure they'll come after you and your team soon enough </i>really? and how do you think they'll do that?hello?richard?who is it?it's the archbishop of canterbury i had dinner at santarpio's, had some leftovers ah, you're the freakin' best  thanks  you want a beer?yeah  you got it jesus how much longer you gonna be in this shithole?yeah  i'm working on it she's a good girl, mike yeah, she is  we'll figure it out i haven't had a lot of time lately i just got off the phone with sipe, actually have you met this guy in person yet?no, but his knowledge of this is on a whole other level i'm freaking starving so, where are we with the 90?we're close  how close?we're close  just answer the question, will you?we got 87 names we're trying to get confirmation  i think we will something bugging you?it's just surprising, that's all yeah  yeah, it is  for everybody oh, hey, ben  i forgot to ask you phil saviano said he sent a bunch of info over to the <i>globe</i> years ago do you have any idea to who?no, why?well, i'm just curious  i wanted to seeif there's any leads you guys didn't run out saviano was a fucking train wreck five years ago, mike we didn't miss anything this story needed spotlight yeah, i agree  i'm just following up good night  yeah, good night this is unbelievable when did you get this?macleish emailed the list this morning he settled cases against 45 priests where are we on law?anything that shows he had knowledge of this?we're still working garabedian  but nothing concrete i keep thinking about that conversation we had the other nightabout how law called down the power of godwhen we reported on porter that's just law being law okay, but i checked the clips,and, uh, porter isn't even in the boston archdiocese - he's from fall river  - sowhy the extreme reaction?law had to know that's why he had the reaction because he knew there were others i think that's the bigger story bigger than 50 priests?if it came from the top down, yes but the numbers clearly indicatethat there were senior clergy involved that's all they do  indicate are you telling me that if we run a storywith 50 pedophile priests in boston   mike!we'll get into the same cat fight you got into on porter,which made a lot of noise,but changed things not one bit we need to focus on the institution, not the individual priests practice and policy show me the church manipulated the systemso that these guys wouldn't have to face charges show me they put those same priestsback into parishes, time and time again show me this was systemic,that it came from the top down sounds like we're going after law we're going after the system make a list of all the victims we have  start reaching out and bring matt in if you need help  mmm-hmm okay  hey, when you go to springfield?- our hearing is monday  - okay hey, robby, you got a second?yeah i, uh, got one of those treatment centersa block from my house we got neighbors with kids i know that the work we do is confidential, but i'm feeling like   i should tell 'em we'll tell 'em soon you sure?yeah  okay hi there  i'm sacha pfeiffer  i'm with <i>the boston globe </i>i was just looking for a gentleman by the name of matthew walsh uh    no, he's not yeah, okay

bishop came over to the house </i>he said nothing like this had ever happened before,and he asked us not to press charges and what did your mother do?my mother?she put out freakin' cookies <i>there was a lot of pressure to keep quiet </i>from the church?yeah, from the church but not just the church from my friends,from the other parishioners <i>well, many of the priests that i treated</i><i>were psychosexually stunted,</i><i>on the emotional level of a 12- or 13-year-old </i>jeez sure the chief knew  everybody knew,but nobody wants to cuff a priest mmm and what about the prosecutor?i shouldn't talk about this shit i think you should, actually do you know a father hurley or a father gale?i do i swear to god, i'll beat the shit out of you sorry to bother you you leave me alone, you

a few questions?go ahead, dear we spoke to several men who you knew when they were boysat st  john the baptist in haverhill they told us you molested them  is that true?sure i fooled around, but i never felt gratified myself right  um, but you admit to molesting boysat st  john the baptist?yes, yes, but as i said,i never got any pleasure from it that's important to understand right um, but can you tell me where and howyou fooled around with these boys?i want to be clear,i never raped anyone there's a difference  i should know how would you know?i was raped i'm sorry, who raped you?ronnie,

you didn't, you cheated!you did!could you please clarify the <i>globe's</i> position for me, mr  albano?yes, judge sweeney our argument to make these documents publicrests mainly on first amendment grounds we also have a number of other relevant arguments after all, your honor,this was a discretionary order yes, it was made at the judge's discretion hey, mike hey, joe what's a spotlight reporterdoing in springfield?your boy albano's sledding uphill you actually think you have a shot at winning this thing?you want me to comment for the <i>herald?</i><i>\"globe</i> reporter would not comment,\"but he did not seem hopeful \"he didn't try and hide it at all he had this really odd rationalization for it like it was totally normalto fool around with little boys i'd really like to go back  i think he'd talk to us oh, we will just not yet i want you to stay focused on the victims right now sacha, where'd they send father talbot again?um, i think    wasn't that cheverus?cheverus, that's right wait, father talbot from bc high?yeah, you know him?yeah, he was there when i was we have a victim?yeah, lives in providence there's nothing personal in these documents, your honor they concern how the cardinal is handling   say \"the archdiocese \"excuse me?you don't get to tag the cardinalwith everything, mr  albano say \"the archdiocese \"judge sweeney, the <i>globe</i> is not a party to this case,they just want to sell papers if mr  garabedian had not smearedthe cardinal's good name,we wouldn't even be here your honor, i object to the use of the word \"smear \"duly noted, mr  garabedian thank you, your honor anything else, mr  rogers?no, your honor mr  albano, you may continue <i>the globe</i> believes having   hey, mitch, how are you doing?i'm fine he's tough, that wilson rogers he's smug and he's sloppy he doesn't seem sloppy you don't know the half of it  trust me what's the half of it?tell me the half of it, mitch off the record? off the record, yeah three years ago, i get a call from an ex-priest anthony benzevich he was at blessed sacrament back in '62,and he saw geoghantaking little boys up to the rectory bedroom, okay?so he's appalled, all right?tells the bishop about it the bishop threatens to reassign himto south america jesus  yeah, all right so fast forward 35 years,benzevich reads that geoghan's been chargedwith molesting hundreds of kids all right? so he feels guilty  he calls me so you have testimony of a priesttelling his superiors about geoghan in '62?no, i do not because when i called benzevich in to give a deposition,he comes in with a lawyer wilson rogers  right and suddenly father benzevichhas a very foggy memory can't remember anything  he's useless so i go back to work,i forget about it  whatever until about a year ago, i find an articleabout a priest who warned church officials about geoghan benzevich went to the press? yeah yeah, local paper, <i>patriot ledger </i> nobody saw it but now i got benzevich on record so i file a motion to depose benzevich a second time all right? and wilson rogers,that smug son of a bitch,he files a motion opposing my motion and that's when i have him have him how?rogers opposes my motion,so i have to make an argumentas to why i'm allowed to deposefather benzevich a second time, okay?but this time, i'm allowed to attach exhibits do you follow what i'm saying?the sealed documents? yes i can attach the sealed documentsthat i've gotten in discovery, mr  rezendes,the same documents that your paper is currently suing for you're shitting me?what? no  no, i'm not shitting you so i pull out the 14 most damning docsand i attach 'em to my motion and they prove everything  everything about the church, about the bishops, about law and it's all public?because your motion to oppose roger's motionis public  yeah, exactly now you're paying attention so i could just walk into that courthouse right nowand get those documents?no, you cannot,because the documents are not there but you just said they're public i know i did, but this is boston,and the church does not want them to be found so they are not there mitch, are you telling me that the catholic churchremoved legal documents from that courthouse?look, i'm not crazy, i'm not paranoid i'm experienced check the docket  you'll see they control everything everything i gotta go back in these guys got the fucking documents docket entry number 49, it's in the geoghan case we're closing in 10 minutes ten minutes? all right - robby  <i>- hey, it's me </i>hey  <i>you're not gonna believe it </i>garabedian gave me a tip  some of the sealed docs are already public they're part of a motion he filed <i>he said they're the best of the bunch </i><i>we don't have to wait for sweeney's ruling </i>so we can get them?<i>yeah, but they're not there </i>already talked to albano he said all we have to do is file a motion,and sweeney will order mitch to refile the docs and you think these

after we saw macleish,i started going back through the clips,and i had a little time last week finally so, um, i found that it's from '93 that it?yeah  yeah, that's it good night okay, good night so, i was probably a few years after you, right?no, you were more than a few believe me well, after bc high, i came down to providenceand played hockey for the friars oh, well, you must have been pretty good no  rode the bench in college  yeah  oh but i loved the city oh  and we just had our third kid and i still get my <i>globe,</i> for the record oh, that's good to know  good to know look, kevin, uh, that's actually why i'm here i need to ask you some questions about father talbot how'd you find out?well   i guess it doesn't matter and i never even told my wife excuse me hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! i need to get in there we're closed  come on, let me in  five minutes i'm sorry, we're closed come on  five minutes hello here this is the geoghan case? that's right those records are sealed  no that's a public motion  those records are public look, i work for the <i>globe </i>good for you can i talk to your supervisor?he's not in today what about a judge?there must be judges that work on this kind of thing sixth floor we understand the nature of the allegations against father talbot i'm just not sure what you want from president kemeza talbot taught here long before bill took over mmm  of course  we just want to knowif it's possible that the president,the faculty, the board,that no one knew what was going on at the time i graduated in 1979, and i had no idea about any of this so if you're suggesting that father gibbons and father callahanhad in any way   gibbons and callahan   i mean, they ran this place like the navy do you really think they didn't know?it's a big school, robby  you know that and we're talking about seven alleged victimsover, what, eight years we're talking about seven that we know about this is ridiculous you're reaching for a story here  we cannot possibly   jack  jack  jack  if i had been president then,i would've known bill, i'm not sure that's relevant why do you think they sent talbot up to cheverus?you know they wanted him out of town robby, as well intentioned as bill's remarks are,i'm hoping we can keep this between usuntil we all get on the same page is that why we're here, to get on the same page?no, we're here because you're an important alumnus, robby,and a friend exactly, and we know you care about this school as much as we do did you play a sport here, jack?yeah  football  why?mmm  i ran track you know, i went to providence yesterdayto talk to one of father talbot's victims he played hockey here and, uh, he's one of the better ones he's got a wife, kids, good job about 10 minutes into the conversation,the guy breaks down you know, couldn't stop crying said he could never figure out why father talbot picked him father talbot coached the hockey team so,i guess we just got lucky you and me does jack dunn work for the school?no, he's pr for boston college they call him when they need help and pete conley? why was he there?good question pete's a big alum, but i called bill directly,and i asked for a sit-down i never mentioned anybody else it's like everybody already knows the story yeah except us  and we work right there judge volterra? yes hi, i'm mike rezendes from <i>the boston globe </i>um, i'm having some troubleaccessing some public recordsdown in the records room i was wondering if i could have a word with you?all right  thank you thank you very much these exhibits you're after, mr  rezendes,they're very sensitive records with all due respect, your honor,that's not the question the records are public maybe so, but tell me,where's the editorial responsibilityin publishing records of this nature?well, where's the editorial responsibility in not publishing them?you can't take those  you need to make copies i'm going to the copy room it closed at 4:00 look, i'll give you83 bucks to use yours hey, cabbie!hey! hey! hey!take me to <i>the boston globe</i> on morrissey boulevard don't take 93  take dorchester avenue <i>robby, it's incredible!</i><i>law knew about geoghan for years, no question </i><i>there's a letter to law from a woman margaret gallant,</i><i>who lived in jamaica plain in the early '80s when geoghan was there </i><i>listen to this,</i><i>\"our family is

lord,\"most reverend john m  darcy, auxiliary bishop of boston \"december 7, 1984 \"an auxiliary bishop wrote that?that's incredible he broke ranks i mean, when did gallant write her letter?1984  and law just ignored it how do you ignore that freakin' letter?we got 'em you can't read these letters and think anything else  it's proof yeah  it is this is good work should we take it up to ben?uh   no  not yet why not? we got law  this is it no, this is law covering for one priest there's another 90 out there yeah, and we'll print that story when we get it,but we gotta go with this now no, i'm not going to rush this story, mike we don't have a choice, robby if we don't rush to print,somebody else is gonna find these letters and butcher the story joe quimby from the <i>herald</i>was at the freakin' courthouse so we'll write a holding story,and we'll keep our eye on the <i>herald </i>keep our eye on the <i>herald?</i>they run this and they get it wrong, the church will bury it we gotta do this now  mike, mike   what? why are we hesitating?baron told us to get law  this is law baron told us to get the system we need the full scope that's the only thing that will put an end to this then let's take it up to ben, let him decide we'll take it to ben when i say it's time it's time, robby  it's time!they knew and they let it happen  to kids!okay? it could've been you! it could've been me!it could have been any of us!we gotta nail these scumbags!we gotta show people that nobody can get away with this!not a priest or a cardinal or a freaking pope!you finished?yeah, i am  this is bullshit oh   you okay?mmm   hey, hansi hard day at work, mike?here  thank you i don't know why i got so pissed off you know, i think robby's wrong you know, you're just   you care about the story, mike  we all do - yeah, i guess  - mmm i stopped going to church with my nana it was    it was too hard you know, i'd be sitting there,and i'd start thinking about joe crowleyor someone else and i just   i just got so angry did you tell her why?she goes to church three times a week, mike it really pisses me off you know,i actually really liked going to church when i was a little kid mmm why'd you stop?typical shit but the weird thing is,i think i   i think i figured that maybe one day   i would actually go back i was really    i was holding on to that mmm i read those letters, and   and something just cracked it's a shitty feeling  yeah it's a shitty feeling looks like a long day hey, pete  i'm sorry to make it longer brian has anyone ever said no to a drink with you, pete?well, sure  but the trick is to keep asking for boston boston mmm so, you here for the cardinal?oh, no, no, no, no  i wouldn't   i wouldn't presume to speak for the cardinal  no you know,you got a lot of people here who respect you, robby,the work you do that's good to know you know, it's because you care about this place it's why you do what you do  it's who you are you know, but people need the church,more than ever right now you know, you can feel it and the cardinal   you know, the cardinal, he might not be perfect,but we can't throw out all the goodhe's doing over a few bad apples now, you know, i'm bringing this up to youbecause i know this is baron's idea, his agenda i gotta tell ya, i mean, honest to god,i mean, he doesn't care about this city the way we do i mean, how could he?this is how it happens, isn't it, pete? what's that?a guy leans on a guy,and suddenly the whole townjust looks the other way robby  robby, look it,marty baron is just trying to make his mark he's gonna be here for a couple of years, and he's gonna move on just like he did in new york and miami where're you gonna go?hmm?good night, robby  brian hey, pete  yeah?uh   when we do run the story, uh, i'm gonna need a comment from the cardinal we'll talk again later  good night, robby good night, pete robby what?no shit  when?okay  yeah hey!what's up?sweeney ruled in our favor she ruled to unseal the documents jeez!the church has already filed an appeal,but the trial court ruling is generally upheld in these matters and when would we get the documents?probably takes cohen a few weeks to rule,then there's a redaction process uh, i'd say they'd be made public mid-january okay  all right thanks, jon  you bet nice work  thanks metro should run something, marty we can't run this one big why wouldn't we? it's a major first amendment victory not to mention, you getan irish catholic judgeruling against the church?- that's a hell of a precedent  - mmm-hmm we don't want the <i>herald</i> going deep on this why's that?you're gonna have to step out, peter i'm not stepping out peter when did you, uh    a couple of weeks ago a couple of weeks?- yeah  - and you're telling us now?these are substantial they clearly show that law was negligent i need more time  i wanna keep digging for what? this is the goddamn story it's not the whole story tough shit  we're on a clock now even if we don't run sweeney's ruling,another paper could find these letters and fuck the story agreed but we run these letters alone,law apologizes, says it's a one-time thing he can bury it how? these clearly show he knew and did nothing about it look, i'm close to stories on 70 priests we nail that, along with those letters,this is proof this is bigger than law it's the whole system you have multiple sources confirming all those priests?on some  i can get more too risky  if we're not buttoned up on every single one of them,the church will pick us apart i think i can get us someonefrom the other side of the aisle somebody inside the church?yeah, a lawyer will he go on the record?deep background  but he's a solid source rezendes needs time to write the story we don't wanna drop it at christmas, not after 9/11 we could run it just after new year's,before they release the rest of the documents all right tell canellos to bury the ruling in metro you got six weeks thank you tell mike i want a draft by christmas and we need a response from lake street who does pr for the cardinal? still john walsh?no, somebody new, donna morrisey she came from tv  she's young good, get a quote we need something from law to appear even-handed robby, next time give me a goddamn heads-up will do <i>silent night, holy night</i><i>all is calm</i><i>all is bright</i><i>round yon virgin, mother and child</i><i>holy infant, so tender and mild</i><i>sleep in heavenly peace</i><i>sleep in heavenly peace</i><i>silent night, holy night</i><i>shepherds quake</i><i>at the sight</i><i>glory streams from heaven

knew something was going on, and no one did a thing we gotta put an end to it don't tell me what i gotta do yeah, i helped defend these scumbags, but that's my job, robby i was doing my job!yeah you and everyone else get out of my house hey!you come to my home and lay this shit on me!you were right, robby we all knew somethin' was going on so where were you?what took you so long?i don't know, jim give me the list larry, we're going to press in six hours donna morrisey said she'd called uswith a quote from law hours ago that's what i thought  when did you talk to her?okay, okay, larry yeah  yeah, that's good to know thanks, pete  anything?conley said donna morrisey should have called, he just left lake street yeah, rasky said the same thing this is ridiculous  you'd think they'd wanna get ahead of this i mean, they'd be idiots not to i would love to see their faces when they read this thing then you know, sunday's the feast of the epiphany it seems appropriate mike rezendes hey, donna  thanks for calling yeah, i just had a few questions if you have a minute what?what? another adjective anything? law just turned us down jesus christ i just got off the phone with donna morrisey she said, quote, we don't even want to knowwhat the questions are, end quote she really said that? yeah well, that oughta do it \"the church had no interest\"in knowing what the <i>globe's</i> questions would be \"work it in somewhere before the jump  anything else?uh, matt wants to put the letters online,so the readers can see for themselves we can run the url at the bottom of the article it's pretty straightforward  okay we also put the spotlight tip line at the end of the storyso people can call in goes directly to our office matt and i can go in in the morning in case we get any calls yeah, i'm more concerned about the phones at reception after we ran the porter case,the message centers were tied up for weeks it's a real problem  there were picketers, too lots of 'em i'll talk to richard about the security and the phones uh, how are we coming on the folo story?well, we've nailed down multiple storieson 70 priests - all 70? - mmm-hmm and with the confirmation from robby's source, we're ready to go we can have a draft next week uh, robby, that source of yours,is it something we could revisit?he might be tough but he has no problem helping the churchprotect dozens of dirty priests guy's a scumbag  he's a lawyer, he's doing his job he's a shill for the church he knew and did nothing he could've said something years ago  maybe saved some lives what about us?what's that supposed to mean?we had all the pieces why didn't we get it sooner?we didn't have all the pieces we had saviano, we had barrett, we had geoghan we had the directories in the basement you know what? we got it now robby, the story needed spotlight mike, spotlight's been around since 1970 so what? we couldn't see the scope of this  no one could robby, this started with one goddamn priest macleish sent us a letter on 20 priests, years ago sacha found the clip you freaking kidding me? 20 priests?when?uh, just after porter  december '93 we buried the story in metro  no folo that was you you were metro yeah  that was me i'd just taken over  i don't remember it at all but yeah   um   can i say something here?sometimes it's easy to forgetthat we spend most of our time stumbling around in the dark suddenly a light gets turned on,and there's a fair share of blame to go around i can't speak to what happened before i arrived,but, um, all of you have done some very good reporting here reporting that i believe is gonna have an immediateand considerable impact on our readers for me, this kind of story is why we do this having said that, cardinal law and the catholic communityare gonna have a very strong response to this so if you need a moment,you've earned it but i will need you back here monday morningfocused and ready to do your job leaving?yeah i, uh, just got a call from the cardinal really  why?he wanted to tell me personallythat he decided not to comment yeah, said he wanted to extend me that courtesy jesus, the balls on that guy  what did you say?i told him he was making a mistake,and that we were gonna run the story damn right we're gonna run it sacha, can i have a drink of water?yeah  sure, nana  yeah can i keep this?sure i thought you should see it first

hungry holy smoke! why did i ever get mixed up with you?if i had any sense, i'd be in new york by this time what about your story?taking a married woman back to her husband i turned out to be the prize sucker all right, come on  your bed's all ready i'll get my clothes all wrinkled - then take them off  - what?all right, don't take them off  do what you please, but shut up about it you're becoming awfully disagreeable lately you just snap my head off every time i open my mouth if being with me is so distasteful to you, you can leave you can leave any time you see fit nobody's holding you here i can get along peter?peter!- what's the matter? - i was so scared!what's got into you? i left for a minute to find you something to eat i know but    here, eat your head off i don't want it

this what are you thinking about?by a strange coincidence, i was thinking of you - really? - yeah i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy what did you say we're supposed to be doing?hitchhiking you've given me a very good example of the hiking where does the hitching come in?it's a little early yet  no cars out if it's the same to you      i'm going to sit right here and wait until they come you got a toothpick?- what's the matter? - i got hay in my teeth no, i haven't got a toothpick  here, i got a penknife, though now hold still - be careful  - all right  where is it?all right, now hold still here  get it?thanks you should have swallowed that  you won't have any breakfast, you know?you needn't rub it in - what are you eating? - carrots - raw? - want one?no  why didn't you get me something i could eat?that's right, i forgot  the idea of offering a raw carrot to an andrews you don't think i'm going around panhandling for you, do you?have one of these  best thing for you, carrots i hate the horrid things i wish you wouldn't talk so much  now we let a car get away and suppose nobody stops for us?they'll stop all right  it's a matter of knowing how to handle them and you're an expert i suppose expert  and i'll write a book about it  call it \"the hitchhiker's hail \"there's no end to your accomplishments, is there?- you think it's simple? - no well, it is simple  it's all in that old thumb, see?some people do it like this  or like this all wrong  never get anywhere the poor things but that old thumb never fails  it's all a matter of how you do it, though now you take no  1, for instance that's a short jerky movement, like this  that shows independence you don't care if they stop or not  you got money - clever  - no  2, that's a little wider movement smile goes with this one, like this that means you got a brand-new story about the farmer's daughter you figured that out all by yourself?that's nothing  no  3, that's a pip  that's the pitiful one when you're broke and hungry, everything looks black it's a long sweeping movement like this  gotta follow through, though that's amazing but it's no good, if you haven't got a long face to go with it here comes a car okay  now watch me  i'm gonna use no  1 keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens i still got my eye on the thumb something must have gone wrong  i'll try no  2 when you get to 100, wake me up i don't think i'll write that book after all think of all the fun you had, though you mind if i try?you?don't make me laugh you're such a smart aleck  nobody knows anything but you i'll stop a car and i won't use my thumb what are you gonna do?it's a system all my own aren't you going to give me a little credit?what for?i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb why didn't you take off all your clothes? you could have stopped 40 cars i'll remember that when we need 40 cars so, you're just married? that's pretty good but if i was young, that's the way i'd spend my honeymoon  hitchhiking yes, sir  \"hitchhiking down the highway\"of love on a honeymoon\"hitchhiking down the highway, down\"aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?tonsil? me? no me burn a tonsil? \"my tonsils won't burn\"all right, let it go \"turn\"how about a bite to eat?- that would be lovely  - no thanks, we're not hungry young people in love are

circles he's right, that's what i've been doing ever since i can remember i've got to settle down it doesn't matter how, where, or with whom you've changed, ellie i can't walk out on king now  it

from him, have you?- don't be silly, of course  - please, what's that?i guess that was his only interest in me, wasn't it?- the reward  - i'm sorry you read it - are you going to see him? - i suppose so certainly  pay him off  he's entitled to it  he did an excellent job he kept me thoroughly entertained  it's worth every penny he gets thank you, mary  that's just what i needed mr  westley's on

whatever you say, darling  it's a promise yeah  who?why can't i see you at your office?i'm leaving for washington tonight  i may be gone several weeks i thought, perhaps, you'd like to get this thing settled yeah  but i don't like the idea of butting in on your jamboree between you and me, those things give me a stiff pain you don't have to see anybody  you can come directly to my study no  why do i wanna--hey, wait a minute  maybe i will come over  yeah i'd like to get a load of that three ring circus you're pulling i wanna see what love looks like when it's triumphant i haven't had a good laugh in a week mr  warne?yeah - sit down  - thanks i was surprised to get your note  my daughter hadn't told me anything      about you  about your helping her that's typical of your daughter  takes those things for granted why did she think i lugged her from miami?she thinks you're entitled to anything you can get she does? isn't that sweet of her? you don't, i suppose well, i don't know  i'll have to see on what you base your claim i presume you feel justified if i didn't, i wouldn't be here  i got it all itemised \"cash outlay, $8 60  top coat, $15 \"suitcase, $7 50  hat, $4 \"three shirts, $4 50  total, $39 60 \"all of the above items had to be sold to buy gasoline \"and i sold some shorts and socks, too  i'm throwing those in - yes, i know  - what's the matter? isn't it cheap enough?trip like that'd cost you a $1,000, maybe more now, let me get this straight  you want $39 60 in addition to the $10,000?what 10,000?the reward who said anything about a reward?i'm afraid i'm a little bit confused  i assumed--all i want is $39 60  if you give me a check for it, i'll get out of this joint it gives me the jitters - you're a peculiar chap  - we'll go into that some other time the average man would go after the reward did anybody ever make a sucker out of you?it's a matter of principle  you probably wouldn't understand when anybody takes me for a buggy ride, i don't like paying for the privilege were you taken for a buggy ride?yes  with all the trimmings  so how about the check, do i get it?- certainly  - thanks here you are thank you do you mind if i ask you a question, frankly?do you love my daughter?any guy in love with your daughter should be examined now that's an evasion she picked herself a perfect running mate, king westley  the pill of the century she needs a guy that'd sock her once a day whether it's coming to her or not if you were wiser, you'd have done it yourself long ago do you love her?a normal man couldn't live with her without going nutty she's my idea of nothing i asked you a simple question! do you love her?yes! now don't hold that against me! i'm a little screwy myself!here's to the merry-go-round perfect  now you look natural - i hope you got your money  - you bet i did - congratulations  - thanks  same to you stay around and watch the fun  you'll enjoy it immensely i would, but i've got a weak stomach - i just had a long talk with him  - i'm not interested now just a minute, ellie i don't want to hear another word about him come on, folks  king westley has arrived here they come, boys  turn them over you're a sucker to go through with this that guy, warne, is okay he didn't want the reward  all he asked for was $39 60 it's what he spent on you  said it was a matter of principle you took him for a ride he loves you, ellie  he told me so you don't want to be married to a mug like westley i can buy him off for a pot of gold and you can make an old man happy and you won't do so bad for yourself if you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of god      and in the face of this company, to join together this man and this woman      in holy matrimony  if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully      be joined together, let him now speak or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace king, will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife so long as you both shall live?i will ellen, will thou have this man to thy wedded husband      so long as you both shall live?ellen!ellie!what happened?i haven't the slightest idea don't

thing you ever did, westley, not to contest that annulment that's satisfactory, isn't it? it ought to be i'm not complaining  not complaining  it was dirt-cheap don't fall out of any windows!there's another wire from peter  they're in glen falls, michigan \"what's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke \"the walls of jericho are toppling \"send him a telegram right away  just say, \"let them topple \"- funny couple, ain't they? - yeah if you ask me, i don't believe they're married they're married, all right  i just seen the license they made me get them a rope and a blanket, on a night

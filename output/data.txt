harlins rodney king these names ring a bell detective  yeah vaguelywe have attorneys for this slain police officer camping in our officeswe have his mother and a half dozen men of the clothwho swear that lewis was one of the twelve apostles of christwe have two black city councilmenand a congresswoman who call on the hour every hourdemanding to know what the district attorney intends to do about thisand you want him to walk into that press roomand tell them all that the situation is complicatedgive us a minuteno problemwho knows about the moneyyou gotta be kiddin methere are only two people in this roommyself my partner ferguson and internal affairs jim ferguson  yeahokay i guess i dont see a problemas it wasnt lewiss car the money isnt clear evidence of any wrongdoingand even if it was we arent going to prosecute a dead manwhich means the money internal affairs is holding cant be considered evidenceyou can do this dance if you want tobut im willing to bet when the coroners report comes back tomorrowits going to say that detective lewis was coked out of his headfucking black people huhwhat did you just sayi meani know all the sociological reasons why per capitaeight times more black men are incarcerated than white menschools are a disgrace lack of opportunity bias in the judicial systemall that stuff all that stuffbut still its gotta get to you on a gut level as a black manthey just cant keep their hands out of the cookie jarof course you and i know thats not the truthbut thats the way it always plays doesnt itand assholes like lewis keep feeding the flames its gotta get to youwhat did you say you did for the da againyou coach ball down in compton am i rightoh please dont do thatdont act like you know something about me okaywhat do you think those kids need to

people huhso all uh all i need to do to make this disappearis to frame a potentially innocent manwhat are you the fucking defender of all things whitewere talking about a white man who shot three black menand youre arguing with me that maybe were not being fair to himyou know what maybe youre right maybe lewis did provoke thisand maybe he got exactly what was coming to himor maybe stoned or not just being a black man in the valleywas enough to get him killedthere was no one there to see who shot first so there is no way to knowwhich means we could get this wrongmaybe thats what happened with your brother maybe we got it wrongmaybe lewis isnt the only one who deserves the benefit of the doubtyoure the one closest to all thisyou need to tell uswhat does your gut tell youso grahamwhat

and down europein europe he is claimed as the kings enemyrubbish crank he may be traitor he is notexactly and with a little pressurewith a little pressure he can be got to say sothats all we need a brief declaration of his loyalty  to the present administration  i still say let sleeping dogs liethe king does not agree with youwhat kind of pressure do you think you can bring to beari have evidence that sir thomas while he was a judge accepted bribeswhatgoddammit he was the only judge since cato who didnt accept bribeswhen was there a chancellor whose possessions after three yearstotaled \u00e2\u00a3100 and a gold chainit is as you imply common practicebut a practice may be common and remain an offencethis offence could send a man to the towercome herethis womans name is averil machin she comes from leicester she entered a case  a property case it wasshut your moutha property case in the court of requests in april 1528and got a wicked false judgmentand got an impeccably correct judgment from sir thomas no sir it was not  tell the gentlemanabout the gift you gave the judgei gave him a cup sira silver italian cup i bought in leicester for 100 shillingsdid sir thomas accept this cupyes sir he didhe did accept it we can corroborate that you can go to my way of thinking  go is that your witness  noby an odd coincidence that cup later came into the hands of master rich herehow he gave it to me your grace  gave it to you whya giftyes you were a friend werent youwhen did thomas give you this thingi cant exactly rememberdo you remember what you did with it i sold it  where a shop  has the shop still got itno theyve lost all track of ithow convenientyou doubt master richs word your graceit had occurred to methis is the bill of salethat cow put her case into court in april you said this is dated mayin other words the moment thomas knew the cup was a bribehe dropped it into the nearest gutterthe facts will bear that interpretation i supposethis is a horse that wont run master secretaryjust a trial gallop well find something better i want no part of it  you have no choicewhats that you saythe king particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of sir thomashes not told me thatindeed he told melook here cromwellwhats the purpose of all thisthere you have meits a matter of conscience i thinkthe king wants sir thomas to bless his marriageif sir thomas appeared at the wedding now it might save us all a lot of troublehe wont attend the weddingif i were you id try and persuade himi really would try if i were youcromwell are you threatening memy dear norfolk this isnt spainthis is englandthomas thomaslady margaretyesweve been cutting greens we use them for fueli have a letter for your father lady margaret from hampton courthes to answer certain charges before secretary cromwellgood of you to come sir thomasmaster rich will make a record of our conversationgood of you to tell me master secretaryi think you know one anotherindeed yes were old friendsthats a nice gown you have richardsir thomas believe meno thats asking too much but let me tell you all the sameyou have no more sincere admirer than myselfno not yet rich not yetif i might hear the charges the charges  i understand there are certain chargessome ambiguities of behavior i should like to clarify hardly chargesmake a note of that will you master rich there are no chargessir thomas sir thomasthe king is not pleased with youi am grievedand yet do you know that even now if you could bring yourselfto agree with the church universities the lords and the commonsthere is no honor which his majesty would be likely to deny youi am well acquainted with his graces generosityvery wellyou have heard of the socalled holy maid of kentwho was executed for prophesying against the king yes i met her  yes you met heryet you did not warn his majesty of her treason how was thatshe spoke no treason our talk was not politicalbut the woman was notorious do you expect me to believe that happily there were witnesses  you wrote a letter to heryes i wrote advising her to abstain from meddling in the affairs of statei have a copy of the letter also witnessed you have been cautious  i like to keep my affairs regularin the june of 1521 the king published a booka theological workit was called a defense of the seven sacramentsfor which he was named defender of the faith by his holiness the popeby the bishop of rome or do you insist on popeno bishop of rome if you like it doesnt alter his authoritythank you you come to the point very readily what is that authorityfor example in the church of englandwhat exactly is the bishop of romes authorityyou will find it very ably set out and defended master secretaryin the kings bookin the book published under the kings name would be more accurate you wrote this book  i wrote no part of iti dont mean you actually held the peni answered to my best ability some points of common lawwhich the king put to me as i was bound to dodo you deny you instigated itit was from first to last the kings own projectthe king says notthe king knows the truth of itand whatever he may have said to youhe will not give evidence to support this accusationwhy notbecause evidence is given on oath and he will not perjure himselfif you dont know that then you dont yet know himsir thomas morehave you anything to sayregarding the kings marriage with queen annei understood i was not to be asked that againthen you understood wrongly these chargesthey are terrors for children master secretary not for methen know that the king commands me to charge youin his name with great ingratitudeand to tell you that there never was nor could be so villainous a servantnor so traitorous a subject as yourselfsoi am brought

itcause this countrys religion means nothing to you at allwell thats a foolish saying for a startthe nobility of englandthe nobility of england would have snored through the sermon on the mountbut youll labor like scholars over a bulldogs pedigreean artificial quarrel is not a quarrelweve had a quarrel since the day we met our friendship was mere slothyou can be cruel when you want but ive always known thatwhat do you value in your bulldogs gripping is it not yes  its their nature yes  its why you breed themits so with meni will not give in because i oppose itnot my pride not my spleen nor any other of my appetites but i do iis there in the midst of all this muscle no sinew that serves no appetiteof norfolks but is just norfolk there is give that some exercise my lord  thomasas you stand youll go before your maker ill conditionednow steadyand hell think that somewhere back along your pedigree a bitch got over the wallcast in this very house on april 3 last yearit is a matter very fit for the commons gathered herein parliament to take in handor in consequence of the decay of guildsthe woolen cloth now coming out of yorkshire lincolnand the like is not to blame and thisi will defer the rest of my matter to laterthat the loyal commons here assembled will speedily enact this bill i doubt notfor as much as it concerns the kings new title and his marriage to queen anneboth matters pleasing to a loyal subjectmark my mastersthere is among us a brood of discreet traitorsto which deceit the king can brook no longerand we his loyal huntsmen must now drive these subtle foxes from their covertfathermargareti couldnt get a boatwhat is it megfather theres a new act going through parliamentand by this act theyre going to administer an oathabout the marriageon what compulsion is the oath high treason  but what is the wordingdo the words matter we know what it meanstell me the wordsan oath is made of words it may be possible to take ittake itand if it can be taken you must take it toonolisten meg god made the angels to show him splendoras he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicitybut man he made to serve him wittily in the tangle of his mindif he suffers us to come to such a case that there is no escapingthen we may stand to our tackle as best we canand yes meg then we can clamor like champions if we have the spittle for itbut its gods part not our own to bring ourselves to such a passour natural business lies in escapingif i can take this oath i willi would for my sake you could take the oathi never took a man into the tower less willinglythank you master governorthank yousir thomassir thomassir thomasthis is iniquitous where to this time  richmond palacesit downthis is the seventh commission to inquire into the caseof sir thomas more appointed by his majestys councilhave you anything to sayno seen this document before  many timesit is the act of successionthese are the names of those who have sworn to it i have as you say seen it before  will you swear to itnothomas we must knowwe must know plainly whether you recognize the offspring of queen anneas heirs to the thronethe king in parliament tells me that they are of course i recognize them  will you swear to it yes  then why wont he swear to the actbecause there is more than that in the actjust so sir thomas it states in the preamble that the kings former marriageto the lady catherine was unlawfulshe being his brothers widow and the pope having no authority to sanction itis that what you denyis that what you disputeis that what you are not sure ofyou insult his majesty and council in the person of the lord archbishopi insult no onei will not take the oath i will not tell you why i will not then your reasons must be treasonable  not must be may beits a fair assumptionthe law requires more than an assumption the law requires a factof course i cannot judge your legal standing in the casebut until i know the ground of your objectionsi can only guess your spiritual standing tooif youre willing to guess that it should be small matter to guess my objectionsthen you do have objections to the actwell we know that cromwellno my lord you dontyou may suppose i have objections all you know is that i will not swear to itfor which you cannot lawfully harm me furtherbut if you were right in supposing me to have objections and right againin supposing my objections to be treasonablethe law would let you cut my head offoh yeswell done sir thomasive been trying to make that clear to his grace for some timeoh confound all this im not a scholari dont know if the marriage was lawful or notbut damn it thomas look at these nameswhy cant you do as i did and come with us for fellowshipand when we die and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscienceand i am sent to hell for not doing mine will you come with me for fellowshipso those of us whose names are there are damned sir thomasi have no window to look into another mans consciencei condemn no one then the matter is capable of question  certainlybut that you owe obedience to the king is not capable of questionso weigh a doubt against a certainty and signsome men think the earth is round others think it flatit is a matter capable of questionbut if it is flat will the kings command make it roundand if it is round will the kings command flatten itno i will not signthen you have more regard for your own doubt than the kings command for myself i have no doubt  no doubt of whatno doubt that i will not take this oathbut why i will not you master secretary will not trick out of mei might get it out of you in other waysyou threaten like a dockside bullyhow should i threatenlike a minister of state with justicejustice is what youre threatened withthen i am not

more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth well so youve always told me  yesthen say the words of the oath and in your heart think otherwisewhat is an oath then but words we say to godlisten megwhen a man takes an oath hes holding his own self in his own handslike waterand if he opens his fingers then he neednt hope to find himself againsome men arent capable of this but id be loathed to think your father one of them i have another argument  oh megin any state that was half good you would be raised up high not here  for what youve done already  all rightits not your fault the states threequarters badnoif you elect to suffer for it you elect to be a herothats very neatbut look now if we lived in a state where virtue was profitablecommon sense would make us saintlybut since we see that avarice anger pride and stupiditycommonly profit far beyond charity modesty justice and thoughtperhaps we must stand fast a littleeven at the risk of being heroesbut in

refusedhe calls this silenceyet is there a man in this courtis there a man in this countrywho does not know sir thomas mores opinion of this titleyet how can this bebecause this silence betokenednay this silence was not silence at all but most eloquent denialnot sonot so master secretarythe maxim of the law is silence gives consentif therefore you wish to construe what my silence betokenedyou must construe that i consented not that i deniedis that in fact what the world construes from itdo you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from itthe world must construe according to its witsthis court must construe according to the lawmy lords i wish to call sir richard richrichard rich come into courtrichard richi do swear the evidence ill give before the court shall be the

master more take me for kingthat i would he saidfor then you would be kingyesthen he said but i will put you a higher casehow if there were an act of parliament to say that god should not be god this is true and then you said  silencecontinuebut then i said i will put you a middle caseparliament has made our king head of the churchwhy will you not accept himwelland then he said parliament had not the power to do itrepeat the prisoners wordshe saidparliament had not the competenceor words to that effecthe denied the titlehe didin good faith rich i am sorrier for your perjury than my peril do you deny this  yesyou know if i were a man who heeded not the taking of an oathi need not be herenow i will take an oathif what master rich has said is truei pray i may never see god in the facewhich i would not say were it otherwise for anything on earth that is not evidence  is it probableis it probable that after so long a silence on thisthe very point so urgently sought of mei should open my mind to such a man as thatsir richard do you wish to modify your testimonyno my lordis there anything you wish to take away from itno my lordhave you anything to addno my lord have you sir thomas  to

guilty of high treason the sentence of the court  my lordswhen i was practicing the law the manner was to ask the prisonerbefore pronouncing sentence if he had anything to sayhave you anything to sayyessince the court has determined to condemn megod knoweth howi will now discharge my mindconcerning the indictment and the kings titlethe indictment is grounded in an act of parliamentwhich is directly repugnantto the law of god and his holy churchthe supreme government of which no temper able personmay by any law presume to take upon himthis was grantedby the mouthof our savior christ himselfto st peter and the bishops of rome whilst he livedand was personally presenthere on earthit is therefore insufficient in lawto charge any christian to obey itand more than thisthe immunity of the church is promised both in magna cartaand in the kings own coronation oathnow we plainly see you are maliciousnot soi am the kings true subjectand i pray for him and all the realmi do none harmi say none harmi think none harmand if this be not enough to keep a man alivethen in good faith i long not to liveneverthelessit is not for the supremacy that you have sought my bloodbut because i would not bend to the marriageyou have been found guilty of high treasonthe sentence of the court is that you be takento the tower of londonuntil the day hence to the appointmentfor your executioni am commanded by the king to be briefand since i am the kings obedient subjectbrief i will bei die his majestys good servantbut gods firsti forgive you right readilybe not afraid of your officeyou send me

measure siri can take it then that you would be acutely grieved to discoverthat any behaviour or action on your part were causing her griefnaturally sir i would deeplygood i was sure of ithere in cambridge weve always been proud of our athletic prowesswe believe weve always believed that our games are indispensablein helping to complete the education of an englishmanthey create characterthey foster courage honesty and leadershipbut most of all an unassailable spirit of loyaltycomradeship and mutual responsibility would you agree  yes sir i wouldim afraid there is a growing suspicion in the bosom of this universityand i tell you this without in any waydecrying your achievements in which we all rejoicethat in your enthusiasm for successyou have perhaps lost sight of some of these idealsmay i ask what form this disloyalty this betrayal takes oh hardly betrayal  the word grief was mentionedits said that you use a personal coachmr mussabini yes is he italian  of italian extraction yes i see  but not all italian im relieved to hear it  hes half arabdo we take it that you employ this mr mussabini on a professional basissam mussabini is the finest most advancedclearestthinking athletics coach in the countryim honoured to be worthy of his attentionnevertheless hes a professionalwhat else would he be hes the bestbut there mr abrahams im afraid our paths divergeyou see this university believes that the way of the amateuris the only one to provide satisfactory resultsi am an amateuryoure being trained by a professionalyouve adopted a professional attitudefor the past year you have concentrated on developing your own techniquein the headlong pursuit may i suggest of individual glorynot a policy very conducive to the fostering of iesprit de corpsii am a cambridge man first and lasti am an englishman first and lastwhat i have achieved what i intend to achieve is for my familymy university and my countryand i bitterly resent your suggesting otherwiseyour aim is to win at all costs is it notat all costs no but i do aim to win within the rulesperhaps you would rather i played the gentleman and lostto playing the tradesman yesmy dear boy your approach has been if i may say so a little too plebeianyou are the eliteand are therefore expected to behave as suchthank you sirfor your hospitalitythe evening has been most illuminatinggood night to you siryou know gentlemenyou yearn for victory just as i dobut achieved with the apparent effortlessness of godsyours are the archaic values of the prep school playgroundyou

green and fragranti just had to be a part of itand the untersberg kept leading me higher and higheras though it wanted me to go right through the clouds with itchild suppose darkness had come and you were lostoh mother i could never be lost up therethats my mountain i was brought up on itit was the mountain that led me to youohwhen i was a child i would come down the mountainand climb a tree and look over into your gardenid see the sisters at work and id hear them sing on their way to vesperswhich brings me to another transgression reverend motheri was singing out there today without permissionmaria it is only here in the abbey that we have rules about postulants singingi cant seem to stop singing wherever i amand whats worse i cant seem to stop saying thingseverything and

officerspersonally im appalledlets not get excitedwill you have a cigarno thank youwhen i said all officers must worknaturally l never meant you the commanding officermy orders were only intended for officers belownone of my officers will do manual laborplease i was about to sayive been thinking the matter over and have decidedto put majors and above on administrative dutiesleaving only junior officers to lend a handim afraid not the conventions quite clear on that pointdo you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in timei havent the foggiestid have to kill myselfwhat would you do if you were mei suppose if l were youid have to kill myselfcheersi warn you colonelif i am to die others will die before medo you understand thatmajor clipton did mention that wellthat wont solve your problembut im sure we can arrive at a proper solutionplease sit downnow tell me coloneldo you agree that the first job of an officer is commandof course goodnowtake this bridge of yoursits quite an enormous undertakingfrankly i have grave doubts whether your lieutenant whats his namemiura miurais capable of tackling a job of such importanceon the other hand l have officers reeves and hughes for instancewho have built bridges all over indiathe men respect themits essential for an officer to have that respect im sure you agreeif he loses it he ceases to commandand what happens then demoralization and chaosa pretty poor commander i would be if l allowed that to happenperhaps you are not awarethat the bridge is now under my personal commandreally and may l ask are you satisfied with the workl am not youve proved my pointi hate the britishyou are defeated but you have no shameyou are stubborn but have no prideyou endure but you have no couragei hate the britishpointless going on like thisstay therestand down stand downbattalion attentionbattalion stand at easepleasedo you know what is the date today colonelim afraid ive lost countits the anniversary of our great victoryover russia in 1905 oh yesthroughout east asia we are celebrating this datein honor of this occasionl have given your troops a day of restmany thanksi am declaring a general amnestyyou and your officers may return to your quartersas part of this amnestyit will not be necessary for officers to do manual laborhes done itsomebody deserves a medal sirhow many men in your partywell l dont really know siryou dont know sir 1 2 usuallybut well one of the men took sick very suddenly this morning sirit took three or four to help him to the hospitaland he took terrible sick sira corporal should always know how many men he has under himoh yes sirhave you a nervous affliction if not stop making those faces at onceit may be funny to you but its not military behaviorno sirwe must put a stop to these demonstrationsyes sirl say reeves yes siryou ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the kwaiyes sir half a dozen of them in madras bengalif this were your bridgehow would you get it under wayget it under way sirwell first of all i wouldnt build it hereoh why notas l was trying to tell youthe japanese couldnt have picked a worse location theres no bottomyou see those pilestheyre sinkingour chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldnt holdwhere would you build itwhy further downstream sir across those narrowsthen wed have solid bedrock on both bankshughes if this were your bridge how would you use the menwell sir not the way theyre doing it its utter chaos as you can seeits a lot of uncoordinated activityno teamworksome of those parties are actually working against each otheryesi tell you gentlemen we have a problem on our handsthanks to the japanese we now command a rabbletheres no order no disciplineour task is to rebuild the battalion yes sirwhich isnt going to be easybut fortunately we have the means at hand the bridgethe bridge sir the bridgewell teach them a lesson in western efficiency that will put them to shamewell show them what the british soldier is capable ofyes l see your point siri realize how difficult its going to be herewhere you cant find what you needbut theres the challenge l beg your pardon siryou mean you really want them to build the bridgeyoure not usually so slow on the uptake evansi know our men youve got to keep them occupiedfact is if there werent any work wed invent some eh reevesthat we would sir so were luckybut its going to be a proper bridgehere again l know the menits essential that they take pride in their jobright gentlemen yes sirreeves youre the key man in this situation as engineertell me what you want and well organize it can we make a go of itwell do our best sir finewe must draw up our plansthen arrange a conference with saitoand set him straightwell l think that takes care of all the procedural matters nowoh yesthe next point is somewhat unpleasant for all concerned im afraidsorry to tell you we feel the position of the bridge was fixed hastilyand l have to add incorrectlyincorrectlyunfortunately yesour engineer has made a study of the siteand has concluded that the river bottom there is too softtoo softmud all the work up to now has been uselessreeves will you carry on yes sircolonel ive made teststhose piles of yours could be hammered below water level before theyd holdthat bridge would collapse under the first trainthe pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inchjust a moment reeves before you get too involvedcolonel do you suppose we could have a cup of teathen l take it we all agree that if were to avoid disasterwe build a new bridge at the site picked by reeves400 yards downstreamso lets proceed to the next pointive decided to alter the daily work quota of our menalter yes ive increased itfrom a yard and a half of earth moved to twoi was sure it would meet with your approvalmajor hughes has all the facts hughes would you take overive done a time study colonel saito of the entire projectas you can see the available forces have been badly distributedi would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working partiesjust a moment colonel it would save time if we could work during dinnerwould it be possible to have a meal served hereof courseif wecarry on hughes yes sirif we increase the number of squads and specialize their functionsim certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percentnow colonel saito i have one more pointnow theres another important decision that cant be postponedas most of the british will work on the bridgeonly a small number will be available for railway worki must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gangso the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possiblei have already given the orderwe must fix the daily work quota for your meni thought of setting it at a yard and a half so as not to overtire thembut isnt it best to be the same as oursthat would also create a healthy competitive spiriti have already given the orderwell try to surpass that wont we yes siri think that completes the agenda for this eveningthank you colonel saito for your kind attentionand are there any other questionsone questioncan you finish the bridge in timefrankly the consensus of opinion is that its impossiblebut well certainly give it a gowe mustnt forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreementfor which l was not to blameis there anything elsenothank you the meeting is closedgood night good nighti hope these japanese appreciate what were doing for themfor the moment im not concerned with their appreciationgood

oriental languages at cambridge before the wari never congratulated you on your escape lt was a good showi was lucky if your searescue plane hadnt spotted me l wouldnt be hereno i suppose notwould you like to see where you wereall rightour informations rather scanty its mostly based on your reportbut we think the camp is about heresay do your people have any idea what happened to colonel nicholsonhe had guts they were about to shoot him and he didnt bat an eyeif youre about to be shot theres not much you can dohere is the river kwai and here is the village where you were helpedand here is the railwaybut then you must be fairly familiar with all this areanot really l was out of my head half the timethe railway starts down here in singapore malayabangkok rangoon their idea is to drive on through into indiawhere was i picked up oh about herethe japanese aim to open the bangkok rangoon section by the middle of maynaturally well try to prevent themits too far for bombers to carry an adequate loadwell have to go smash it on the groundhow will you get there parachute drop then marchwith demolition equipment through that jungleour chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledgeyou see none of us have ever been therel dont want to discourage lt should be interestingcolonel greens given me the kwai bridgeim gonna take a team in and blow it uplucky yousure you wont have teano thanks l dont want to be rude but ive got a luncheon date at 2so if there are any questions of course im sorrywell there is only one question actuallyhow would you feel about going backcome againi know under the circumstances its a bit muchbut you have a unique knowledge for our purposeand wed love to have you with usthats why you brought me hereto ask me thiswell frankly yesmajor i just got out of there my escape was a miraclenow you want me to go back dont be ridiculousthis is embarrassingi cant go back l dont belong to you i belong to the american navyactually colonel green has taken the matter up with your peoplewith my people your navys turned you over to usa signal arrived yesterday morning from your clnc pacificauthorizing your temporary transfer of duty to force 31 6they cant do this to me im afraid they haveit was difficult to know how to break it to youbut they cant do this to me i mean it my navys made a mistakelook im not a navy commander im not even an officerthe whole things a fake im just an ordinary swab jockey second classwhen the houston sunk l made it ashore with a real commanderlater on we ran into a japanese patrol he was killedi figured it was just a matter of time before l was capturedso you changed uniforms with a dead mani thought officers would get better treatmentthats very sensiblebut at saitos camp the officers worked along with the restyes theres always the unexpected isnt therei kind of got used to being a commanderso when l arrived here at the hospitall took a look at the enlisted mens ward and then the officers wardand l said to myself lets let it ride along for a whilethere were certain advantagesi saw one of them on the beachanyway thats the whole storythe point is you cant use me you want an officeran american commander named shears who doesnt existwhen the navy learns the truth theyll sayship him home in irons for impersonating an officeronce that happens ive got it made got it whatmade id like that drink now of courseill apply for a medical dischargeill tell them i impersonated an officerbecause i went off my rocker in the jungleim getting worse you know sometimes i think im admiral halseyits quite a clever planits not only clever its foolproofif my navy finds out who l amthose temporary orders wont be worth the paper theyre written onthis is your photograph isnt itwhere did you get this lt took a bit of doingbecause your people couldnt identify youfinally your clnc pacific sent us a copy of your service recordthe photograph fingerprints would you care to have a looknoyou see weve known about your actual rank for nearly a weekyour navys in an awkward positionin one sense youre a blasted herofor making an escape from the junglebut at the same time they cant bring you homeand give you the navy cross for impersonating an officeri suppose thats why they were so happy to hand you over to usyou seehot potatoas far as your present rank is concernedwere fairly informal about those things in force 31 6youd have the simulated rank of majorsimulated major that figureswellas long as im hooked i might as well volunteergood showoh colonel green sirthis is major shears he volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridgereallygood showjolly good show majorget up to sick bay baker this foots infectedthe colonel might think im malingeringim the medical officer baker get crackingwill someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridgedont you worry about old nick he knows what hes doinghello clipton about time you paid us a visitfine job our chaps are doing firstrateyes hows he behavinghes been most reasonable since we took overl wonder what hes thinking l havent the foggiestthanks reeves right sirwhat do you thinkquite a challenge isnt itsir are you convinced that building this bridge is a good ideaare you serious yes sira good idea take another lookyou dont agree morale is high discipline has been restoredtheir condition has been improvedare they a happier lot or arent they yes sir butthey feed better and they are no longer abusedthats all true well thenhonestly clipton there are times when l dont understand you at allill try to make myself clear sirthe fact is what were doing could be construed asforgive me sir collaboration with the enemyperhaps even as treasonable activitywere prisoners of war we havent the right to refuse to worki understand that sir but must we work so wellmust we build them a better bridge than they could have themselvesif you had to operate on saito would you do your best or let him diewould you prefer we disintegrate in idlenesswould you have it said that our chaps cant do a proper jobits important to show these people they cant break us in body or in spirittake a good look cliptonone day the war will be overi hope that the people who use this bridge in years to comewill remember how it was built and who built itnot a gang of slaves but soldiers british soldiers even in captivityyes sir youre a fine doctorbut youve a lot to learn about the armyhold him hold himuse your boot get your boot in there will yougood morningwhat on earth are you people staring atget on with your jobsnow get him with your bootim

pick the fourth member of your teamask mr joyce to come in yes sirchapman here wants joyce but i have my doubts about himi think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculationas ive told you beforein this job even when its finished theres always one more thing to dohes the best swimmer in the school sirim well aware of your evaluation the opinion i want is shearsall right at easethese gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a hike into the jungleyes siryou were an accountant in montrealyes sir not really an accountant sirthat is l didnt have my charterexactly what did you dowell sir i just checked columns and columns of figureswhich people had checked before meand then other people checked them after i had checked themsounds a frightful bore sir it was a frightful borehow did you happen to wind up herein 39 l came over to london to enlistabout two years later i volunteered for this workyou volunteered yes sir see the regular armygo ahead you can be frankwell the regular army reminded me of my job in civilian lifethey dont expect you to thinkthink about thisare you quite sure youd be able to use it in cold bloodi know how to use it sirthats not what l meant could you use it in cold bloodcould you kill without hesitationthats a question ive often asked myself sir its worried me quite a bitand what was the answeri dont honestly know sirive tried to imagine myselfi suppose i find it hard to kid myself that killing isnt a crimeits an old army problemwell l think thats all thank you joyceam l to go with the team sirwell let you knowyou see what i meanwell at least he was honestnone of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment ariseswhats your opinion shearswell sir hes canadianand thats in keeping with the international composition of this outfitif he wants to go he can even take my placewell if youre all agreed on joyce hes yoursi had a report from air reconnaissance on that villagetheres sufficient clearing to make your jump at last lightyouve had parachute training no sirblast this is awkwardsilly it never occurred to mewell maybehes right arrange some practice jumps for himill pop over and check right awayall

and all of thatits one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackershes not without experience you knowwhen we lost singapore he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridgesand many other installations before the japs caught himcaught him yesfascinating story he sir its most annoyingin view of time they dont think practice jumps would be worthwhileno if you make one jumpyouve only got 50 percent chance of injurytwo jumps 80 percent three jumps youre bound to get your packetthe consensus is the most sensible thing for major shears to dois to go ahead and jump and hope for the bestwith or without parachuteoh very goodwith or withouthes in the treesyai says we cant reach the kwai by the route you tookthere are too many japanese patrols well swing north through heavy junglewhos gonna lead the way yai himselfhe hates the japanese they took all his menwhich means we shall have to use women bearerswomen bearers theyre very capable im toldhe says its dangerous to

littleif not for the train we could set a time fuse and be miles awaysince we dont know what time itll cross tomorrowwell have to do the job manuallywell set the charges against the pilesabout three feet under the water i should thinkand run the main wire downstream to the plungerthe problem is where to hide itour side of the river is quite obviously used by the japanesetheyd spot it at oncelook do you see those fallen tree trunksand the grey rock just below them on that little beachyes sir l see them thats our key positionits on the wrong side of the riverbut its the only hiding place within feasible distanceas soon as the bridge goes upwhoevers there will have to swim backits not likely to be a pleasant swimsir l was the best swimmer in my courseyeahit looks like your line of country thenthank you sirshears pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover joyceyai will be with you so you can occupy the nipsif they make any trouble for joyce righton the theory that theres

bob on the coverthe duck of deathits the duke duke of deathyou always were the hell in jesus with a pistol but seven of themprotecting that woman how do you do thatits desirable in the publishing business to take a certain  liberty when depicting the cover scenefor reasons involving the marketplace from what i read the writings not that much different than the picturei can assure you mr daggett  that the events described are from eyewitness accountseyewitnesseslike the duck himself i guessthe dukeduck i saysyou have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman corcoran  said the duckyou must apologizebut twogun corcoran would have none of ithe reached for his pistols and would have killed him  but the duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixgunsi consider that an accurate depiction of eventsthere is a certain poetry to the language which i couldnt resisti was in the blue bottle saloon in wichita  the night english bob killed corky corcorani didnt see you therenor no womannor twogun shooters nor none of this  you were thereyeah i was therefirst off  corky never carried two guns though he should havehe was called twogun corcorana lot of folks did call him twogun but not because he had two pistolsit was because his dick  was longer than the barrel on his walker coltonly insulting he did was stick it into a french lady bob was sweet onwhen corky walked into the blue bottle and before he knew whats what  bob takes a shot at him and misses hes so damn drunkthat bullet whizzing by panicked corky he did the wrong thinghe hurried and shot his damn toe offmeantime bob here  aims real good and squeezes off another  but he misses hes still so drunk hits a 1000 mirror over the barthe duck of death is as good as dead because corky does it righthe aims real careful no hurry  andthat walker colt blew up in his hand a failing common to that modelif corkyd had two guns instead of a big dick he wouldve been there  to defend himself to the endwait a minuteenglish bob killed him when he didnt even have bob wasnt going to wait for corky to grow a new handno he just walked over there real slow  because he was drunk  and shot him through the liverdont like rocks on my dadgum back i sure do miss my bed  you said that last nightlast night i said i missed my wife tonight i just miss my dadgum bedyoull miss your dadgum roof next i

the duck than english bobfaster faster was his mistakeif he hadnt rushed he wouldnt have shot himself in the toehe wouldve killed old bobbeing a good shot being quick with a pistol  dont do no harm but it dont mean much next to being coolheadeda man wholl keep his head not get rattled under fire  like as not hell kill you but if the other fellow is quicker   then hell hurry and hell misslook

seacockswhat are the seacocksseathe seacocks are the valves to drain out the boattheyre always kept tight closed when youre afloatyeswell yesterday when i examined that boat i found theyd been openedwhat could be the reason for thatjust this thats what flooded the boat and sunk herare you implying that boat never capsized at alli know its a terrible thing to say sir but in my opinionshe was scuttled and theres them holes  what holes in her planking  what are you talking aboutof course that boats been underwater for over a yearand the tides been knocking her against the ridgebut it seemed to me them holes looked as if shed made them from the insidethen you believe she must have done it deliberatelycouldnt have been no accident not with her knowledge of boatsyou knew the former mrs de winter very well i believeoh yeswould you have believed her capable of suicideno frankly i would not but you never can tellyou may stand down mr tabbmr de winter pleasesorry to drag you back for

late mrs de winters boatwell of course i cant think of any reasonhas anyone ever discussed these holes with you beforewell since the boat has been at the bottom of the oceani scarcely think that likelymr de winter i want you to believe we all feel very deeplyfor you in this matterbut you must remember that i dont conduct this inquiryfor my own amusement thats rather obvious isnt it  i hope

down to manderley right awayi shall be at the cottage all this eveningand shall leave the door open for youi have something terribly important to tell yourebecca now does that look like the note of a womanwho had made up her mind to kill herselfand apart from that do you mean to tell methat if you wanted to commit suicide you would go to all the troubleof putting out to sea in a boat and then take a hammer and chiseland laboriously knock holes through the bottom of itcome colonel as an officer of the lawdont you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion of murder  what elseyouve known max a long time so you know hes the oldfashioned typewhod die to defend his honor or whod kill for itits blackmail pure and simpleblackmail is not so pure nor so simpleit can bring a lot of trouble to a great many peopleand the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of itoh i see youre going to hold de winters hand through all thisjust because hes the big noise around hereand hes actually permitted you to dine with himbe careful favell youve brought an accusation of murder have you any witnesses  i do have a witnessits that fellow benif that stupid coroner hadnt been as much

brooklynphilip tattagliaand from staten islandwe have with us victor strachiand the other associates that came as far as from california and kansas cityand all the other territories of the country thank youhow did things ever get so fari dont knowit was so unfortunate so unnecessarytattaglia lost a son and i lost a sonwere quits and if tattaglia agreesthen im willing to let things go on as beforewere grateful to don corleone for calling this meetingwe all know him as a man of his word a modest man who listens to reasonyes don barzini hes too modesthe had all the judges and politicians in his pockethe refused to share themwhen did i ever refuse an accommodationall of you know mewhen did i ever refuse except one time and whybecause i believe this drug business will destroy us in the years to comeits not like gambling or liquor or even womenwhich is something that most people want but is forbidden by the churcheven the police that have helped us in the past with gambling and other thingsare going to refuse to help us when it comes to narcoticsi believed that then and i believe that nowtimes have changedits not like the old days when we could do anything we wanteda refusal is not the act of a friendif don corleone had all the judges and politicians then he must share themor let others use them he must let us draw the water from the wellcertainly he can present a bill for such servicesafter all were not communistsi also dont believe in drugsfor years i paid my people extra so they wouldnt do that kind of businesssomebody says to them  i have powders if you put up 34000 dollar investmentwe can make 50000 distributingthey cant resist i want to control it as a business keep it respectablei dont want it near schools i dont want it sold to childrenthats an inf\u00e3\u00a0miain my city we would keep the traffic to the coloredtheyre animals so let them lose their soulsi hoped that we could come here and reason togetherand im willing to do whatever is necessary to find a peaceful solutionwe are agreed the traffic in drugs will be permitted but controlleddon corleone will give us protection in the east and there will be peacei must have strict assurance from corleoneas time goes by and his position becomes strongerwill he attempt any individual vendettawe are all reasonable men we dont have to give assurancesyou talk about vengeancewill vengeance bring your son back to youor my boy to mei forgo the vengeance of my sonbut i have selfish reasonsmy youngest son was forced to leave this countrybecause of this sollozzo businessand i have to make arrangements to bring him back here safelycleared of all these false chargesbut im a superstitious manif an unlucky accident should befall him if he should be shot by a police officeror if he should hang himself in his jail cellor if hes struck by a bolt of lightningthen im going to blame some of the people in this roomand that i do not forgivebut that asidelet me say that i swearon the souls of my grandchildrenthat i will not be the one to break the peace weve made here todayshould i insist that all of tattaglias drug middlemen have clean recordsmention it dont insist barzini will

you go alongits about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in osloat the house of some friendsshe met a man about whom shed heard her whole lifea very great and courageous manhe opened up for her a whole beautiful worldfull of knowledge and thoughts and idealseverything she knew or ever became was because of himand she looked up to himand worshiped himwith a feeling she supposed was loveyes thats very prettyi heard a story once in fact ive heard a lot of stories in my timethey went along with the sound of a tinny pianoplaying in the parlor downstairsmister i met a man once when i was a kid theyd always begini guess neither one of our stories is very funnytell mewho was it you left me forwas it laszlo or were there others in betweenor arent you the kind that tellsi strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr blainei would suggest you search the caf\u00e3\u00a9 immediatelyif rick has the letters hes too smart to let you find them thereyou give him credit for too much clevernessmy impression was hes just another blundering americanwe mustnt underestimate american blunderingi was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918as to laszlo we want him watched 24 hours a dayit may interest you to know that at this very moment hes on his way herethere is nothing we can doim delighted to see you did you have a good nights resti slept very wellstrange nobodys supposed to sleep well in casablanca may we proceed with the business  with pleasure wont you sit downlaszlo we will not mince words youre an escaped prisoner of the reichso far you have been fortunate in eluding usyou have reached casablancait is my duty to see that you stay in casablancawhether or not you will succeed is problematicnot at all renaults signature is necessary on every visacaptain is it possible that laszlo will receive a visaim afraid not my regrets monsieurwell perhaps i shall like it in casablancaand mademoiselle you neednt be concerned about me  is that all you wish to tell usdont be in such a hurry you have all the time in the worldyou may be in casablanca indefinitelyor you may leave for lisbon tomorrow on one condition  and that isyou know the

a concentration campwhere you had more persuasive methods at your disposali certainly wont give them to you nowand what if you track down these men and kill themwhat if you murdered all of usfrom every corner of europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our placeseven nazis cant kill that fastherr laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understandbut in one aspect you are mistakenyou said the enemies of the reich could all be replacedbut there is one exceptionno one could take your place if anything unfortunateshould occur to you while you were trying to escapeyou wont dare to interfere with me herethis is still unoccupied franceany violation of neutrality would reflect on captain renault monsieur insofar as it is in my power  thank youby the way monsieur last night you evinced an interest in signor ugartei believe you have a message for himnothing important but may i speak to him nowyou would find the conversation a trifle onesidedsignor ugarte is deadim making

miseryyou know how you sound monsieur blainelike a man whos trying to convince himself of something he doesnt believe in his hearteach of us has a destiny for good or for evil i get the point  i wonder if you doi wonder if you know that youre trying to escape from yourselfand that youll never succeedyou seem to know all about my destinyi know a good deal more about you than you suspecti know that youre in love with a womanits perhaps a strange circumstancethat we both should be in love with the same womanthe first evening i came into this caf\u00e3\u00a9i knew there was something between you and ilsasince no one is to blamei demand no explanationi ask only one thing you wont give me the letters of transitall rightbut i want my wife to be safei ask you as a favorto use the letters to take her away from casablancayou love her that muchapparently you think of me only as the leader of a causewell i am also a human beingyes i love her that much monsieur laszlo  yesyoull come with us we have a warrant for your arreston what chargecaptain renault will discuss that with you laterit seems that destiny has taken a handyou havent any proof and you know it this isnt germany or occupied franceall you can do is fine him and give him 30 days you might as well let him go nowid advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszloif you were to help him escapewhat makes you think id stick my neck out for laszlobecause one you bet 10000 francs hed escapetwo youve got the letters of transit dont bother to deny itand you might do it simply because you dont like strassers looksas a matter of fact i dont eithertheyre all excellent reasonsdont count too much on my friendshipin this matter im powerless besides i might lose the 10000 francsyoure not very subtle but you are effective i get the pointyes i have the lettersbut i intend using them myselfim leaving casablanca on tonights plane the last planeand im taking a friend with me one youll appreciate what friend  ilsa lundthat ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escapethe last man i want to see in americayou didnt come here to tell me this you have the letters of transityou can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you pleasewhy are you still interested in what happens to laszloim not but i am interested in what happens to ilsa and mewe have a legal right to go thats truebut people have been held in casablanca in spite of their legal rights what makes you think we want to hold you  ilsa is laszlos wifeshe probably knows things that strasser would like to knowlouis ill make a deal with youinstead of this petty charge against him you could get something bigsomething that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years be quite a feather in your cap wouldnt it  certainlygermany vichy would be very gratefulthen release himyou be at my place a halfhour before the plane leavesill have laszlo come there to pick up the lettersand thatll give you grounds to make the arrestyou get him and we get awayto the germans that last will be just a minor annoyancetheres still something about this i dont quite understandmiss lund she is very beautiful yesbut you were never interested in any woman she isnt just any woman  i seehow do i know youll keep your end of the bargainill make the arrangements now with laszlo in the visitors penim gonna miss you youre the

molested kidsin six different parishes over the last 30 yearsand the attorney for the victims mrgarabedian thanks eileenmr garabedian says cardinal law found outabout it 15 years ago and did nothingyeah i think that attorneys a bit of a crankand the church dismissed the claimhe said she saidwhether mr garabedian is a crank or nothe says he has documents that prove the cardinal knewas i understand it those documents are under sealokay but the fact remains a boston priest abused 80 kidswe have a lawyer who says he can prove law knew about itand weve written all of uh two stories in the last six monthsthis strikes me as an essential story to a local paperi think at the very least we have to go through those documentshow would you like to do thatoh uhi dont know what the laws are herebut in florida we would go to courtyou want to sue the churchtechnically we wouldnt sue the churchwed file a motion to lift the seal on those documentsthe church will read that as us suing themso

kind of thingso youre screwed on the time limitand uheven if you argue your way around thatthe charitable immunity statute caps damages at 20 grandtwenty grand for molesting a childthat is the way the system is set up yesthe church is toughso your best shot is to try these casesin the press like i did on porterhmm but you know most of the victimsthey dont wanna have anything to do with tvand uhmitch isnt exactly a people personyeah and if garabedian cant get his victimsto go before the press then hes reallythats right he has a long road ahead of himmy guess is he doesnt have anything on

organization philwe had 11 at our last chapter meetinguh no 10 karen just movedyou had a woman in your groupof course there was a woman they dont discriminatenot when it comes to abuseand this has nothing to do with being gaywhat this is is priests using the collar to rape kidskids boys and girlsi was 11and i was preyed upon by father david holley in worcesterand i dont mean prayed for i mean preyed uponare any of you catholici was raised catholic now i go to my wifes presbyterian churchim lapsedi go to church with my grandmother sometimesits safe to say we were all raised catholic but nownot so muchokay well let me tell youwhen youre a poor kid from a poor family religion counts for a lotand when a priest pays attention to you its a big dealhe asks you to collect the hymnalsor take out the trash you feel specialits like god asking for helpso maybe its a little weird when he tells you a dirty jokebut now you got a secret together so you go alongthen he shows you a porno mag and you go alongand you go along and you go alonguntil one day he asks you to jerk him off or give him a blow joband so you go along with that toobecause you feel trappedbecause he has groomed youhow do you say no to god rightseeit is important to understand that this is not just physical abuseits spiritual abuse tooand when a priest does this to you he robs you of your faithso you reach for the bottle or the needleor if those dont work you jump off a bridgethats why we call ourselves survivorshave you read jason berrys bookhe wrote about the gauthe case in louisianauh thats g gauthehere and

phenomenonithats bighey mac heyif i wanted historical data on a priestparishes hed been assigned towhere would i find thatthe geoghan case its all in the clips lisa has the source materialyeah what if it was for another priestone that hadnt been in the papersyoure looking at another priest whore you looking atany ideasoh come on matt youre not going to tell mei gotta get to a meeting thanks machey stevethe archdiocese puts out an annual directoryevery priest and parish thats greatdo these go back any further than 98oh yeah going back to the 80s in the mezbeyond that you gotta go to the bplin the mez huh thanks lisa you bethe said they all target the same kind of kidlowincome families absentee fathers broken homesso a guy like geoghan goes after boys not because he prefers thembut because they have more shameless likely to talkthese guys are predators robbyand i talked to sipe he said hed seen dozens of themin the 60s in setonhe called it a phenomenonwhy didnt he go public he didbut the church made a huge effort to discredit himsmear campaigns public statements by prominent bishopsits just like saviano said and garabedianyou getting anywhere with himmore victims more victimsyou cant empty his pockets ill get to himi just need more time oh come on mikeyou gotta get him ill get him ill get himjesus what the hell is that smelltheres a dead rat in the cornerwhat have you got church directoriesits every priest in massachusettswhat parish theyre assigned toare these official yeahi figured it could help us track downsome of the priests that saviano mentionedmaybe find some more victimscan we turn on some more lights i couldnt find the switchyou wanna borrow my glasses no im good im goodlook 1983 john geoghan st brendan parish dorchesterso we can find out where any priest is in any given yearyeah i got him here athuhwhat1980 the year geoghan was pulled from jp it says hes on sick leavecome on it really says thatwhere is uh 1991here ya go let me see thisbarrett barrett liami cant read that look for a liam barrett in there1991s the year they pulled him out of charlestownbarrett liamyeah sick leaveits an official designationlets get these upstairsand matt check on those priests saviano gave us robby yeah i hey im down at the courthouseisomethings not right here nothing on shanley either sachaokay thanksyeah we need to go talk to macleish againireally whyi huh theres nothing herethere arent any records i checked every namethanks for waiting so sorry guys stuck on a callnot a problem how are you goodthanks for meeting us you bet whats up guysmr macleish are you familiar with a priest named paul shanleyyes i am familiar with himand have you settled cases against father shanleyas im sure you can understand i cant discuss that with youhow about uh father ronald paquinwell i cant discuss that with you either come on guyswe understand youve settled several cases against each of themeven if id been involved in those casesthe settlements would be confidentialand i could be disbarred for acknowledging their existenceokay mmmhmmlook i told you guys these are tough casesmost of these folks they just want some acknowledgmentof what happenedwe got em a sitdown with the bishop and a little doughand thats the best they could hope forwell its certainly the best the priests could hope forno the church promised theyd take the priests out of circulationand did you follow up on thatdo you guys need anything elseyes why arent there any recordsi was down at the courthouse earlierthere arent any records of any of these settlementswe dealt directly with the churchwe would draw up a demand letter and send it to the chanceryyou never filed anything in courtits a private mediationso this is just you and the archdioceses lawyersin a roomcorrectanyone elseoccasionally the church would bring in another defense attorney to help outyou have namesnopeno i dontso this was all under the tabletheres no paper trail at allthe victim has to sign a confidentiality agreementto get the settlementthe lawyer takes a third and the church sweeps it under the rugjeez its a freakin racketits more complicated than thatmacleishs got a duty to the client to get the best deal he cansure but how many victims do you represent and profit frombefore you say somethinggarabedian would say nonethats why hes taking these cases to courtbecause he wants people to know about thisi agree and legal ethics aside beni mean operating the way macleish hasall but guarantees that the abuse stays under wrapsyeah did macleish confirm all savianos priestsno hes limited by his confidentiality agreementbut clearly hes settled cases against a number of themphils put me in touch with some of the other victimsim pretty confident all of his priests are gonna check outso it is 13 priestsyeah looks that wayholy shitokay keep goingim sorry what was the name againuh baronbaronim having trouble finding it just give me a secondits okay kim i can vouch for himim pete

inclinedweve met reallydid he mention the suitno but he did give me a copy of the catechismyeah well the cardinals not known for his subtletyduring the porter investigationhed literally called down the power of god on the iglobeihowd that play outa week later our editor broke his leg skiingshrimp toast gentlemenno thanks noyou said one of the victims filed a criminal complaintyeah there were a few of thembut the judge had the case records sealedafter friends of the church complainedand the church has a lot of friendslike eric macleishyeahlets just say hes not part of the solutionyou follow what im saying sureyou work hard mr rezendesare you married yeahyour wife doesnt mind you working all the timeoh yeah she doesthats why i never got married im too busywhat i do is too importanthmmyour new editor hes a jew rightoh thats right yeah yeah seehe comes in and suddenly everybodys interested in the churchyou know whybecause it takes an outsider like meim armenianhow many armenians do you know in bostonsteve kurkjian works at the iglobeioh thats two you should get a prize or somethingwhat are you italian no im portuguesefrom where east bostonreally east bostonyou dont sound like itthis city these peoplemaking the rest of us feel like we dont belongbut theyre no better than uslook at how they treat their childrenmark my words mr rezendesif it takes a village to raise a childit takes a village to abuse onehey here he is want a beer love oneanother you here with barbarano she hates these things karen tooyeah smart ladiesisl\u00e3\u00a1inteimmmi met your new editorseemed like a decent fellow i think he ishey i had an interesting conversation with eric macleish the other dayturns out hes been settling abuse cases with the archdiocese for yearsyou really wanna talk about this herejim you said you helped out on father barrett as a favorthat was a oneoffhow many of these cases have you been involved withyou know i cant answer that robby its unethicalis that all it isso this would be the robby robinsonive always heard about but never metlisten to me jimmyyou wanna be on the right side of thisthis is the church youre talking about robbylook around these are good peopledone a lot of good for this cityenjoy the partyive been through a lot of these nowsick leave isnt the only designation they usewhen they take one of these priests out of circulationthey use a slew of terms absent on leaveunassigned emergency responsethey got a word for everything these guys hmm except rapeand they move parishes way more frequently than other priestswhen i was a kid a priest movedafter seven or eight years sometimes longerthese guys its two to three years topsand did they use these designations for all of savianos priestsyeah its a pretty clear patternguys i got sipeii think if you really want to understand the crisisiiyou need to start with the celibacy requirementiithat was my first major findingiionly 50 of the clergy are celibateiinow most of them are having sex with other adultsiibut the fact remains that this creates a culture of secrecyiithat tolerates and even protects pedophilesiso you believe the church is aware of the extent of this crisisioh absolutely after the first major scandal in louisianaiitom doyle the secretarycanonist for the papal nuncioiicoauthored a report warning pedophile priestsiiwere a billiondollar liabilityiithat was in 1985i1985 ithats rightiwho saw that report anyone from the catholic hierarchyisureiidoyle tried to introduce the report atiithe national conference of catholic bishopsiiin fact cardinal law initially helped to fund the reportiibut then he backed out and they shelved itiare you kidding merichard robby herewe think we have 13 priests in boston that fit this patternwhich would be a very very big storydoes that sound right to you in terms of scaleino not really robby it sounds low to meiimy estimates suggest 6 act out sexually with minorsiuh 6 of whati6 of all priestsihow many priests do we have in bostonabout 1500 1 is 156 is90all right 90 priests is that possibleifrom a metric standpointiiyes that would certainly be in line with my findingsiihelloiuhninety fucking priests in bostonthats what he saidif there were 90 of these bastards people would knowmaybe they doand no one said a thinggood germansi dont think thats a comparison you want to make publicallymacleish knew he just didnt say anythingthats 13 prieststheres a big difference between 13 and 90wheres this guy sipe getting his numberswell hes been studying it for 30 yearshe is a trained psychotherapistokay but we need something more than a metricfrom some hippy expriest whos shacking up with a nunokay so well track down more victims well get more prieststhen we can check them against the directoriesthats a shitload of victimswell get therehow longs it gonna taketoo longwait but meetings overyeah for nowlook whatve you got what if we work backwardswhat do you mean from what from the directoriesweve been using them
